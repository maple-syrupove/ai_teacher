    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: I was unable to determine a specific value for $M+m$ because my calculations became too complicated when I tried to directly differentiate the function.\nTeacher：Your approach is correct in recognizing the complexity of directly differentiating the function. However, you overlooked a key property of the function that could simplify the problem significantly. What is the relationship between the numerator and the denominator of the function?\nStudent：The numerator is $(x+1)^2+\\sin x$ and the denominator is $x^2+1$. They are similar in that both involve $x^2$ and constants, but the numerator also has $2x$ and $\\sin x$, while the denominator does not.\nTeacher：You correctly noted the similarity between the numerator and denominator, but you missed a crucial observation: the numerator can be rewritten in terms of the denominator. Specifically, $(x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$, so the numerator becomes $x^2 + 2x + 1 + \\sin x$. This allows us to express the function as $\\frac{x^2 + 1 + 2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} = 1 + \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$. What is the range of the term $\\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$?\nStudent：I didn't attempt to find the range of $\\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$—instead, I continued with direct differentiation and got stuck.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that analyzing the range of $\\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$ is key to solving the problem. What is the maximum and minimum value of this term?\nStudent：I haven't calculated the maximum or minimum of $\\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$ yet, since I stayed focused on differentiation and did not analyze this expression.\nTeacher：You have not explored the simplified expression $1 + \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$, which is essential for determining $M$ and $m$. What is the maximum and minimum value of $\\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$?\nStudent：I don't know the maximum or minimum value of $\\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$ because I didn't try to analyze it. I only tried to differentiate the original $f(x)$.\nTeacher：You have not simplified the function correctly. The numerator is $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x = x^2 + 2x + 1 + \\sin x$, and the denominator is $x^2 + 1$. Thus, the function simplifies to $1 + \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$. You failed to recognize this simplification.\nStudent：zzc",
