    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：What is the formula for $\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ in terms of $\\sin 2\\alpha$?\nStudent：I thought $\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1 - \\sin^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$, but I wasn’t sure how to link it directly to $\\sin 2\\alpha$.\nTeacher：What is the identity for $\\cos\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ in terms of $\\sin \\alpha$ and $\\cos \\alpha$?\nStudent：It's $\\cos\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\cos\\alpha\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\sin\\alpha\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\cos\\alpha - \\sin\\alpha}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nTeacher：What happens when you square this expression and simplify?\nStudent：When you square it, you get $\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{(\\cos\\alpha - \\sin\\alpha)^2}{2}$. This expands to $\\frac{\\cos^2\\alpha - 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha + \\sin^2\\alpha}{2}$.\nTeacher：Then, using $\\cos^2\\alpha + \\sin^2\\alpha = 1$ and $2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha = \\sin 2\\alpha$, you get $\\frac{1 - \\sin 2\\alpha}{2}$. You substituted $\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$, so the result is $\\frac{1 - \\frac{2}{3}}{2} = \\frac{1}{6}$. Your mistake was choosing C instead of A.\nStudent：I see, but I didn't realize the link and just substituted $\\sin 2\\alpha$ into $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$, not this formula.\nTeacher：You incorrectly substituted $\\sin 2\\alpha$ into $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ instead of using the derived formula $\\frac{1 - \\sin 2\\alpha}{2}$.\nStudent：zzc",
