    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Let me ask you: What is the value of $ (1+i)^2 $?\nStudent：The value of $(1+i)^2$ is $1^2 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i + (-1) = 2i$.\nTeacher：Then, what is $ i(1+i)^2 $?  \nStudent: $ i \\cdot 2i = 2i^2 = -2 $.  \nTeacher: So, the result is a real number, not purely imaginary. That means your choice of A is incorrect. Let me ask: Did you consider the nature of purely imaginary numbers?\nStudent：I didn’t actually check if the result was purely imaginary at the time. I just saw the $i$ and thought it must be imaginary.\nTeacher：You assumed that the presence of $ i $ automatically makes a number purely imaginary, but you didn't verify whether the final result had a real part. That was your error.\nStudent：zzc",
