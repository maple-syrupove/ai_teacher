    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：I need to understand your reasoning. Can you tell me what property you used to determine that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ would be an odd function?\nStudent：I thought that since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, multiplying and taking absolute value would make the function odd.\nTeacher：What does it mean for a function to be odd? Can you tell me the specific mathematical condition that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ would need to satisfy?\nStudent：A function is odd if for all $x$, $h(-x) = -h(x)$. So $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ would need $|f(-x)g(-x)| = -|f(x)g(x)|$.\nTeacher：You've correctly stated the condition for an odd function. Now, think carefully about the right side of your equation: $-|f(x)g(x)|$. What can you tell me about the sign of an absolute value expression?\nStudent：The absolute value is always non-negative, so $|f(x)g(x)|$ cannot be negative.\nTeacher：Exactly! Since absolute values are always non-negative, $|f(x)g(x)| \\geq 0$, which means $-|f(x)g(x)| \\leq 0$. \n\nBut you need $|f(-x)g(-x)| = -|f(x)g(x)|$ for the function to be odd. The left side is non-negative while the right side is non-positive. This equality can only hold when both sides equal zero.\n\nYour error is assuming that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ can be an odd function when absolute value functions cannot satisfy the odd function property (except at zero points).\nStudent：zzc",
