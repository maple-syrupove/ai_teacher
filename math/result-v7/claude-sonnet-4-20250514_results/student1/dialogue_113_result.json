    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1}.\nTeacher：Looking at your answer, you included all elements from set N. Let me ask: which elements from N = {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1} actually satisfy the condition -3 < x < 1 from set M?\nStudent：I included -3, -2, -1, 0, and 1 because they are all between -3 and 1.\nTeacher：You said they are \"between -3 and 1,\" but let's be more precise about the inequality -3 < x < 1. Does -3 satisfy -3 < x? Does 1 satisfy x < 1?\nStudent：-3 does not satisfy -3 < x, and 1 does not satisfy x < 1.\nTeacher：Good! You correctly identified that -3 and 1 don't satisfy the conditions. So which elements from N = {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1} actually do satisfy -3 < x < 1?\nStudent：The elements -2, -1, and 0 satisfy -3 < x < 1.\nTeacher：Excellent! You've correctly identified that only -2, -1, and 0 from set N satisfy the condition -3 < x < 1. So M ∩ N = {-2, -1, 0}, which is option C.\n\nYour initial error was including the boundary values -3 and 1, which don't satisfy the strict inequalities in the definition of set M.\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that M ∩ N = {-2, -1, 0} in our discussion. What specifically are you unsure about regarding this intersection or the problem?\nStudent：I'm unsure about how to decide which elements from set N can be included in the intersection with set M.\nTeacher：To find M ∩ N, you need to check which elements from N satisfy M's condition. For each element in N = {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1}, ask yourself: does this number satisfy -3 < x < 1? Which specific part of checking this inequality are you finding difficult?\nStudent：I'm not sure how to properly apply the strict inequality signs to determine which numbers fit.\nTeacher：Let's focus on the inequality -3 < x < 1. This means x must be greater than -3 AND less than 1.\n\nFor -2: Is -2 > -3? Is -2 < 1? \nFor 0: Is 0 > -3? Is 0 < 1?\n\nCan you check these conditions for -2 and 0?\nStudent：Yes. For -2: -2 > -3 is true, -2 < 1 is true.  \nFor 0: 0 > -3 is true, 0 < 1 is true.\nTeacher：Perfect! You understand how to check the strict inequalities correctly. \n\nNow apply this same method to check -3, -1, and 1 from set N. Which of these three elements satisfy both -3 < x AND x < 1?\nStudent：-3 does not satisfy -3 < x, so it's not included.  \n-1: -1 > -3 is true and -1 < 1 is true, so it's included.  \n1 does not satisfy x < 1, so it's not included.\nTeacher：Excellent! You've now correctly identified all elements:\n- -3: doesn't satisfy -3 < x ✗\n- -2: satisfies both conditions ✓\n- -1: satisfies both conditions ✓  \n- 0: satisfies both conditions ✓\n- 1: doesn't satisfy x < 1 ✗\n\nSo M ∩ N = {-2, -1, 0}. You've mastered checking strict inequalities!\nStudent：Thank you! I understand now: M ∩ N = {-2, -1, 0}.\nTeacher：You're welcome! You've successfully worked through the problem and correctly found that M ∩ N = {-2, -1, 0}, which corresponds to option C. \n\nYour understanding of how to check strict inequalities for set intersections is now solid. Well done!\nStudent：My answer is: {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1}.\nTeacher：We just worked through this problem together and you correctly identified that M ∩ N = {-2, -1, 0}. \n\nWhy are you now saying the answer is {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1} again? What's making you include -3 and 1 when you already determined they don't satisfy the strict inequalities?\nStudent：I thought that because -3 and 1 are at the endpoints of the interval, they should be included along with the other numbers.\nTeacher：I can see your specific error now: you're confusing strict inequalities with non-strict inequalities.\n\nThe set M uses strict inequalities: -3 < x < 1, which means x cannot equal the endpoints -3 or 1. Endpoints are only included when you have non-strict inequalities like -3 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nSince M has strict inequalities, the endpoints -3 and 1 are excluded from the intersection.\nStudent：zzc",
