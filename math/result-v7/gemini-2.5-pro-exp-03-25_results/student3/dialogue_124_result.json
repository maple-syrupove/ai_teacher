    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose D. $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Hello. To check your answer, could you please tell me the definition of an odd function?\nStudent：An odd function satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Excellent. And what is the definition of an even function?\nStudent：An even function satisfies $g(-x) = g(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Very good. Now, let's test your chosen option D. Let's define a new function, $H(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$. What is the expression for $H(-x)$?\nStudent：$H(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$\nTeacher：You are on the right track. How can you rewrite the expression inside the absolute value, $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$, using the properties of odd and even functions you stated earlier?\nStudent：Using the properties, $f(-x) = -f(x)$ and $g(-x) = g(x)$. So, $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：That's correct. Now, how does the expression $|-f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ relate to the original function, $H(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$?\nStudent：Since the absolute value ignores the sign, $|-f(x)\\cdot g(x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)| = H(x)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly shown that $H(-x) = H(x)$.\n\nBased on the definitions you provided earlier, what type of function has this property?\nStudent：A function with $H(-x)=H(x)$ for all $x$ is an even function.\nTeacher：You have correctly demonstrated that for the function in option D, `H(-x) = H(x)`. This is the definition of an even function.\n\nYour error was concluding that this function is odd, which contradicts your own correct derivation.\nStudent：zzc",
