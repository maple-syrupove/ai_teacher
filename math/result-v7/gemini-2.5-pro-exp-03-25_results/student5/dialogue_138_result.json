    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $\\frac{3}{10}$\nTeacher：Hello. Let's take a look at your answer. Can you tell me which sets of three numbers you found that form a Pythagorean triple?\nStudent：I found (2,3,4), (3,4,5), and (1,2,3) as possible triples.\nTeacher：What is the mathematical rule that the three side lengths of a right-angled triangle must satisfy?\nStudent：They must satisfy the equation a² + b² = c², where c is the largest number.\nTeacher：Let's apply that rule. For the set (1, 2, 3), do the numbers satisfy that equation?\nStudent：Let me check: \\(1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5\\), and \\(3^2 = 9\\). So no, they do not satisfy the equation.\nTeacher：Excellent. Now what about the set (2, 3, 4)? Does it satisfy the condition for being a right-angled triangle?\nStudent：\\(2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13\\), and \\(4^2 = 16\\). So, this set does not satisfy the equation either.\nTeacher：Very good. What is the result when you apply the same rule to your last identified set, (3, 4, 5)?\nStudent：\\(3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25\\), and \\(5^2 = 25\\). So, this set does satisfy the equation.\nTeacher：You have correctly tested the three sets you initially chose. Your mistake was in identifying the number of successful outcomes. You included sets that are not Pythagorean triples in your initial count.\nStudent：zzc",
