    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. $A \\cap B=\\varnothing$\nTeacher：Hello. Let's take a look at this problem. Could you first explain how you defined set B from the inequality given?\nStudent：Set B is $\\{x \\mid 3-2x>0\\}$, so I thought about the condition $3-2x>0$.\nTeacher：Very well. What steps did you take to solve for x in the inequality $3 - 2x > 0$?\nStudent：I saw $3 - 2x > 0$ and understood it's an inequality, but I didn’t solve for x.\nTeacher：To find the intersection of two sets, you need to know the elements of both sets. You have stated that you did not solve the inequality to determine the elements of set B.\nStudent：Yes, I only focused on the condition $3-2x>0$ but did not actually solve for $x$.\nTeacher：You did not solve the inequality $3-2x>0$ to determine the range of values for x that constitute set B. This step is necessary to correctly find the intersection with set A.\nStudent：zzc",
