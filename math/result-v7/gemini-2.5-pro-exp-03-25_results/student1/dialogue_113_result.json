    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: $\\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1\\}$.\nTeacher：Hello. Let's take a look at this problem together.\n\nCould you tell me what the condition `-3 < x` means for the numbers in set M?\nStudent：It means that the numbers in set M must be greater than -3.\nTeacher：Very good. And what about the other condition, `x < 1`? What does that tell us about the numbers in set M?\nStudent：It means that the numbers in set M must be less than 1.\nTeacher：You've clearly stated the two conditions for set M. Let's test an element from set N. Does the number -3 satisfy the condition `-3 < x`?\nStudent：No, -3 does not satisfy the condition `-3 < x`.\nTeacher：You are correct. Now, let's consider another number from N. Does the number 1 satisfy the condition `x < 1`?\nStudent：No, 1 does not satisfy the condition $x < 1$.\nTeacher：You have correctly determined which elements of N are not in M. However, you included these very elements in your final answer for the intersection.\nStudent：zzc",
