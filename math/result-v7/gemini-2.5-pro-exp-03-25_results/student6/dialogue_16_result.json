    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：Let's take a look at your work step-by-step. What was the first step you took after reading the problem?\nStudent：First, I noted that the two graphs become coincident after the shift, and I tried to set up an equation relating their expressions.\nTeacher：That's a logical first step. How did you mathematically express the cosine function after shifting its graph to the right?\nStudent：I wrote $y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：That expression is correct. What was your next step in your calculation?\nStudent：My next step was to try to set this equal to $y = \\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})$ and solve for $\\phi$.\nTeacher：How did you attempt to solve the equation, given that one side was a cosine function and the other was a sine function?\nStudent：I tried to compare the two sides directly, but I got stuck because they were different trigonometric functions, so I didn’t continue.\nTeacher：It's true that you cannot directly compare the arguments of a sine and a cosine function. Are you aware of any trigonometric identities that allow you to convert a sine function into a cosine function?\nStudent：Yes, $\\sin\\theta$ can be written as $\\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nTeacher：Excellent. How did you apply that identity to the equation you set up?\nStudent：I didn't apply that identity to the equation. I didn't think to use it during my solution process.\nTeacher：The error in your process was one of omission. You correctly set up the equation, but you halted your work because you did not apply the trigonometric identity you know to make the two sides of the equation comparable.\nStudent：zzc",
