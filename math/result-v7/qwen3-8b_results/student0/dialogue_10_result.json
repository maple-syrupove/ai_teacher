    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by directly differentiating $f(x)$ and solving $f'(x)=0$, but got stuck in the calculations and couldn't find $M+m$.\nTeacher：What did you obtain for $ f'(x) $?\nStudent：I wrote $f'(x) = \\frac{2(x+1) + \\cos x (x^2+1) - [(x+1)^2+\\sin x]2x}{(x^2+1)^2}$.\nTeacher：Your derivative is incorrect. Did you apply the quotient rule properly?\nStudent：I used the quotient rule, but I think I made a mistake multiplying out the terms in the numerator, especially with the derivatives of $(x+1)^2$ and $\\sin x$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the derivative of $(x+1)^2$ and $\\sin x$ in the numerator. Let's verify the derivative step-by-step. What is the derivative of $(x+1)^2$?\nStudent：The derivative of $(x+1)^2$ with respect to $x$ is $2(x+1)$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the derivative of $(x+1)^2$, but you forgot to apply the chain rule to $\\sin x$, which should be $\\cos x$. Let's proceed. What is the derivative of $\\sin x$?\nStudent：The derivative of $\\sin x$ with respect to $x$ is $\\cos x$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the derivative of $\\sin x$. Now, let's verify the entire numerator of $f'(x)$. What is the full expression for the numerator after applying the quotient rule?\nStudent：The numerator should be $[2(x+1) + \\cos x](x^2+1) - [(x+1)^2+\\sin x]\\cdot 2x$.\nTeacher：Your numerator is correct, but you did not simplify it properly. Let's examine the simplification step. What is the simplified form of the numerator?\nStudent：I tried to expand the terms, but it became $2(x+1)(x^2+1) + \\cos x (x^2+1) - 2x(x+1)^2 - 2x\\sin x$, which looked very complicated, so I got stuck and didn't continue.\nTeacher：You did not recognize that the numerator simplifies significantly, which is essential for finding critical points. Let's simplify it step by step. What is the simplified form of $2(x+1)(x^2+1) - 2x(x+1)^2$?\nStudent：$2(x+1)(x^2+1) - 2x(x+1)^2 = 2(x+1)(x^2+1 - x(x+1))$.\nTeacher：You correctly factored out $2(x+1)$, but the expression inside the parentheses is not simplified properly. Let's simplify $x^2 + 1 - x(x+1)$.\nStudent：$x^2+1-x(x+1)=x^2+1-x^2-x=1-x$.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified the expression to $1 - x$. Now, let's consider the entire numerator. Did you account for all terms in the simplified numerator?\nStudent：I think I still had the terms $\\cos x(x^2+1)$ and $-2x\\sin x$ left, so the numerator would be $2(x+1)(1-x)+\\cos x(x^2+1)-2x\\sin x$.\nTeacher：You have not accounted for the entire simplification process. Let's examine the full simplified numerator. What is the final simplified form of the numerator?\nStudent：The final numerator is $2(x+1)(1-x)+\\cos x(x^2+1)-2x\\sin x$.\nTeacher：You have not simplified the entire expression correctly. The term $2(x+1)(1-x)$ simplifies to $-2(x^2 - 1)$. However, you did not combine this with the other terms properly. Let's examine the full simplified numerator again.\nStudent：I see. Then the full numerator is $-2(x^2-1)+\\cos x(x^2+1)-2x\\sin x$.\nTeacher：You have not simplified the entire expression correctly. The term $-2(x^2 - 1)$ should be combined with the other terms, but you did not account for all simplifications properly. Let's examine the full simplified numerator again.\nStudent：I'm sorry, I thought $-2(x^2-1)+\\cos x(x^2+1)-2x\\sin x$ was already the simplest, but maybe I missed further simplification steps.\nTeacher：You have not fully simplified the numerator, and this oversight prevents you from identifying critical points necessary to find $ M + m $. Let's examine the full simplified numerator again.\nStudent：I'm not sure how to further simplify the numerator beyond $-2(x^2-1)+\\cos x(x^2+1)-2x\\sin x$.\nTeacher：You have not recognized that the simplified numerator can be further analyzed for symmetry or specific values, which is essential for identifying $ M + m $. Let's consider evaluating the function at specific points. What is $ f(0) $?\nStudent：$f(0) = \\frac{(0+1)^2 + \\sin 0}{0^2 + 1} = \\frac{1 + 0}{1} = 1$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $ f(0) $, but you did not recognize that the function has symmetry or that evaluating at specific points is not sufficient to determine $ M + m $. Let's consider the behavior of $ f(x) $ as $ x \\to \\infty $ and $ x \\to -\\infty $. What happens to $ f(x) $ as $ x \\to \\infty $?\nStudent：As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2+1} \\approx \\frac{x^2 + 2x + 1}{x^2} = 1 + \\frac{2x + 1}{x^2} \\to 1$.\nTeacher：You have not recognized that the function is symmetric about $ x = 0 $, which implies $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $. This symmetry allows you to conclude that $ M + m = 2 $.\nStudent：zzc",
