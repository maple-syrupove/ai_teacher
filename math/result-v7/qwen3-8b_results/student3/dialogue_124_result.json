    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：D. $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Let's analyze the properties of $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $. If $ f(x) $ is odd and $ g(x) $ is even, what happens to $ f(-x) \\cdot g(-x) $? What does this imply about $ |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| $?\nStudent：For $f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)$, since $f(x)$ is odd, $f(-x) = -f(x)$, and since $g(x)$ is even, $g(-x) = g(x)$. So $f(-x) \\cdot g(-x) = -f(x) \\cdot g(x)$. Thus, $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：Then, what does this tell us about the symmetry of $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $? Is it odd, even, or neither?\nStudent：It tells us that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function because $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：Then, what does this imply about the correctness of option D?\nStudent：Option D is incorrect because $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function, not an odd function.\nTeacher：Then, what conclusion can you draw about the correctness of the options?\nStudent：Since D is incorrect, I need to check the other options step by step to see which one is correct.\nTeacher：Let’s examine option C: $ f(x) \\cdot |g(x)| $. What happens to $ f(-x) \\cdot |g(-x)| $? Recall $ g(-x) = g(x) $, so $ |g(-x)| = |g(x)| $. What does this imply about the symmetry of $ f(x) \\cdot |g(x)| $?\nStudent：For $f(-x) \\cdot |g(-x)|$, we get $(-f(x)) \\cdot |g(x)| = -f(x) \\cdot |g(x)|$. So $f(x) \\cdot |g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Then, what does this imply about the correctness of option C?\nStudent：Option C is correct because $f(x) \\cdot |g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Then, what does this imply about the correctness of option C?\nStudent：Option C is the correct answer.\nTeacher：Then, what does this imply about the correctness of option C?\nStudent：Option C is correct, as $f(x)\\cdot|g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that option C is the correct answer.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher.\nTeacher：You are welcome. I am glad we could clarify the concepts together.\nStudent：D. $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Let's analyze the properties of $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $. If $ f(x) $ is odd and $ g(x) $ is even, what happens to $ f(-x) \\cdot g(-x) $?

Now, let’s examine option C: $ f(x) \\cdot |g(x)| $. What happens to $ f(-x) \\cdot |g(-x)| $? Recall $ g(-x) = g(x) $, so $ |g(-x)| = |g(x)| $.
