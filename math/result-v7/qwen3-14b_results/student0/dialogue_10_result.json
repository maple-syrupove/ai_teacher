    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to differentiate $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^{2}+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$ directly, but the calculation was too complex and I couldn’t complete it, so I didn’t get a final answer for $M+m$.\nTeacher：Did you consider simplifying the function before differentiating?\nStudent：No, I tried to work with the original expression without any simplification.\nTeacher：What is the derivative of the numerator $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x$?\nStudent：The derivative is $2(x+1) + \\cos x$.\nTeacher：That is correct. What about the derivative of the denominator $x^2 + 1$?\nStudent：The derivative of $x^2 + 1$ is $2x$.\nTeacher：Correct. Now, recall the quotient rule for derivatives: if $ f(x) = \\frac{u(x)}{v(x)} $, then $ f'(x) = \\frac{u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)}{[v(x)]^2} $. Did you apply this rule correctly when differentiating $ f(x) $?\nStudent：I tried to apply the quotient rule, but my calculation became messy and complicated, so I couldn't finish it.\nTeacher：It seems you encountered difficulties due to the complexity of the derivative expression. Did you attempt to simplify the function before applying the quotient rule?\nStudent：No, I worked with the original function and did not try to simplify it first.\nTeacher：Instead of simplifying the function, you proceeded directly to differentiate it, which led to complex calculations. Have you considered expanding or rewriting the numerator to simplify the expression?\nStudent：No, I didn’t try expanding or rewriting the numerator before differentiating.\nTeacher：Your mistake was not simplifying the function before differentiating, which led to overly complex calculations. Did you consider expanding the numerator $(x+1)^2$?\nStudent：No, I did not consider expanding $(x+1)^2$ before differentiating.\nTeacher：Your mistake was not simplifying the function before differentiating, which led to overly complex calculations. Did you consider expanding $(x+1)^2$?\nStudent：No, I did not consider expanding $(x+1)^2$ before differentiating.\nTeacher：Your mistake was not simplifying the function before differentiating, which led to overly complex calculations.
