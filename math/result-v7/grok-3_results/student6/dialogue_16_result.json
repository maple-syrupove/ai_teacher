    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：Can you explain why you think $\\phi$ cannot be solved? What specific aspect of the problem is causing you difficulty?\nStudent：I notice that the two functions are in different forms, one is cosine and the other is sine, so I didn't know how to set up an equation between them.\nTeacher：I see. Are you familiar with any identities or relationships that might help transform a cosine function into a sine function, or vice versa, to compare them more easily?\nStudent：I know basic identities like $\\sin \\theta = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta)$, but I didn't think to use them here.\nTeacher：Understood. Have you considered how shifting the cosine function might relate to a sine function through a specific identity or phase adjustment?\nStudent：No, I didn't think about relating the shift to a sine function using a phase identity.\nTeacher：Have you tried expressing both functions in a similar form to compare their phases after the shift?\nStudent：No, I didn't try expressing both functions in a similar form.\nTeacher：Alright. Are you aware of how a phase shift in a trigonometric function affects its graph, and could this help in aligning the two functions?\nStudent：I know that a phase shift moves the graph left or right, but I wasn't sure how to use that to compare these two functions directly.\nTeacher：I understand. Have you considered how much the cosine function’s phase shift of π/2 to the right changes its argument, and how that might match the sine function’s phase?\nStudent：I didn't consider how the phase shift would adjust the argument to possibly match the sine function's phase.\nTeacher：Let's think carefully. Does a right shift by π/2 in y=cos(2x+φ) mean adjusting the argument to 2x+φ-π? How does that help in comparing to the sine function?\nStudent：If I shift the cosine graph to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, then the argument becomes $2x + \\phi - \\pi$. But I still don't see how to set up the equation with the sine function.\nTeacher：I see. Have you considered whether the shift in the cosine function’s argument, now 2x + φ - π, should equal the sine function’s argument or relate through an identity?\nStudent：I haven't considered relating them through an identity after the shift. I wasn't sure how to connect their arguments directly.\nTeacher：Understood. Have you thought about using a trigonometric identity to express sine in terms of cosine, or vice versa, to make their arguments comparable after the shift?\nStudent：No, I didn't think to use a trigonometric identity to convert one function into the other after the shift.\nTeacher：I notice a consistent gap in your approach. Are you aware of specific identities that link sine and cosine functions through phase differences, which could be applied after accounting for the shift?\nStudent：I know such identities exist, but I didn't apply them or think about using them to connect the two after the shift.\nTeacher：Understood. Have you considered how a specific identity, like sine in terms of cosine with a phase difference, could relate the shifted cosine to the given sine function?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider using that specific identity to relate the shifted cosine to the sine function.\nTeacher：I’ve identified the core issue. Your mistake lies in not applying a trigonometric identity to relate the shifted cosine function to the sine function. This step is crucial for comparing their phases.\nStudent：zzc",
