If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Can you explain why you think $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ would be an odd function? What properties are you considering?\nStudent：I thought that since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, multiplying them would result in an odd function, and taking the absolute value wouldn't affect the oddness.\nTeacher：Let's examine this step-by-step. Does taking the absolute value of a function preserve its odd or even nature? Can you think about how $|h(x)|$ behaves for any function $h(x)$?\nStudent：Taking the absolute value generally makes the function even, since $|h(-x)| = |h(x)|$ for any $h(x)$.\nTeacher：You're on the right track. Given that $|h(-x)| = |h(x)|$, what does this imply specifically about the nature of $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$?\nStudent：It means $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function, not an odd function.\nTeacher：I see you've realized the key point. Your mistake was assuming that the absolute value wouldn't affect the oddness. In reality, taking the absolute value of any function results in an even function.\nStudent：zzc",
