    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose B.\nTeacher：Can you explain why you think the intersection of sets A and B is empty?\nStudent：Because I thought A is x<2, and then I tried to take the intersection with B, but couldn't match the answer options, so I picked ∅.\nTeacher：Let's clarify the conditions for set B. Can you rewrite the inequality 3 - 2x > 0 to define the range of x in set B?\nStudent：Sure. Starting from 3 - 2x > 0, we get 3 > 2x, or x < 3/2. So B = {x | x < 3/2}.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying that. Now, with set A as {x | x < 2} and set B as {x | x < 3/2}, can you describe what the intersection A ∩ B would represent in terms of x?\nStudent：The intersection A ∩ B would represent the values of x that satisfy both x < 2 and x < 3/2.\nTeacher：So, considering both conditions, which values of x would be in both sets A and B? Can you identify the more restrictive condition?\nStudent：The more restrictive condition is x < 3/2. So, the intersection would be x < 3/2.\nTeacher：Understood. Based on your reasoning, I can see the mistake. You correctly identified that the intersection A ∩ B is x < 3/2, but you chose option B (empty set). The error is in selecting B instead of A.\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：That's okay. Let’s take a step back. Can you explain why you initially thought the intersection might be empty, despite your reasoning about x < 3/2?\nStudent：I thought that none of the options matched exactly what I calculated, so I felt the intersection might be empty and chose option B.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining. Can you clarify why you felt none of the options matched your calculation of x < 3/2 for the intersection?\nStudent：Because I was expecting the answer to look exactly like what I wrote: {x | x < 2}. When I didn’t see that, I wasn’t sure and picked ∅.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. I can now see the mistake. You calculated the intersection as x < 3/2 but chose B (empty set) because you expected to see x < 2. The error is in not recognizing that option A matches your calculation.\nStudent：zzc",
