What happens when you substitute $-x$ into $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$?\nStudent：If we substitute $-x$ into $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$, we get $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)|$.\nTeacher：Since \\(f(x)\\) is odd (\\(f(-x)= -f(x)\\)) and \\(g(x)\\) is even (\\(g(-x)=g(x)\\)), then \\(|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = |-f(x)\\cdot g(x)|=|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|\\).
