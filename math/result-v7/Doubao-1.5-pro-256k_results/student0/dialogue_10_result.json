    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to differentiate $f(x)$ directly and solve $f'(x)=0$, but the calculation got too complicated, and I couldn’t find $M+m$.\nTeacher：Instead of differentiating directly, have you considered the property of the function? Notice that $f(x)$ can be rewritten in a certain form. Can you rewrite $f(x)$ as the sum of a constant and another function? What do you think about the symmetry of that new function? \nStudent：I didn't consider rewriting $f(x)$; I just worked with the original form. I’m not sure how to split it into a sum of functions.\nTeacher：Rewrite \\(f(x)=\\frac{(x + 1)^{2}+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}=\\frac{x^{2}+2x + 1+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}=1+\\frac{2x+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}\\). Now, what can you say about the function \\(g(x)=\\frac{2x+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}\\) in terms of odd - even property?\nStudent：Let me check: $g(-x) = \\frac{2(-x) + \\sin(-x)}{(-x)^2 + 1} = \\frac{-2x - \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} = -g(x)$. So $g(x)$ is odd.\nTeacher：Since \\(g(x)\\) is odd, for an odd function, if its maximum value is \\(g(x_{1}) = M - 1\\) and minimum value is \\(g(x_{2}) = m - 1\\), what property do \\(g(x_{1})\\) and \\(g(x_{2})\\) satisfy? (Because \\(f(x)=1 + g(x)\\), and we want to find \\(M + m\\) for \\(f(x)\\)).\nStudent：For an odd function, the maximum and minimum values are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, so $g(x_1) + g(x_2) = 0$.\nTeacher：Correct. Since \\(g(x)\\) is odd and \\(f(x)=1 + g(x)\\), then \\((M - 1)+(m - 1)=0\\). So \\(M + m = 2\\). Now, if you understand, you can say \"zzc\" to end this session. \nStudent：zzc",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by differentiating $f(x)$ directly, but the calculation got too complicated, and I wasn't able to find a specific value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：Instead of differentiating directly, consider the form of the function. Can you rewrite $f(x)$ in a different way? Notice if there's any special property of the function structure that could simplify the problem of finding $M + m$.\nStudent：I didn't attempt to rewrite $f(x)$. I worked with it as $\\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2+1}$ directly.\nTeacher：Have you considered separating the function into parts? Split $\\frac{(x + 1)^{2}+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$ into $\\frac{x^{2}+2x + 1+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$. What would be the benefit of doing this in relation to finding $M + m$?\nStudent：If I split the numerator, I get $\\frac{x^2 + 2x + 1}{x^2 + 1} + \\frac{\\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$, which might make it easier to analyze.\nTeacher：Good. Now, is there a property of odd - or even - functions that could help here? Specifically, look at the terms $\\frac{2x+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$. What do you know about the nature of $y = 2x+\\sin x$ and how might that relate to the sum of the maximum and minimum of $f(x)$?\nStudent：$2x$ is an odd function and $\\sin x$ is also odd, so their sum is odd. Dividing by $x^2+1$ (even), the whole term is odd.\nTeacher：Since the function $g(x)=\\frac{2x+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$ is odd, for an odd function $g(x)$ with maximum value $G_{max}$ and minimum value $G_{min}$, we have $G_{max}+G_{min}=0$.
