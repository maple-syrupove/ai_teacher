    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：Do you recall the rule for horizontal shift of a trigonometric function? How does shifting $y = \\cos(2x+\\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units affect the function's expression?\nStudent：If we shift $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the new function becomes $y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：Good. Now, simplify the expression $\\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2})+\\phi)$. What do you get when you expand it? This will help us see if there's an error in relating it to $y=\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})$. \nStudent：Expanding it gives $y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：What identity do you use to transform $\\cos(2x - \\pi+\\phi)$ into a form comparable with $\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})$? Is there an error in your application of trigonometric identities in this step?\nStudent：I didn't use any identity to transform $\\cos(2x-\\pi+\\phi)$ into another form at this step.\nTeacher：Since you need to equate $\\cos(2x - \\pi+\\phi)$ with $\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})$, you should use the trigonometric identity $\\cos(A - \\pi)=-\\cos A$ to transform $\\cos(2x - \\pi+\\phi)$ first. Your error is not applying the appropriate identity at this stage.\nStudent：That’s not the mistake I made.\nTeacher：If not that, then are you sure you've correctly accounted for the relationship between cosine and sine functions? Remember, there are co - function identities that might be relevant when equating $\\cos(2x - \\pi+\\phi)$ to $\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})$.\nStudent：I didn't use the co-function identity between sine and cosine to relate the two forms.\nTeacher：Your mistake is that you failed to use the co - function identity between sine and cosine to establish a connection between $\\cos(2x - \\pi+\\phi)$ and $\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})$. \nStudent：zzc",
