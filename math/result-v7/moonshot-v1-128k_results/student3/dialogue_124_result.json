    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Is it correct to say that the absolute value of a product of an odd and even function is odd?\nStudent：I thought it was correct, so I picked D.\nTeacher：Why do you think that the absolute value of an odd function times an even function is odd?\nStudent：Because I assumed that multiplying an odd and an even function might keep some oddness, and taking absolute value wouldn’t change that.\nTeacher：You assumed that the absolute value wouldn't change the oddness. However, the absolute value of any real number is always non-negative, which affects the function's symmetry.\nStudent：I didn't consider that the absolute value would change the function's properties with respect to oddness or evenness.\nTeacher：You assumed that the absolute value wouldn't change the oddness. Is that correct?\nStudent：No, that's not correct. The absolute value can change whether a function is odd or even.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that the absolute value can change whether a function is odd or even. Is there a mistake in assuming that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is odd?\nStudent：Yes, there is a mistake. Taking the absolute value can make the function no longer odd.\nTeacher：Correct. Is there any other mistake in your reasoning?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：Your initial assumption was that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nStudent：Yes, my initial choice was D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Your initial assumption was that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nStudent：Yes, my initial assumption was D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Your initial assumption was incorrect.\nStudent：Okay, I understand. What should I do next to find the correct answer?\nTeacher：Re-evaluate the properties of odd and even functions when multiplied and take absolute values.\nStudent：Alright, I'll go through each option and check their properties with respect to oddness and evenness.\nTeacher：Did you consider the properties of the absolute value when determining the parity of the functions?\nStudent：No, I didn't carefully consider how the absolute value changes the function's parity.\nTeacher：Correct. The absolute value always results in a non-negative output, which affects the function's parity.\nStudent：I see that now. I should check parity by substituting $-x$ in each function, right?\nTeacher：Yes, that's the correct approach.\nStudent：Okay, I will analyze each option by substituting $-x$ into the expressions to check their properties.\nTeacher：Good, analyzing each option by substituting $-x$ will help determine their parity.\nStudent：Thank you, I will use the definition and substitute $-x$ into each function to check their parity.\nTeacher：zzc\nStudent：zzc",
