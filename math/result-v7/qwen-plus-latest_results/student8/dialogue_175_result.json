    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Let’s examine your choice. You selected A: $ i(1+i)^2 $. First, did you expand $ (1+i)^2 $ correctly? What did you get for $ (1+i)^2 $?\nStudent：I got $(1+i)^2 = 1^2 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2$.\nTeacher：You correctly expanded $(1+i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2$. Now, what did you get after substituting $i^2 = -1$ and simplifying?\nStudent：After substituting $i^2 = -1$, I got $1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$.\nTeacher：You correctly found $(1+i)^2 = 2i$. Now, what do you get when you multiply this result by $i$, as in $i(1+i)^2 = i \\cdot 2i$?\nStudent：Multiplying $i$ by $2i$ gives $2i^2$, which simplifies to $2(-1) = -2$.\nTeacher：You correctly computed $ i(1+i)^2 = -2 $. However, $-2$ is a real number, not a purely imaginary number. Your mistake is in identifying the nature of the result: a purely imaginary number has no real part, but your result has no imaginary part. Thus, option A does not yield a purely imaginary number.\nStudent：Okay, I see.\nTeacher：You're on the right track. Now, let’s check option C: $(1+i)^2$. You already found this equals $2i$. Is $2i$ purely imaginary? Yes—it has no real part. So, your error was not in calculation, but in selecting the wrong option despite correct work. Option C, not A, gives a purely imaginary number.\nStudent：Okay, I see.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $(1+i)^2 = 2i$, which is purely imaginary, and that $i(1+i)^2 = -2$, which is real. Your error was selecting option A instead of option C, even though your calculations were correct. Option C is the expression that yields a purely imaginary number.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated that $(1+i)^2 = 2i$, a purely imaginary number, and that $i(1+i)^2 = -2$, a real number. Your mistake was selecting option A, which evaluates to a real number, instead of option C, which is purely imaginary. Thus, the correct choice should have been C.\nStudent：zzc",
