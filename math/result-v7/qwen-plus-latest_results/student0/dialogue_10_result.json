    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by directly differentiating $f(x)$ and setting $f'(x)=0$, but the calculation got too complicated and I couldn’t finish it.\nTeacher：You're correct that directly differentiating $ f(x) $ leads to a complicated expression. However, the function has a special symmetry. Consider whether $ f(x) + f(-x) $ simplifies to a constant. Have you explored that?\nStudent：No, I didn’t try adding $f(x)$ and $f(-x)$. Should I compute $f(x) + f(-x)$?\nTeacher：Yes, compute $ f(x) + f(-x) $. You’ll find it simplifies to a constant. This symmetry implies $ M + m $ equals that constant, due to the function's behavior under $ x \\to -x $. Try the addition carefully.\nStudent：Okay, so $f(-x)=\\frac{(-x+1)^2+\\sin(-x)}{x^2+1}$. Adding, $f(x)+f(-x)=\\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x+(-x+1)^2-\\sin x}{x^2+1}$.\nTeacher：You correctly computed $ f(-x) $ and started simplifying $ f(x) + f(-x) $. However, you made an error in expanding $ (-x + 1)^2 $. It should be $ (1 - x)^2 = (x - 1)^2 $, which is $ x^2 - 2x + 1 $, not $ x^2 + 2x + 1 $. Check your expansion again.\nStudent：You're right, $(-x+1)^2$ expands to $x^2 - 2x + 1$. So,\n$f(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x + x^2 - 2x + 1 - \\sin x}{x^2+1}$.\nTeacher：You made an error in simplifying the numerator. Specifically, $(x+1)^2$ is $x^2 + 2x + 1$, and you already have $x^2 - 2x + 1$ from $(-x+1)^2$. When you add them, the $2x$ and $-2x$ cancel, but you must correctly combine all terms. Recheck the sum of $(x+1)^2$ and $(1 - x)^2$.\nStudent：$(x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 1) + (1 - 2x + x^2) = 2x^2 + 2$.\nTeacher：Correct. Now substitute this back into the expression for $ f(x) + f(-x) $. You should find it simplifies to a constant. What is that constant?\nStudent：So $f(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{2x^2 + 2}{x^2 + 1}$. This simplifies to $2$.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified $ f(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{2x^2 + 2}{x^2 + 1} = 2 $. This means $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $ for all $ x $. Therefore, the function is symmetric in such a way that $ M + m = 2 $. Your error was not in this final step — but earlier, in not recognizing that this sum being constant immediately implies the maximum and minimum values are symmetric about 1, so their sum is exactly 2. No further calculation is needed.\nStudent：zzc",
