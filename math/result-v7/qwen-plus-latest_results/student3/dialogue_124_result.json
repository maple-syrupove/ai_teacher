    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose D.\nTeacher：Let’s examine your choice. You selected D: $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is an odd function.\n\nRecall that a function $ h(x) $ is odd if $ h(-x) = -h(x) $, and even if $ h(-x) = h(x) $.\n\nNow, consider what happens when you evaluate $ |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| $. Since $ f $ is odd, $ f(-x) = -f(x) $, and since $ g $ is even, $ g(-x) = g(x) $.\n\nSo, $ |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |{-f(x)} \\cdot g(x)| = |{-1} \\cdot f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $.\n\nThus, $ |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $, meaning the function is even, not odd.\n\nYour mistake is assuming that the absolute value preserves oddness, but in fact, it often destroys it by making the function symmetric about the y-axis.\n\n**Error: Absolute value of an odd function is not necessarily odd; in this case, $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is even, not odd.**\nStudent：I see.\nTeacher：You're on the right track. Let's check your understanding: if $ f(x) $ is odd and $ g(x) $ is even, what symmetry does $ f(x) \\cdot g(x) $ have?  \nCompute $ f(-x) \\cdot g(-x) $ and compare it to $ f(x) \\cdot g(x) $. What do you get?\nStudent：$f(-x)\\cdot g(-x) = (-f(x))\\cdot g(x) = -f(x)\\cdot g(x)$, so $f(x)\\cdot g(x)$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Correct: $ f(x) \\cdot g(x) $ is odd.  \n\nNow consider option C: $ f(x) \\cdot |g(x)| $.  \nSince $ g(x) $ is even, what can you say about $ |g(-x)| $?  \nThen evaluate $ f(-x) \\cdot |g(-x)| $ and compare it to $ f(x) \\cdot |g(x)| $.  \nIs the result odd or even?\nStudent：Since $g(x)$ is even, $|g(-x)| = |g(x)|$. So,\n$f(-x) \\cdot |g(-x)| = -f(x) \\cdot |g(x)|$, which means it is odd.\nTeacher：Correct: $ f(-x) \\cdot |g(x)| = -f(x) \\cdot |g(x)| $, so $ f(x) \\cdot |g(x)| $ is odd.  \n\nYour mistake was in choosing D, which is actually even, not odd.  \n**Error: $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is even because absolute value removes sign changes, making the function symmetric about the y-axis.**\nStudent：I see.\nTeacher：You now correctly understand that $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is even, not odd, due to the absolute value eliminating the sign change needed for oddness.  \n\nIs there another option you'd like to reconsider?\nStudent：I'd like to reconsider C: $f(x)\\cdot|g(x)|$.\nTeacher：You already confirmed that $ f(-x) \\cdot |g(-x)| = -f(x) \\cdot |g(x)| $, which means $ f(x) \\cdot |g(x)| $ is indeed odd.  \n\nSo, your reevaluation of C is correct — **C is the correct answer**.  \n\nYour earlier error was choosing D, which is even, not odd.  \n**Final error identification: $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is even, so D is incorrect.**\nStudent：I see.\nTeacher：You correctly now understand that $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is even, not odd, so D is incorrect.  \n\nYour initial mistake was overlooking how the absolute value affects symmetry — it forces non-negativity and typically results in even symmetry, especially when applied to a product where the sign change from the odd function is canceled out.  \n\nNo further errors remain; you've correctly identified that C is the right choice.\nStudent：Okay.\nTeacher：You've correctly identified that C is the correct answer. Your initial error was selecting D, which is incorrect because $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is even, not odd — the absolute value eliminates the sign change, resulting in a function symmetric about the y-axis.\nStudent：zzc",
