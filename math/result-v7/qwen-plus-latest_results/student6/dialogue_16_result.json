    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：Let’s examine your reasoning. You claim φ cannot be solved. But the problem states the shifted cosine graph coincides with a given sine graph. That implies a specific phase relationship.  \n\nCould you explain why you think no value of φ satisfies this condition? Consider: can a cosine function, when shifted, match a sine function of the same frequency? Think about identities—could $ \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta + \\text{something}) $ play a role?  \n\nWait for your response.\nStudent：I thought since one was cosine and the other was sine, and their forms were different, I couldn’t make them exactly match just by shifting. So I assumed φ couldn’t be found.\nTeacher：You're right that sine and cosine are different, but they are related by a phase shift. Specifically, $\\cos(\\theta) = \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. So a cosine function *can* match a sine function via phase shift.\n\nNow, the function $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ is shifted right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. That means we replace $x$ with $x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. What does the expression become after this shift?\n\nPlease write the new function after the shift.\nStudent：After the shift, the function becomes $y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi) = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：Correct, the shifted function is $ y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) $.  \n\nThis is equal to $ y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) $ for all $ x $.  \n\nRecall that $ \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $. So we can write:  \n$$\n\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) = \\sin\\left(2x - \\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\phi\\right)\n$$\n\nThis must equal $ \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) $.  \n\nSo the arguments must differ by a multiple of $ 2\\pi $, or be equal modulo $ 2\\pi $.  \n\nSet $ 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\phi = 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi $, then solve for $ \\phi $.  \n\nBut you may have assumed the functions are equal only if the phases match exactly without accounting for the identity shift.  \n\nYour mistake: **You likely ignored the effect of the trigonometric identity relating cosine and sine when equating the phases.** The equality requires using $ \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) $, but you may have directly equated the arguments of cosine and sine, which is invalid.  \n\nWait for your response.\nStudent：zzc",
