    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $(1,+\\infty)$\nTeacher：What is the domain of the function $ f(x) = \\ln(x^2 - 2x - 8) $?\nStudent：The domain is $x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0$, which gives $x < -2$ or $x > 4$.\nTeacher：Good. Then, what is the derivative of $ f(x) $?\nStudent：The derivative is $f'(x) = \\dfrac{1}{x^2 - 2x - 8} \\cdot (2x - 2) = \\dfrac{2(x-1)}{x^2 - 2x - 8}$.\nTeacher：On which intervals should we analyze the sign of $ f'(x) $, given the domain?\nStudent：We should analyze the sign of $f'(x)$ on $(-\\infty, -2)$ and $(4, +\\infty)$.\nTeacher：What is the sign of $ f'(x) $ on the interval $ (-\\infty, -2) $?\nStudent：On $(-\\infty, -2)$, $f'(x)$ is negative because $x-1 < 0$ and $x^2-2x-8 > 0$, so $f'(x)<0$.\nTeacher：What is the sign of $ f'(x) $ on the interval $ (4, +\\infty) $?\nStudent：On $(4, +\\infty)$, both $x-1 > 0$ and $x^2-2x-8 > 0$, so $f'(x) > 0$.\nTeacher：Then why did you choose the interval (1, +∞) instead of (4, +∞)?\nStudent：Because I set $f'(x) > 0$ and solved $x > 1$ without considering the domain.\nTeacher：Correct, you incorrectly solved $f'(x) > 0$ over the entire real line instead of only on the domain of $f(x)$. This led to an invalid interval.\nStudent：zzc",
