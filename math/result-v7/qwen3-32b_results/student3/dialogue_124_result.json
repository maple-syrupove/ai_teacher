    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x) \\bullet g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Can you explain why you believe the absolute value of the product makes it an odd function?\nStudent：I thought that since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, their product might still somehow be odd, and then the absolute value would keep that.\nTeacher：Can you clarify how the absolute value affects the parity of an odd function?\nStudent：I think the absolute value just keeps the sign positive, but I'm not sure how it changes the oddness of the function.\nTeacher：So, you're saying that taking the absolute value preserves the oddness of a function. Is that always true?\nStudent：I’m not completely sure. I thought maybe the shape would just flip upward, so I guessed it might still be odd.\nTeacher：What is the mathematical definition of an odd function?\nStudent：An odd function satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Now, can you apply this definition to the function $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $? What is $ |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| $ equal to?\nStudent：$|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |f(-x)| \\cdot |g(-x)|$\nTeacher：What is $f(-x)$ equal to, given that $f(x)$ is odd?\nStudent：$f(-x) = -f(x)$\nTeacher：What is $g(-x)$ equal to, given that $g(x)$ is even?\nStudent：$g(-x) = g(x)$\nTeacher：Then, what is $ |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| $ equal to in terms of $ f(x) $ and $ g(x) $?\nStudent：$|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |(-f(x)) \\cdot g(x)| = | -f(x) \\cdot g(x) | = | f(x) \\cdot g(x) |$\nTeacher：So, what does this tell you about the parity of $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $?\nStudent：It tells me that $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function, not an odd function.\nTeacher：Therefore, your initial choice of D was incorrect. The correct conclusion is that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function.\nStudent：Yes, I understand now.\nTeacher：Your realization that $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is even is correct. Initially, you believed it was odd—this was the error in your reasoning.\nStudent：zzc",
