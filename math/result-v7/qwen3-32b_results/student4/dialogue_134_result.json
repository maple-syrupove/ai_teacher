    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: k > 0.\nTeacher：To determine when the function is monotonically increasing, what condition must the derivative satisfy on the interval $(1, +\\infty)$?\nStudent：The derivative $f'(x)$ must satisfy $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x > 1$.\nTeacher：Good. What is the expression for $f'(x)$?\nStudent：The expression for $f'(x)$ is $k - \\frac{1}{x}$.\nTeacher：Correct. Now, for $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0$ to hold for all $x > 1$, what must be true about the minimum value of $f'(x)$ on $(1, +\\infty)$?\nStudent：The minimum value of $f'(x)$ on $(1, +\\infty)$ is when $x$ is closest to $1$, so $k - \\frac{1}{1} = k - 1$.\nTeacher：Then you require $k - 1 \\geq 0$, leading to $k \\geq 1$. Is this reasoning valid for ensuring $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x > 1$?\nStudent：Yes, I thought this was valid because if $k \\geq 1$, then $k - \\frac{1}{x}$ should always be non-negative for $x > 1$.\nTeacher：But does $k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0$ for all $x > 1$ necessarily hold if $k = 1$? Consider the behavior as $x \\to +\\infty$.\nStudent：If $k = 1$, then $f'(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{x}$. As $x \\to +\\infty$, $f'(x) \\to 1$, which is positive.\nTeacher：What is the minimum value of $f'(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{x}$ on the interval $(1, +\\infty)$?\nStudent：The minimum value is at $x=1$, so the minimum is $1-1=0$.\nTeacher：What happens to $f'(x)$ as $x$ increases from 1 to infinity? Does it ever become negative for $k = 1$?\nStudent：As $x$ increases from 1 to infinity, $f'(x)$ increases from $0$ toward $1$ and never becomes negative for $k = 1$.\nTeacher：Then why is the answer not D. $[1, +\\infty)$?\nStudent：Because when I originally solved it, I gave $k > 0$ and didn’t match the options, so I didn’t choose D.\nTeacher：Your initial reasoning for $ k \\geq 1 $ is valid. Why did you discard option D?\nStudent：Because my own answer was $k > 0$, and it didn’t match any of the given options, so I ignored D.\nTeacher：Ah, I see. Your mistake was in the initial step: you incorrectly stated your answer as $k > 0$, which is not supported by the reasoning you later provided. The correct derivation leads to $k \\geq 1$, corresponding to option D.\nStudent：zzc",
