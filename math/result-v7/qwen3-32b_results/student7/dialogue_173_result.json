    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose B. $A \\cap B=\\varnothing$.\nTeacher：Can you explain why you think A and B have no elements in common?\nStudent：Because I thought $A$ is $x<2$, and I wasn't sure what $B$ is, so I thought maybe they don't overlap and picked $\\varnothing$.\nTeacher：Can you solve the inequality defining set B: $3 - 2x > 0$?\nStudent：$3-2x>0$ can be rearranged: $-2x > -3$, so $x < 1.5$.\nTeacher：So, set B is {x | x < 1.5}. How does this relate to set A?\nStudent：Set A is {x | x < 2}, and set B is {x | x < 1.5}. So, their intersection is the set of x values that are less than both 2 and 1.5.\nTeacher：So, what is the intersection of {x | x < 2} and {x | x < 1.5}?\nStudent：The intersection is {x | x < 1.5}.\nTeacher：Then why did you choose B, which claims the intersection is empty?\nStudent：I thought at the time there wasn't an option matching {x | x < 2}, so I chose B.\nTeacher：Ah, I see. Your mistake was misinterpreting the options by thinking there was no match for your correct result {x | x < 1.5}, when in fact option A states exactly that.\nStudent：zzc",
