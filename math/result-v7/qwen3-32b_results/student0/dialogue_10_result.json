    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by directly differentiating $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^{2}+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$, but I couldn't finish the calculation and didn't get a value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you approached differentiating the function?\nStudent：I applied the quotient rule to $f(x)$: $f'(x) = \\frac{[(x^2+1)\\cdot 2(x+1) + (x^2+1)\\cos x] - [(x+1)^2 + \\sin x]\\cdot 2x}{(x^2+1)^2}$.\nTeacher：Can you verify the derivative of the numerator correctly? Specifically, check the differentiation of $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x$.\nStudent：The derivative of $(x+1)^2$ is $2(x+1)$, and the derivative of $\\sin x$ is $\\cos x$, so the derivative of the numerator is $2(x+1) + \\cos x$.\nTeacher：Your derivative of the numerator is correct. Let’s now examine the application of the quotient rule. Can you clarify how you combined the terms in the full derivative expression?\nStudent：Sure. I expanded and tried to simplify the numerator:  \n$[(x^2+1)(2(x+1)+\\cos x)] - [((x+1)^2+\\sin x)\\cdot 2x]$.  \nI attempted to combine these expressions.\nTeacher：What specific term in the numerator's expansion did you find challenging or unclear?\nStudent：I found it challenging to expand and combine all the terms especially those involving $2x(x+1)^2$ and $2x\\sin x$. The expression became very long and messy.\nTeacher：Understood. Did you consider simplifying $f(x)$ before differentiating, such as expanding $(x+1)^2$ in the numerator?\nStudent：No, I directly used the original form without expanding or simplifying $(x+1)^2$ in the numerator before differentiating.\nTeacher：Teacher：What is the expanded form of $(x+1)^2$ in the numerator?\nStudent：The expanded form is $x^2 + 2x + 1$.\nTeacher：Teacher：Now, consider how this expansion might simplify the overall function before differentiation. Did you notice any cancellation or simplification that could have been done beforehand?\nStudent：No, I didn't notice any significant simplification or cancellation before trying to differentiate.\nTeacher：Teacher：Let’s analyze the original function again. What is $f(x)$ after expanding $(x+1)^2$ in the numerator?\nStudent：After expanding, $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x + 1 + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$.\nTeacher：Teacher：Observe the numerator carefully. Can you identify a term that cancels with the denominator?\nStudent：Yes, the $x^2 + 1$ in the numerator matches the denominator, so $\\frac{x^2 + 1}{x^2 + 1} = 1$.\nTeacher：Teacher：What does this cancellation imply about the structure of $f(x)$? Can you rewrite it accordingly?\nStudent：Yes, after cancellation, $f(x) = 1 + \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$.\nTeacher：Excellent! Now consider the implications for finding $M + m$. What does this structure suggest about simplifying the problem?\nStudent：This structure suggests that instead of differentiating the complex original form, I could analyze $1+\\frac{2x+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ to more easily find the maximum and minimum values.\nTeacher：Correct. What is the derivative of this simplified function?\nStudent：The derivative is $f'(x) = \\frac{2 + \\cos x - 2x(2x + \\sin x)}{(x^2 + 1)^2}$.\nTeacher：What is the derivative of $ \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} $?\nStudent：The derivative is $\\frac{(x^2+1)\\cdot(2+\\cos x)-(2x+\\sin x)\\cdot2x}{(x^2+1)^2}$.\nTeacher：Therefore, the full derivative of $ f(x) = 1 + \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} $ should be $ f'(x) = \\frac{(x^2+1)(2+\\cos x) - (2x+\\sin x)(2x)}{(x^2+1)^2} $. Is this consistent with your earlier expression?\nStudent：No, earlier I had $f'(x) = \\frac{2 + \\cos x - 2x(2x + \\sin x)}{(x^2 + 1)^2}$, which is not fully expanded as above.\nTeacher：Your error is in omitting the $(x^2 + 1)$ factor in the numerator of the derivative.\nStudent：I see, I didn't include the $(x^2+1)$ factor when writing out the numerator in my earlier derivative expression.\nTeacher：Correct. You omitted the $(x^2 + 1)$ term when simplifying the numerator of the derivative, which led to an incorrect expression.\nStudent：No, my main error wasn't omitting the $(x^2+1)$; I had trouble simplifying before differentiating.\nTeacher：Then, what step did you find particularly difficult in simplifying $ f(x) $?\nStudent：I couldn't see that $x^2+1$ in the numerator and denominator could be canceled to rewrite $f(x)$ into a simpler form.\nTeacher：Teacher：So your main error was failing to simplify $ f(x) $ by recognizing the common term $ x^2 + 1 $ in the numerator and denominator before differentiation.\nStudent：zzc",
