Then, since we were given $\\sin2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$, I thought I could just substitute that in, so I wrote $\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=1-\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = 1-\\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$. But $\\frac{5}{9}$ wasn't in the choices, so I picked the closest, which was $\\frac{1}{2}$, or C.\nTeacher：The student incorrectly substituted $\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$ into the expression for $\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$, assuming they were equivalent when they are not related by a direct identity.\nStudent：zzc",
