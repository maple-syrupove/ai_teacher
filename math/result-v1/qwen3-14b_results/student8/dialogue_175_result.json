Why did you think this expression results in a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：Because I saw the \"i\" in the expression, and also the \"(1+i)\" term, so I thought multiplying them together would naturally give a purely imaginary number, since usually \"i\" means it's imaginary.\nTeacher：Your reasoning is based on the presence of \"i\" in the expression, but this does not guarantee the result will be purely imaginary. The error is that you did not properly evaluate the expression to determine its actual result.\nStudent：zzc",
