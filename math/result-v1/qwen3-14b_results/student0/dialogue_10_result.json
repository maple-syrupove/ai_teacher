I ended up making calculation mistakes and eventually couldn't solve for $M$ and $m$, so I couldn't give a final answer for $M+m$.\nTeacher：The student attempted to find the extrema by differentiating $ f(x) $, but they did not recognize that there is a simpler approach to solving this problem without directly computing the derivative.\nStudent：I tried differentiating $f(x)$ directly to find its maximum and minimum values, but the derivative quickly became too complicated for me to handle.
