I kind of just grabbed the whole group from -3 to 1.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student's error is that they failed to carefully interpret the inequality notation $-3 < x < 1$, which explicitly excludes the endpoints, and instead assumed the interval was inclusive.  \n\nContinuation Protocol: Were you aware that in set-builder notation like $-3 < x < 1$, the endpoints are not included?\nStudent：I know the notation but I basically just checked which numbers from N were between -3 and 1, so I ended up taking all of them from -3 to 1, including the endpoints, without really thinking whether to exclude them or not.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student's error is that they did not properly distinguish between the open interval $-3 < x < 1$ and a closed interval $-3 \\leq x \\leq 1$, and thus included the endpoints in the intersection.\nStudent：zzc",
