    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I think k > 0.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student's error is that they incorrectly assume the function is increasing based solely on the coefficient of $ x $, without considering the derivative of the function.\n\nContinuation Protocol: Why did you think that $ k > 0 $ ensures the function is monotonically increasing?\nStudent：Because if $k > 0$, then the $kx$ term increases as $x$ increases, and I thought that would make the whole function increase, since $-\\ln x$ also grows slower than $kx$. So I figured $k > 0$ should be enough.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student's error is that they failed to consider the derivative of the function and incorrectly assumed that the linear term alone determines the monotonicity of the function.\n\nContinuation Protocol: Can you explain why you think the $-\\ln x$ term grows slower than $kx$?\nStudent：Because as $x$ gets larger, $\\ln x$ increases, but much more slowly than $x$ does, so I thought the $k x$ part would always dominate and make the whole function go up if $k$ is positive.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student's error is that they incorrectly assume the dominance of the $ kx $ term over $ -\\ln x $ for all $ x > 1 $, without analyzing the derivative to determine the actual monotonicity condition.\nStudent：Because usually, when you have something like $k x - \\ln x$, if $k$ is positive, $k x$ increases faster than $\\ln x$ as $x$ gets bigger. So I figured as long as $k > 0$, the function would go up as $x$ increases.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student's error is that they incorrectly assume the function's behavior is determined by the dominant term alone, without properly analyzing the derivative to determine the monotonicity condition.\nStudent：Because in my past experience, when $k > 0$, the linear part $k x$ will outgrow the $\\ln x$ term, so I just thought $k > 0$ ensures the function always increases for $x > 1$.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student's error is that they incorrectly assume the function's monotonicity is determined solely by the dominant term $ kx $, without properly analyzing the derivative $ f'(x) $ to determine the condition for increasing behavior.\nStudent：zzc",
