I kept trying to simplify but there were too many terms to keep track of, and I wasn't sure how to proceed further to solve for the critical points.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student incorrectly assumed that directly differentiating the function would be the most efficient method, without considering alternative approaches or simplifications that could make the problem more manageable.\nStudent：zzc",
