So I didn't expand the expression, I just picked A.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student has made an error in assuming that the presence of $i$ automatically makes an expression purely imaginary, without properly evaluating the expression.\n\nContinuation Protocol: Can you explain why you believe the presence of $i$ guarantees a purely imaginary result?\nStudent：I just thought that since $i$ is the imaginary unit, and it's multiplied by $(1+i)^2$, the whole expression must be imaginary. I kind of always associate $i$ with purely imaginary numbers, so I thought it had to be right.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student has made an error in assuming that the presence of the imaginary unit $i$ in an expression automatically makes the result purely imaginary, without considering the actual computation or simplification of the expression.\nStudent：zzc",
