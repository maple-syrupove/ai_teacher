Between -3 and 1 (not including -3 and 1) AND\n2. In the set {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1}\n\nCan you explain why you chose to include 1 in your answer?\nStudent：I included 1 because I saw it was in set N and thought all numbers from -3 to 1 should be considered, so I just picked all the numbers listed in N between -3 and 1.\nTeacher：Your error is that you misunderstood the strict inequality in set M's definition, causing you to incorrectly include the endpoint 1 in the intersection.\nStudent：I thought since the interval went up to 1, I should include 1, since it's in N, and I just matched all N's numbers that seemed to be between -3 and 1.\nTeacher：Your error is that you failed to properly account for the strict inequality in set M's definition (x < 1), which excludes the endpoint 1 from being in the intersection.\nStudent：zzc",
