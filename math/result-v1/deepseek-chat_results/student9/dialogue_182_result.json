Solving the inequality, I got $x > 1$, so I chose $(1, +\\infty)$.\nTeacher：**Teacher:** Your error is that you considered the derivative's inequality without accounting for the domain of the original logarithmic function, which requires x² - 2x - 8 > 0. The function is only defined on (-∞,-2)∪(4,+∞), so the increasing interval must be a subset of these domains.\nStudent：zzc",
