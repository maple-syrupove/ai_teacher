    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the maximum and minimum by directly differentiating $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ and solving $f'(x)=0$, but the derivative became really complicated and I got stuck. So, I wasn't able to get a specific value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：Let me analyze your approach. You attempted to find the extrema by taking the derivative and setting it to zero, but encountered complexity. \n\nYour error was in not considering the function's behavior at infinity before attempting differentiation. The function's limits as x approaches ±∞ should be evaluated first to understand its overall behavior.\n\nThe mistake is: You failed to analyze the end behavior of the function before attempting to find critical points through differentiation.\nStudent：That makes sense, but I thought finding critical points by differentiation was the standard approach, so I jumped right into it. I didn't really consider looking at the function's end behavior first.\nTeacher：The mistake is: You neglected to establish the function's global behavior before attempting local analysis through differentiation.\nStudent：I see. But I thought if I just differentiate first, I could later check out what happens as $x$ goes to infinity if needed. I mostly focused on calculating the derivative but didn’t get anywhere.\nTeacher：The mistake is: You prioritized computational execution (differentiation) over strategic analysis of the function's global properties.\nStudent：I understand. I just thought differentiating the function would help me find the extrema directly, so I focused on trying to solve $f'(x)=0$, but the calculations got really messy and I couldn’t simplify the derivative enough to proceed. I didn’t try to rewrite $f(x)$ or look for a different way to simplify it.\nTeacher：The mistake is: You persisted with an overly complex differentiation approach without considering algebraic simplification or alternative methods for analyzing the function.\nStudent：zzc",
