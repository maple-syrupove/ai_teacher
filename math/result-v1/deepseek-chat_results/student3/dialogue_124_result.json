What properties of odd and even functions did you use in your analysis?\n\n[The student needs to explain their reasoning process before I can identify the specific error in their choice of D.]\nStudent：Honestly, I just thought that since f(x) is odd and g(x) is even, maybe their product, or especially the absolute value of their product, might keep the oddness in some way. So I picked D because it felt like it might work that way, but I didn't really check with the definitions.\nTeacher：Your error was in assuming that the absolute value of the product of an odd and even function would preserve oddness without verifying this against the formal definition of odd functions. \n\n[The student incorrectly applied the properties of odd and even functions to absolute value transformations without proper verification.]\nStudent：zzc",
