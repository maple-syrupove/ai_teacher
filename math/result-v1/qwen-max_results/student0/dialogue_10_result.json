    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to directly differentiate $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^{2}+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$ to find its critical points, but the derivative got very messy and I couldn’t solve for any values. So I don’t have a specific value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：It sounds like you attempted to find the maximum and minimum values by differentiating the function, but the process became too complex. Did you consider any other properties or symmetries of the function that might help simplify the problem?\nStudent：No, I didn't really try anything else. I just started with the derivative because that's what I usually do to find extrema. I thought maybe just setting $f'(x)=0$ would work, but the calculation quickly got out of hand.\nTeacher：It seems you are relying solely on the derivative to find the extrema, which can be quite complex for this function. Did you consider examining the behavior of the function at specific points or using symmetry properties?\nStudent：No, I didn't think about checking specific points or looking for symmetries. I just focused on differentiating and trying to solve from there, but since the derivative was so complicated, I got stuck and couldn’t finish.\nTeacher：You did not consider the symmetry of the function, which can simplify the process of finding the extrema. The function $f(x)$ has a certain symmetry that allows you to deduce the sum of the maximum and minimum values without explicitly solving for the critical points.\nStudent：That's true, I didn't notice any symmetry or try to use it—I just tried to compute the derivative directly since that's how I usually find extrema. I didn't realize the function could be simplified further or that symmetry would help.\nTeacher：You did not recognize the symmetry of the function, which is key to simplifying the problem. The function $f(x)$ is symmetric about the y-axis, and this symmetry can be used to deduce that $M + m = 2$.\nStudent：zzc",
