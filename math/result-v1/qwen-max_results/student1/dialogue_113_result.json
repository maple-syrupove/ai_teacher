Can you tell me which elements of N would be in the intersection based on this definition?\nStudent：Since N = { -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 }, and the interval for M is from -3 to 1, I thought all of these elements except maybe -3 and 1 would be included, but I just listed all the elements without carefully checking the strict inequalities. So my answer was { -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 }.\nTeacher：You have included -3 and 1 in the intersection, but the set M is defined with strict inequalities, which means -3 and 1 are not actually part of M.\nStudent：Oh, I see, so I should have excluded -3 and 1. I still just picked all the numbers from -3 up to 1, so I didn't really pay attention to whether they were in M based on the strict inequalities.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that -3 and 1 should be excluded from the intersection because they are not in M due to the strict inequalities. However, you also included 1 in your initial answer, which is not part of M. The error you made is including 1 in the set \\(M \\cap N\\), even though it is not in M.\nStudent：zzc",
