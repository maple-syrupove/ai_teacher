    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I don't think φ can be solved because the two functions are in different forms and can't be equated directly.\nTeacher：It's a good observation that the functions are in different forms, but we can use trigonometric identities to relate them. Let's start by considering the transformation applied to the first function. When the graph of \\( y = \\cos(2x + \\phi) \\) is shifted to the right by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) units, the new function becomes \\( y = \\cos\\left(2\\left(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\phi\\right) \\). Can you simplify this expression?\nStudent：Sure, so shifting $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ makes it $y = \\cos\\left(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi\\right) = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$. But I'm not sure what to do next since one is still a cosine and the other is a sine function.\nTeacher：You are on the right track by simplifying the expression to \\( y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) \\). The next step is to use a trigonometric identity to relate the cosine function to the sine function. Recall that \\( \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\). Applying this identity, we can write \\( \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) \\) in terms of a sine function. Can you try to express \\( \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) \\) using the sine function?\nStudent：Um… I know that $\\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, so maybe $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) = \\sin(2x - \\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\sin(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\phi)$. But even after substituting like this, it still seems different from $y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$, so I still think $\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：You have correctly used the identity to express the cosine function as a sine function, but the mistake is in not equating the arguments of the sine functions directly after transforming them. You should set the arguments \\(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\phi\\) and \\(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\) equal to each other and solve for \\(\\phi\\).\nStudent：zzc",
