    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by directly differentiating $f(x) = \\frac{(x+1)^{2} + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$ and setting $f'(x) = 0$, but the derivative turned out to be messy and complicated. I couldn't solve it fully, so I wasn't able to find specific values for $M$ and $m$, and thus couldn't compute $M + m$.\nTeacher：After reviewing your approach, I notice that you solely relied on differentiation to find the extrema, which became computationally complex. However, you did not explore functional properties that could simplify the problem. Specifically, did you examine the behavior of \\(f(x)\\) when paired with \\(f(-x)\\)? For instance, did you compute \\(f(x) + f(-x)\\) to identify any inherent symmetries or relationships? This could reveal constraints on the maximum and minimum values without solving the derivative. Please elaborate on whether you considered this or any other non-differential approaches.\nStudent：No, I didn't consider using $f(x) + f(-x)$. I thought the only way to find the extrema was to differentiate the original function and solve $f'(x) = 0$, but the calculations became too complicated and I couldn't finish. I didn't try to manipulate the structure of $f(x)$ or look for symmetries; I just attacked the problem directly with calculus.\nTeacher：Your error was that you did not recognize the symmetry property \\(f(x) + f(-x) = 2\\), which would have directly determined \\(M + m\\) without differentiation. Can you explain what led you to focus solely on differentiation and overlook the symmetry?\nStudent：I thought that for rational functions involving trigonometric terms, finding extrema always required using calculus to locate critical points, so I immediately differentiated. I didn't realize that there might be a simpler transformation or symmetry to exploit, so I didn't look for patterns like $f(x) + f(-x)$. I was mainly focused on calculation rather than restructuring the function.\nTeacher：Based on our dialogue, your error was not recognizing the symmetry property \\(f(x) + f(-x) = 2\\) that simplifies the problem. The reason for this mistake is that you assumed calculus was the only viable method for extrema problems involving rational and trigonometric functions, leading you to overlook non-differential approaches like symmetry analysis.  \n\n\\boxed{\\text{The reason for your error is that you assumed calculus was the only viable method for extrema problems involving rational and trigonometric functions, leading you to overlook non-differential approaches like symmetry analysis.}}\nStudent：zzc",
