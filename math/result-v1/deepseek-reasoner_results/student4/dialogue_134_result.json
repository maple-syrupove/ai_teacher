    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I think the answer is $k > 0$.\nTeacher：To determine the error in your reasoning, I need to understand your approach. Why do you believe that \\( k > 0 \\) is sufficient for the function \\( f(x) = kx - \\ln x \\) to be monotonically increasing on \\( (1, +\\infty) \\)?\nStudent：Because when I differentiate $f(x)$, I get $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}$. I thought that as long as $k$ is greater than $0$, $f'(x)$ will always be positive for $x > 1$, so the function will be increasing.\nTeacher：Based on your explanation, I have identified the error in your reasoning. \n\n**The error in your reasoning is that you assumed \\(k > 0\\) guarantees \\(f'(x) > 0\\) for all \\(x > 1\\), without considering that \\(k\\) must be sufficiently large to overcome the maximum value of \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) near the endpoint \\(x = 1\\).**\n\nTo further understand your thought process:  \nWhat led you to conclude that \\(k > 0\\) alone—without a specific lower bound—would ensure the derivative remains non-negative across the entire interval \\((1, +\\infty)\\), especially when \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right?\nStudent：I just saw that $\\frac{1}{x}$ gets smaller as $x$ increases, so I figured that for any $k > 0$, $k - \\frac{1}{x}$ would be greater than $0$ when $x > 1$. I didn't check what happens when $x$ is really close to $1$, I just thought positive $k$ would be enough.\nTeacher：**The error in your reasoning is that you neglected to evaluate the behavior of the derivative \\(f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}\\) as \\(x\\) approaches the lower bound \\(x = 1\\) from the right, where \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) approaches its supremum value of 1 in the interval \\((1, +\\infty)\\), leading you to assume \\(k > 0\\) was sufficient without establishing a precise lower bound.**  \n\nTo further understand your thought process:  \nWhat aspect of the concept of monotonicity or the structure of the interval \\((1, +\\infty)\\) led you to prioritize the behavior of \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) for large \\(x\\) while overlooking its behavior near \\(x = 1\\)?\nStudent：I guess I just thought about how $\\frac{1}{x}$ gets really small as $x$ gets bigger, so I focused on that and didn't really think about what happens at $x$ close to $1$. I kind of just remembered from similar problems that as long as $k$ is positive, things would work out. I didn't really check how things behave across the whole interval, just used the pattern I remembered.\nTeacher：**The error in your reasoning is that you relied on pattern recognition from prior problems without rigorously verifying the derivative's behavior across the entire interval, specifically overlooking that \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) approaches its maximum value of 1 as \\(x \\to 1^+\\), which necessitates a lower bound for \\(k\\) to ensure \\(f'(x) \\geq 0\\).**  \n\nTo further understand your thought process:  \nHow did the structure of the interval \\((1, +\\infty)\\)—being open and unbounded—contribute to your initial focus on large \\(x\\) while neglecting the endpoint behavior, despite knowing that monotonicity requires the derivative to hold for all points in the domain?\nStudent：zzc",
