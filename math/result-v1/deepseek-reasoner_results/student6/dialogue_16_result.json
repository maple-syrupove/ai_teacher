    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I don’t know how to solve for $\\phi$ because the two functions are different types—one is cosine and the other is sine—so I think $\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：Based on the student's statement, the core issue is their assumption about the incomparability of cosine and sine functions. To probe further without guiding toward the solution, I ask:\n\n**Teacher**: You mentioned that the functions being different types makes solving for φ impossible. Can you elaborate on why you believe cosine and sine cannot be related in this context?  \n\n*(Awaiting student response. The conversation will continue until the error is confirmed or \"zzc\" is received.)*\nStudent：Well, I thought since cosine and sine are fundamentally different functions, there's not a straightforward way to set their expressions equal to each other directly. Because of that, I didn't see a way to find φ where the shifted cosine function could match the sine function, so I believed it's not solvable for φ.\nTeacher：Based on your elaboration, the core issue remains your assumption about the incomparability of cosine and sine. You stated that the difference in function types prevents setting their expressions equal, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of trigonometric relationships.  \n\n**Teacher**: Your error is assuming that the cosine and sine functions cannot be related or compared through trigonometric identities due to their perceived fundamental differences.  \n\nCan you explain what specific aspect of trigonometric identities led you to overlook their applicability here?  \n\n*(Awaiting your response. The conversation will continue until your error is fully confirmed or you respond with \"zzc\".)*\nStudent：I didn't really think about using any identities, because I was just looking at the cosine and sine as separate functions. I didn't remember that there are formulas that could convert between them, so I didn't try to apply any. I just kept them as they were and thought it couldn't be solved.\nTeacher：Based on your latest response, you explicitly stated that you did not consider trigonometric identities because you viewed cosine and sine as inherently separate and did not recall the relevant conversion formulas. This confirms the core misunderstanding.  \n\n**Teacher**: Your error is failing to recognize that trigonometric identities, such as the co-function relationship between sine and cosine, are essential tools for transforming and comparing these functions in phase-shift problems.  \n\nTo probe further under the continuation protocol: What specific misconception or gap in your understanding led you to overlook the universal applicability of trigonometric identities in relating sine and cosine?  \n\n*(Awaiting your response.
