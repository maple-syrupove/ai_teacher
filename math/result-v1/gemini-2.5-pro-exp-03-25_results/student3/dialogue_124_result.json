    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Hello. Thank you for providing your answer. Could you please walk me through your thought process?\nStudent：Honestly, I kind of just looked at the options and thought about the properties of odd and even functions, but I didn't really go step-by-step. D seemed reasonable to me because I thought multiplying or taking the absolute value wouldn't change the \"oddness\" if one of the functions is odd.\nTeacher：Thank you for sharing your reasoning. You mentioned a key idea: you thought that taking the absolute value wouldn't change the \"oddness\" of the function.\n\nLet's test that specific idea. Can you give me an example of a very simple odd function?\nStudent：Sure, a simple odd function is $f(x) = x$.\nTeacher：Teacher：Excellent, `f(x) = x` is a perfect example of an odd function. Now, let's look at `|f(x)|`. What does the function `|f(x)|` become in this case? And is this new function, `|x|`, odd or even?\nStudent：So, if $f(x) = x$, then $|f(x)| = |x|$, and $|x|$ is an even function, not an odd function.\nTeacher：You have incorrectly assumed that taking the absolute value of an odd function results in another odd function.\nStudent：You're right, I see now that was an incorrect assumption. I guess I just went with my gut and didn't actually check each option using the substitution like $f(-x)$ or $g(-x)$.\nTeacher：That's a very important realization. Relying on formal definitions is a crucial skill. Can you tell me what would have happened if you had applied that substitution test to your chosen answer, Option D?\nStudent：If I had applied the substitution test to Option D, I would have calculated $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$ and compared it to $-|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ to check if the function was really odd. But I didn't actually do that—I just picked what seemed right.\nTeacher：That is precisely the correct method to use. So, please go ahead and perform that substitution now. What do you get when you simplify $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$ using the given properties of f(x) and g(x)?\nStudent：Okay, let's do the substitution:\n\nSince $f(x)$ is odd, $f(-x) = -f(x)$.\nSince $g(x)$ is even, $g(-x) = g(x)$.\n\nSo,\n$$|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |(-f(x)) \\cdot g(x)| = |-f(x)g(x)| = |f(x)g(x)|.$$\n\nSo $|f(-x)g(-x)| = |f(x)g(x)|$.\n\nThat means $|f(x)g(x)|$ is an even function, not an odd function. This means my choice D was incorrect, and I can see why now. I should have checked each option this way instead of just guessing.\nTeacher：You did not verify your choice by applying the formal definitions of odd and even functions.\nStudent：zzc",
