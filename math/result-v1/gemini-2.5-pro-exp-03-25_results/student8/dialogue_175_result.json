    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $i(1+i)^2$\nTeacher：Hello! I see you chose option A. Could you please explain to me how you arrived at that answer?\nStudent：I noticed that the expression involves $i$ and $(1+i)$, and since $i$ is the imaginary unit, I thought multiplying expressions with $i$ generally results in a purely imaginary number. So I just picked option A.\nTeacher：I understand your reasoning. You've formed a general rule that multiplying by $i$ results in a purely imaginary number. To test that rule, what do you get when you multiply $i$ by another $i$?\nStudent：When you multiply $i$ by another $i$, you get $i^2$, which is $-1$. That's a real number, not an imaginary number.\nTeacher：That's exactly right. So your initial rule doesn't always hold true. Knowing that, can you walk me through the steps you took to simplify option A, which is $i(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：I actually didn't work out the calculation for $i(1+i)^2$. I just assumed it would be purely imaginary since $i$ is present in the expression, so I didn't expand or verify it.\nTeacher：You did not simplify the expression to determine its final form.\nStudent：zzc",
