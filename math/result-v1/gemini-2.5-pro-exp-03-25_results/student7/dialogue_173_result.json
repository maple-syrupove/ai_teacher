    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. $A \\cap B=\\varnothing$\nTeacher：Hello, thank you for submitting your answer. Could you please explain how you determined the elements of set B?\nStudent：I saw B as the set of all x such that 3 - 2x > 0, but I didn't really work it out. I just thought of B as another set with its own condition.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. Since you didn't solve for the values of x in set B, what led you to believe that set A and set B have no elements in common?\nStudent：I thought that since A is all x less than 2, and B seemed like it might have different values, I just assumed their overlap might be empty. When I tried to take the intersection, I took the “similar part” as x < 2 and wrote A∩B = {x | x < 2}, but since that wasn't an option, I chose B, the empty set.\nTeacher：You did not solve the inequality $3-2x>0$ to determine the elements of set B before attempting to find the intersection.\nStudent：zzc",
