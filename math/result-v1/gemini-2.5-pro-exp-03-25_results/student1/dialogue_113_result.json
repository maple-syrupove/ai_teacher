    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A. $\\{-2,-1,0,1\\}$.\nTeacher：Hello! Thank you for sharing your answer with me. Could you please walk me through your thinking process? How did you decide on the elements for the intersection?\nStudent：I looked at the interval given for set M, which is from -3 to 1, and I thought that included -3, -2, -1, 0, and 1. Then I checked which elements from set N fall within this interval and wrote down all of them: -3, -2, -1, 0, and 1. Since option A matches most of those, I picked it.\nTeacher：Thank you for that detailed explanation. It helps me understand your approach. Let's look closely at the definition of set M: $M=\\{x \\mid-3<x<1, x \\in R\\}$. What does the symbol '<' specifically mean in this context? For example, what does $x<1$ tell you about the number 1?\nStudent：It means that x can be any number less than 1, so I thought 1 could be included because it's right at the end of the interval.\nTeacher：You have misinterpreted the meaning of the strict inequality symbol '<', as it signifies that the endpoint itself is not included in the set.\nStudent：zzc",
