But since they looked different, I didn't see a way to set up an equation between them.\nTeacher：You are right, they are written differently. Do you know of any trigonometric identities that could be used to write a sine function in terms of a cosine function?\nStudent：I know that sine and cosine are related, but I didn't try to use any identities to change one into the other.
