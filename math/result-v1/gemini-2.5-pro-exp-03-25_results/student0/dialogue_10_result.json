    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the maximum and minimum of $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ by differentiating it directly, but the derivative was too complicated and I got lost in the calculations. I couldn't find the specific values for $M$ and $m$, so I wasn't able to provide an answer for $M+m$.\nTeacher：I can certainly see why you found the derivative to be complicated. That approach involves a lot of steps. Could you tell me why you believe it was necessary to find the specific values of M and m to solve for their sum?\nStudent：Because the problem asks for $M+m$, the sum of the maximum and minimum values of $f(x)$, I thought I needed to first explicitly compute both $M$ and $m$ individually using calculus, so I started by trying to find the critical points with the derivative.\nTeacher：I see. It's a very logical deduction that to find the sum of two values, you would need to find the values themselves first. Before applying that calculus-based method, did you try to algebraically manipulate or simplify the expression for $f(x)$ to see if it revealed any helpful properties?\nStudent：No, I didn't try to transform or simplify the expression before differentiating. I just used the definition of $f(x)$ as given and immediately started to compute the derivative.\nTeacher：You did not simplify the function $f(x)$ by algebraic manipulation before applying calculus, which prevented you from observing a key property of the function.\nStudent：zzc",
