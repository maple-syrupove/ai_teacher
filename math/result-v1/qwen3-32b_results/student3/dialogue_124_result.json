You said D is correct, meaning that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function. Is there a reason you believe this is the case?\nStudent：I just felt that multiplying an odd function by an even function might keep some of the properties of an odd function, and then taking the absolute value shouldn't affect the oddness, so I thought D was correct.\nTeacher：Teacher: Your reasoning is based on intuition rather than a precise understanding of function properties. The error in your reasoning is that the absolute value of an odd function does not preserve its oddness; instead, it makes the function even.\nStudent：zzc",
