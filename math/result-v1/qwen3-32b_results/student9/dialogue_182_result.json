I took the derivative: $f'(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 2x - 8} \\cdot (2x - 2) = \\frac{2(x-1)}{x^2 - 2x - 8}$. Then I set $f'(x) > 0$, which means $\\frac{2(x-1)}{x^2 - 2x - 8} > 0$. This is true when $x>1$, so I picked $(1, +\\infty)$.\nTeacher：Teacher: Your mistake is that you did not consider the domain of the original function $f(x) = \\ln(x^2 - 2x - 8)$, which requires the argument of the logarithm to be positive. Therefore, the interval must satisfy both $x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0$ and the condition derived from the derivative $f'(x) > 0$.\nStudent：zzc",
