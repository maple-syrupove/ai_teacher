    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A. $\\{-2,-1,0,1\\}$.\nTeacher：Teacher: Let me check your answer. Could you explain how you arrived at the conclusion that $ M \\cap N = \\{-2,-1,0,1\\} $?\nStudent：I looked at the definition of $M$ as $-3 < x < 1$ and saw that N is $\\{-3,-2,-1,0,1\\}$. I thought that since $-2, -1, 0, 1$ are all in the interval from $-3$ up to $1$, I just picked all of them from $N$. So I wrote $M \\cap N = \\{-2,-1,0,1\\}$.\nTeacher：Teacher: The error in your reasoning is that the value $1$ is not included in the set $M$, as $M$ is defined by the strict inequality $-3 < x < 1$. Therefore, $1$ should not be included in the intersection.\nStudent：Oh, I see. So should I have just not included $1$ because it's not strictly between $-3$ and $1$? That makes sense. But doesn't $-3$ also count since that's where the interval starts?\nTeacher：The error in your reasoning is that you incorrectly considered the boundary point $-3$ for inclusion, while failing to recognize that both $-3$ and $1$ are excluded from set $M$ due to the strict inequality.\nStudent：zzc",
