    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is A. I chose $\\{-2,-1,0,1\\}$.\nTeacher：Why did you include 1 in your answer? Is 1 included in the set M?\nStudent：I included 1 because it was in set N, but now that you mention it, set M is defined as $-3 < x < 1$, so 1 is not actually included in M.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that 1 is not in set M because M requires $x < 1$. However, you initially included 1 in your answer. Now that you see 1 is excluded from M, why did you originally overlook the strict inequality? Does that affect your final choice?\nStudent：I overlooked the strict inequality because I didn't carefully analyze the definition of set M at first—I just checked which elements from N seemed to fall within the interval, without considering if -3 or 1 were actually excluded. Removing 1 from my answer, the intersection should be $\\{-2,-1,0\\}$.\nTeacher：You correctly removed 1 from the intersection because 1 is not in M. However, you did not reconsider whether -3 should be included. Is -3 in M? Recall that M is defined by $-3 < x < 1$, so -3 is excluded. Why then did you not exclude -3 from your answer?\nStudent：I didn't exclude -3 because I just looked at all values from -3 to 1 in N without double-checking which were strictly inside the interval, so I should have left out -3 as well.\nTeacher：You correctly realized that both -3 and 1 are excluded from M due to the strict inequalities. Since neither -3 nor 1 is in M, they cannot be in the intersection. Your initial answer included 1, and even after correction, you did not explicitly remove -3. Therefore, your mistake was including elements from N without verifying that they satisfy *both* the condition of M and membership in N. Specifically, you failed to recognize that -3 ∉ M, so -3 ∉ M ∩ N.\nStudent：zzc",
