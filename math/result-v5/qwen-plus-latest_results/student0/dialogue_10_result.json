    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was: I couldn't find the exact value of $M+m$ because I got stuck differentiating $f(x)$ and calculating the critical points.\nTeacher：You don't need to compute the derivative to find $ M + m $. Think about the symmetry of the function—specifically, consider $ f(-x) $ and how it relates to $ f(x) $. What can you conclude about $ f(x) + f(-x) $?\nStudent：I see that $f(-x) = \\frac{((-x)+1)^2+\\sin(-x)}{(-x)^2+1}$, so $f(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1} + \\frac{(1-x)^2-\\sin x}{x^2+1}$. Combining these, I find $f(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2}{x^2+1}$.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified $ f(x) + f(-x) $ to $ \\frac{(x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2}{x^2+1} $. Now simplify the numerator and denominator. What do you notice about the resulting expression? Is it constant?\nStudent：The numerator simplifies to $2(x^2+1)$, so $f(x)+f(-x) = \\frac{2(x^2+1)}{x^2+1} = 2$, which is constant.\nTeacher：You correctly found that $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $. Since this sum is constant for all $ x $, the function is symmetric in a way that ensures the maximum and minimum values are symmetric about 1. Therefore, $ M + m = 2 $.  \n\nYour mistake was not in the calculation, but in not recognizing that this constant sum directly gives $ M + m $ without needing to find $ M $ or $ m $ individually.\nStudent：zzc",
