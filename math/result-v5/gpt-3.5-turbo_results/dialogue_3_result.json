    "history_prompt": "\n学生：I chose D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\n教师：Can you explain to me why you believe that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function based on the given information about the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)?\n学生：I thought that since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, their combination in the form $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ might preserve oddness, but I didn't verify it formally.\n教师：Based on your explanation, it seems you are attempting to combine properties of odd and even functions. Can you identify how the properties of odd and even functions behave in terms of multiplication to help determine the nature of the resulting function $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$?\n学生：If you multiply an odd function $f(x)$ by an even function $g(x)$, the result $f(x)\\cdot g(x)$ is an odd function. However, taking the absolute value $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ can change the parity, so I should have checked $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)|$ directly.\n教师：What is the parity of the function $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ when considering how odd and even functions combine under multiplication?\n学生：When multiplying an odd function by an even function, $f(x)\\cdot g(x)$ is odd because $f(-x)\\cdot g(-x) = -f(x)\\cdot g(x)$.\n教师：Based on your explanation, what conclusion can you draw regarding the parity of the function $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$?\n学生：$|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ will be an even function, because the absolute value eliminates the sign, so $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$.\n教师：You have correctly identified the properties of odd and even functions under multiplication. However, your conclusion about the parity of $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is not accurate. Can you reconsider how the absolute value impacts the parity of a function?\n学生：The absolute value makes all outputs non-negative, so for any $x$, $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$. This means $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is actually an even function.\n教师：Correct! You have demonstrated a solid understanding of the impact of absolute value on the parity of a function. Based on your final clarification, what conclusion can you draw about the parity of $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$?\n学生：The function $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function.\n教师：You have successfully corrected your mistake. Well done!\n学生：I chose D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\n教师：What specific property of odd and even functions affects the parity of the function when you take the absolute value of their product $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$?\n学生：The specific property is that taking the absolute value removes the sign, making $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ even, regardless of the original function’s parity.\n教师：Exactly, the absolute value removes the sign, making $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ even, regardless of the original functions' parity. Great job!\n学生：Thank you, teacher! I understand now that the absolute value makes the function even, not odd.\n教师：Great job understanding the impact of the absolute value on the parity of functions! Keep up the good work in analyzing properties of functions.\n学生：I chose D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\n教师：You have made progress in understanding the impact of the absolute value, but your choice of D is still incorrect. Can you now identify the correct conclusion about the parity of $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ based on our discussion?\n学生：Based on our discussion, $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is actually an even function, not an odd function.\n教师：You have identified the correct conclusion that $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is actually an even function. Well done!\n学生：I chose D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\n教师：Based on our discussion, what can you now conclude about the parity of the function $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$?\n学生：I now conclude that $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function, not an odd function.\n教师：You have successfully identified that $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function, not an odd function. Great job understanding the properties of odd and even functions under multiplication and absolute value!\n学生：I chose D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function. The correct conclusion is that $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is actually an even function.\n教师：You have accurately identified that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is actually an even function, not an odd function as you initially thought. Well done in understanding the impact of absolute value on the parity of functions!\n学生：I chose D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function. The absolute value makes the result always non-negative, so it becomes even.\n教师：You've shown a clear understanding that $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ results in a non-negative function, but can you identify how being non-negative relates to the function's parity status?\n学生：Being non-negative doesn’t determine parity; parity depends on whether $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$. Since this holds, it is even.\n教师：What you've explained about non-negativity and parity is correct. So, is $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ true for all $x$?\n学生：Yes, $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is true for all $x$.\n教师：Your understanding is commendable. Since $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ holds for all $x$, what can you conclude about the parity of $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$?\n学生：I can conclude that $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function.\n教师：You've accurately concluded that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function. However, your choice of D asserting it is odd reflects a misunderstanding. The function's absolute value ensures it cannot be odd.\n学生：Yes, I understand now—the absolute value makes $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ even, not odd, so D is incorrect.\n教师：You have successfully recognized the mistake in your answer choice. Well done for understanding how the absolute value affects the parity of a function!",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: The teacher correctly identified the student's error, which was a failure to apply the standard method for analyzing parity by directly substituting into the function definitions. The dialogue ultimately led the student to understand that the absolute value function is even, not odd, as they initially thought. Rating: 2.\n\nSocratic Method: The teacher effectively guided the student through questioning, helping them reconsider their understanding of odd and even functions and the impact of absolute value without directly pointing out the error. The student was led to correct their misconception through a series of questions that encouraged reflection and analysis. Rating: 2.\n\nAdherence to Rules: The teacher maintained a professional tone throughout the dialogue and adhered to the constraints by not providing full solutions or directly pointing out the error. The questioning was aligned with Socratic principles, focusing on guiding the student to self-discovery. Rating: 2.\n\nFinal Rating: 2 = Excellent.",
