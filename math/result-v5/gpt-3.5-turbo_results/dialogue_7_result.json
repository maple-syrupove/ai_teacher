    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer was B, that is, $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$.\n教师：Let's analyze your choice. Can you explain why you believe that the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$ is empty?\n学生：Because I thought A is all $x<2$, and I directly interpreted the intersection as \"similar parts,\" so I tried to find overlap, but didn't see a matching answer, so I chose $\\varnothing$.\n教师：I see. Can you clarify what the set $B$ represents in this context and how it relates to the set $A$ when considering their intersection?\n学生：Set $B$ is defined by $3-2x>0$. I didn’t convert that inequality; I just considered $A$ as $x<2$ and didn’t further compare or find a strict overlap.\n教师：Your explanation is clear. Now, can you see where the misconception might be in how you interpreted the inequality $3-2x>0$ for set $B\" and its intersection with set $A$?\n学生：I didn't actually solve $3-2x>0$ for $x$. If I had, I would have found the correct range for $B$ and then could compare it properly with $A$ to determine their intersection.\n教师：You have identified the lack of solving the inequality for set \\( B \\) as a key issue. The mistake lies in not determining the correct range for \\( B \\). Can you confirm if this is the realization you reached?\n学生：Yes, that's right—I didn't determine the correct range for $B$ before trying to find the intersection.\n教师：Your mistake is that you did not solve the inequality \\(3-2x>0\\) for set \\(B\\). Without identifying the correct range for \\(B\\), you couldn't properly assess the intersection with set \\(A\\).\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: The teacher accurately identified the student's error related to the strategic dimension. They pinpointed the student's failure to convert the inequality \\(3-2x>0\\) for set \\(B\\), which led to the incorrect interpretation of the intersection as empty. This aligns with the specific error point described in the error JSON. Rating: 2.\n\nSocratic Method: The teacher effectively used Socratic questioning to guide the student towards recognizing their mistake. By asking probing questions about the interpretation of set \\(B\\) and the process of finding the intersection, the teacher helped the student realize the need to solve the inequality. Rating: 2.\n\nAdherence to Rules: The teacher adhered to the constraints by maintaining a professional tone, avoiding direct hints, and refraining from providing full solutions. The dialogue was conducted in a manner consistent with the Socratic method. Rating: 2.\n\nFinal Rating: 2 = Excellent.",
