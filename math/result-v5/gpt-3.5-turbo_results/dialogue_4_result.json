    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer was: D. $[1,+\\infty)$.\n教师：Your answer is incorrect. Can you explain your reasoning behind choosing $[1,+\\infty)$ as the range of values for $k$ in order for the function to be monotonically increasing on the interval $(1, +\\infty)$?\n学生：I saw $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}$ and thought to keep $f'(x) \\geq 0$, $k$ must be at least $1$, so I chose $[1, +\\infty)$.\n教师：What conditions must be met for the derivative \\( f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x} \\) to be non-negative for all \\( x > 1 \\)? Consider what happens as \\( x \\) approaches \\( 1 \\).\n学生：As $x$ approaches $1$ from the right, $\\frac{1}{x}$ approaches $1$, so $f'(x)$ becomes $k - 1$. For $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x > 1$, $k$ needs to be at least $1$.\n教师：Consider the condition \\( f'(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x > 1 \\). What happens if \\( k = 1 \\) at \\( x = 1 \\)? Does it ensure \\( f'(x) \\) remains non-negative for all \\( x > 1 \\)?\n学生：If $k = 1$, then $f'(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{x}$. For $x > 1$, $\\frac{1}{x} < 1$, so $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x > 1$. So yes, it remains non-negative.\n教师：What does the derivative \\( f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x} \\) imply about \\( k \\) as \\( x \\) increases beyond \\( 1 \\)? Does it limit \\( k \\) to just at least \\( 1 \\), or could another value for \\( k \\) also keep \\( f'(x) \\) non-negative?\n学生：As $x$ increases beyond $1$, $\\frac{1}{x}$ gets smaller, so for any $k \\geq 1$, $f'(x)$ stays positive. If $k$ is less than $1$, at $x$ close to $1$, $f'(x)$ would be negative. So I thought only $k \\geq 1$ works.\n教师：Your conclusion that \\( k \\geq 1 \\) ensures \\( f'(x) \\geq 0 \\) is correct; however, you overlooked considering values of \\( k \\) greater than \\( 1 \\). What implication does that have for the function's behavior in that interval? \n学生：If $k > 1$, then $f'(x)$ is always positive for $x > 1$, so the function is strictly increasing in that interval.\n教师：Your analysis is on the right track. However, in the context of a monotonically increasing function, what does it mean if the derivative is always positive on the interval $(1, +\\infty)$ for $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}$ and $k > 1$?\n学生：If $k > 1$, then $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x > 1$, so the function is strictly increasing on $(1, +\\infty)$.\n教师：Your final statement is correct. The mistake in your initial answer selection has been addressed. Well done.\n学生：Thank you, teacher. I understand now that $k > 1$ ensures $f'(x) > 0$ throughout $(1, +\\infty)$, making the function strictly increasing.\n教师：Great job in understanding the concept! Your recognition that $k > 1$ ensures $f'(x) > 0$ throughout the interval $(1, +\\infty)$ is spot on. Keep up the good work!\n学生：Thank you! I'll be more careful with parameter discussions and pay attention to the full interval next time.\n教师：Great job on understanding the concept! I'm glad you now see that $k > 1$ guarantees $f'(x) > 0$ throughout the interval $(1, +\\infty)$. Keep up the good work!\n学生：Thank you! I'll keep an eye out for patterns and interval requirements more carefully in future problems.\n教师：Great to see your improved understanding! If you have any more questions or need further clarification in the future, feel free to ask. Keep up the good work and continue paying attention to details in parameter discussions and interval considerations.\n学生：Thank you! I'll stay mindful of those details from now on.\n教师：Your error lies in choosing \\( k \\) only from the range \\( [1, +\\infty) \\). While you considered \\( k = 1 \\) as a boundary, you did not address the full range of values in the context of maintaining the derivative's positivity across the interval.\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: The teacher correctly identified the student's error. The student initially failed to consider the full range of values for \\( k \\) that would ensure the derivative \\( f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x} \\) remains non-negative for all \\( x > 1 \\). The teacher guided the student to understand that \\( k > 1 \\) ensures the function is strictly increasing, addressing the student's pattern recognition failure. Rating: 2.\n\nSocratic Method: The teacher effectively used Socratic questioning to guide the student without directly providing answers. The questions prompted the student to reconsider their assumptions about the relationship between \\( k \\) and \\( x \\) and explore the implications of different values for \\( k \\). Rating: 2.\n\nAdherence to Rules: The teacher maintained a professional tone throughout the conversation and adhered to the constraints by not providing full solutions. The interaction was focused on leading the student to discover the error themselves through questioning. Rating: 2.\n\nFinal Rating: 2 (Excellent)",
