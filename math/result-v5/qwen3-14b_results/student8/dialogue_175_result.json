    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Let me ask: Did you simplify $(1+i)^2$ correctly?\nStudent：Honestly, I didn't actually expand $(1+i)^2$; I just assumed it would give a purely imaginary result.\nTeacher：Your assumption is incorrect. Let me ask: What is the correct expansion of $(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：The correct expansion is $(1+i)^2 = 1^2 + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot i + (i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$.\nTeacher：You correctly expanded $(1+i)^2$ as $2i$. Let me ask: What is the result of multiplying this by $i$?\nStudent：Multiplying $2i$ by $i$ gives $2i^2$, which equals $2(-1) = -2$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $i(1+i)^2 = -2$, which is a real number, not purely imaginary. Let me ask: Did you check the other options?\nStudent：No, I didn't check the other options; I chose A based on its appearance without verifying the rest.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed option A would yield a purely imaginary number without verifying. Let me ask: Did you analyze the other options to find the correct answer?\nStudent：No, I didn’t analyze the other options; I only relied on the appearance of option A.\nTeacher：You made the mistake of selecting an option based on appearance rather than calculation. Let me ask: What is the result of option B, $i^2(1-i)$?\nStudent：Option B: $i^2(1-i) = (-1)(1-i) = -1 + i$. This is not purely imaginary; it has a real part.\nTeacher：You correctly evaluated option B as $-1 + i$, which is not purely imaginary. Let me ask: What is the result of option C, $(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：Option C: $(1+i)^2 = 2i$, which is a purely imaginary number since the real part is 0.\nTeacher：You correctly evaluated option C as $2i$, which is purely imaginary. Let me ask: What is the result of option D, $i(1+i)$?\nStudent：Option D: $i(1+i) = i + i^2 = i - 1$, which is not purely imaginary because it has a real part.\nTeacher：You correctly evaluated option C as $2i$, which is purely imaginary. Therefore, the correct answer is option C. Please confirm with \"zzc.\"\nStudent：zzc",
