    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：What is the definition of an odd function?\nStudent：An odd function satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：What is the definition of an even function?\nStudent：An even function satisfies $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：What is the definition of an odd function?\nStudent：An odd function must satisfy $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for every $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：What is the definition of an even function?\nStudent：An even function satisfies $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：What is the property of $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ when you replace $x$ with $-x$?\nStudent：If I replace $x$ with $-x$, I get $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)|$. Since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, $f(-x)=-f(x)$, $g(-x)=g(x)$. So it is $|{-f(x)}\\cdot g(x)|=|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：You concluded that $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$. What does this imply about the parity of $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$?\nStudent：This implies that $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function, not an odd function.\nTeacher：You concluded that $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function, not an odd function. This contradicts your initial choice of D. What was the reasoning behind your initial choice?\nStudent：I chose D based on intuition. I saw the absolute value and product and thought it would be odd, but I didn't check with the function definitions directly.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is odd without verifying it with definitions. What property must hold for a function to be odd?\nStudent：For a function to be odd, it must satisfy $h(-x) = -h(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the condition for an odd function. However, your earlier conclusion that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is odd was incorrect. What did you find when you evaluated $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$?\nStudent：I found that $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)|=|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$, which means the function is even.\nTeacher：You correctly found that $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$, which implies the function is even, not odd. Your initial choice of D was incorrect. What was your reasoning for choosing D initially?\nStudent：I didn’t carefully substitute $-x$ into each option. I relied on intuition and didn’t analyze the function definitions step-by-step.\nTeacher：You initially chose D because you relied on intuition rather than verifying the function's behavior under $-x$. This led you to incorrectly assume $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is odd. What did your analysis show?\nStudent：My analysis showed that $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is actually an even function, not an odd function as I first thought.\nTeacher：Your analysis correctly shows that $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function. This means option D is incorrect. What was your reasoning for the other options?\nStudent：For the other options, I didn't substitute $-x$ into each expression to test their parity. I mainly tried to guess based on their appearance.\nTeacher：You didn’t analyze the other options by substituting $-x$. What is the parity of $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$?\nStudent：If I substitute $-x$, I get $f(-x)\\cdot g(-x) = [-f(x)]\\cdot g(x) = -f(x)\\cdot g(x)$. So $f(x)\\cdot g(x)$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：You correctly found that $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ is odd. What does this imply about option A, which claims $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ is even?\nStudent：Option A is incorrect, because $f(x)\\cdot g(x)$ is actually an odd function, not even.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ is odd, not even. This means option A is incorrect. What about option C: $f(x) \\cdot |g(x)|$? What would happen if you substitute $-x$ into this expression?\nStudent：If I substitute $-x$, it becomes $f(-x) \\cdot |g(-x)| = -f(x) \\cdot |g(x)| = -[f(x) \\cdot |g(x)|]$. That means $f(x)\\cdot|g(x)|$ is odd.\nTeacher：You correctly determined that $f(x) \\cdot |g(x)|$ is odd. What about option B: $|f(x)| \\cdot g(x)$? What happens when you substitute $-x$ into this expression?\nStudent：If I substitute $-x$, it becomes $|f(-x)| \\cdot g(-x) = |{-f(x)}| \\cdot g(x) = |f(x)| \\cdot g(x)$. So it's even.\nTeacher：You correctly found that $|f(x)| \\cdot g(x)$ is even. This means option B is incorrect. What about option C, which claims $f(x) \\cdot |g(x)|$ is odd? Did you analyze it correctly?\nStudent：Yes, I analyzed it correctly: $f(x)\\cdot|g(x)|$ is odd because substituting $-x$ gives $- [f(x)\\cdot|g(x)|]$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that option C is correct. Your initial choice of D was incorrect because you misjudged the parity of $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$. Please confirm with \"zzc.\"\nStudent：zzc",
