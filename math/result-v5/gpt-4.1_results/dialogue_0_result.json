    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer is: I was unable to find a specific value for $M + m$ because my calculation for the extrema was too complex and I had to stop.\n教师：Could you explain the approach you used to find the extrema? What was the first step you took in analyzing $f(x)$?\n学生：My first step was to directly differentiate the given function $f(x)$ in order to find its critical points for the extrema.\n教师：When you differentiated $f(x)$, did you apply the quotient rule correctly and fully simplify both the numerator and denominator?\n学生：I applied the quotient rule to differentiate $f(x)$, but I struggled to fully simplify the resulting expression, and the calculation became quite cumbersome.\n教师：It seems your difficulty arose during the simplification after differentiation, rather than a misapplication of the quotient rule itself.\n学生：Yes, that's correct. My main difficulty was with the simplification process after differentiating; the expression became very complicated, and I couldn't proceed further.\n教师：Your main error was stopping at the simplification step due to its apparent complexity, rather than seeking alternative approaches or further simplification techniques to analyze the extrema.\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: The teacher correctly identified the student's error as strategic, specifically the inability to transform the problem into a simpler structure. The dialogue shows the student struggled with simplifying the expression after differentiation, which aligns with the error of not transforming the function to make it more manageable. The teacher pinpointed the student's stopping point due to complexity, which is accurate.\n\nSocratic Method: The teacher used effective questioning to guide the student to reflect on their process, asking about the initial step and probing the student's application of differentiation and simplification. The teacher did not directly provide solutions or hints, maintaining the Socratic method.\n\nAdherence to Rules: The teacher adhered to the constraints, maintaining a professional tone and not providing full solutions or direct answers. The dialogue followed the guidelines effectively.\n\nFinal Rating: 2 = Excellent",
