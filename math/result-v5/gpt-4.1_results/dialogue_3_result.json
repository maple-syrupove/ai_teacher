    "history_prompt": "\n学生：I chose option D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\n教师：Your mistake is in assuming that taking the absolute value of a product of functions preserves the oddness property.\n学生：I don't think that was my main mistake. I chose D because it \"felt\" like it could be odd, but I didn't check using substitution.\n教师：Thank you for clarifying.

    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: The teacher accurately identified the student's error as failing to verify the definition of oddness using substitution. However, the teacher did not fully address the strategic error of not using the standard problem-solving strategy for parity problems. Rating: 1\n\nSocratic Method: The teacher did not employ effective Socratic questioning. The teacher directly pointed out the error rather than guiding the student to discover it through questioning.
