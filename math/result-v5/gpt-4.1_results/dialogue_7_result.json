These two sets are not necessarily disjoint.\n学生：I see. I thought their intersection would be empty because I didn't process set B's inequality further.\n教师：It appears your mistake was not simplifying the inequality for set B before comparing it with set A.\n学生：You're right. I didn't solve $3-2x>0$ to find the actual range for set B.\n教师：Exactly—your error was not solving $3-2x>0$ to determine the elements of set B before attempting the intersection.\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: The teacher correctly identified the student's error, which was the failure to simplify the inequality for set B before attempting to find the intersection with set A. The teacher pinpointed the student's strategic error in not transforming the problem effectively. Rating: 2.\n\nSocratic Method: The teacher guided the student through effective questioning by prompting the student to realize the need to process the inequality for set B further. The dialogue encouraged the student to reflect on their process without direct hints or answers. Rating: 2.\n\nAdherence to Rules: The teacher maintained a professional tone and adhered to the constraints by not providing a full solution and focusing on guiding the student through questioning. Rating: 2.\n\nFinal Rating: 2 = Excellent.",
