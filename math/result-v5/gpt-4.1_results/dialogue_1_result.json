Do you notice which elements in your answer do not actually satisfy this strict inequality?\n学生：Yes, according to $-3 < x < 1$, $-3$ and $1$ do not satisfy the inequality, so they shouldn't be included.\n教师：That is correct. Including $-3$ and $1$ is the specific mistake in your previous answer, as they do not satisfy $-3 < x < 1$.\n学生：zzc",

The teacher correctly pointed out the mistake in selecting the elements of the intersection. Rating: 2.\n\nSocratic Method: The teacher employed effective questioning by asking the student to reconsider the elements that do not satisfy the inequality, allowing the student to identify their mistake without direct hints or solutions.
