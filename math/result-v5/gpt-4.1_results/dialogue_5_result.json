    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer is A. I thought there were 3 combinations, so I picked 3/10.\n教师：You seem to have assumed that there are 3 valid combinations of numbers that form a Pythagorean triple from $1$ to $5$. Are you certain that all three of those combinations actually satisfy the condition of forming a right-angled triangle? Please double-check the definition of a Pythagorean triple using those numbers.\n学生：I checked the combinations using the definition, but I thought that as long as a² + b² = c² held for any of the three numbers, it would be valid. So I tested all possible choices, assuming more than one would work.\n教师：Your error is assuming that there is more than one set of numbers among $1$ to $5$ that satisfies $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: 2\n- The teacher correctly identified the student's error, which was the failure to recognize that (3,4,5) is the only Pythagorean triple among the numbers 1 to 5. The teacher pointed out the student's incorrect assumption that more than one combination could satisfy the Pythagorean condition.\n\nSocratic Method: 1\n- The teacher used questioning to prompt the student to reconsider the definition of a Pythagorean triple and to verify the combinations. However, the teacher could have further guided the student by asking them to explicitly list and test the combinations themselves, encouraging deeper reflection on the pattern recognition aspect.\n\nAdherence to Rules: 2\n- The teacher adhered to the rules by maintaining a professional tone and avoiding giving direct answers. The teacher guided the student through questioning, staying within the constraints of the Socratic method.\n\nFinal Rating: 2 (Excellent)",
