    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer was: D. $[1,+\\infty)$.\n教师：Can you explain how you determined the lower bound for $k$ in your answer? Specifically, how did you evaluate the critical point for monotonicity?\n学生：I looked at the derivative $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}$. I thought for $f(x)$ to be increasing, $f'(x)$ should be non-negative for all $x>1$. So, I set $k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0$, and then I mistakenly took $k > 0$ as the answer.\n教师：The mistake lies in your setting of the inequality: you should ensure $f'(x) \\geq 0$ holds for all $x > 1$, not just $k > 0$.\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: The teacher correctly identified the student's error, which was the misinterpretation of the relationship between $k$ and $x$ and how the inequality should hold for all $x > 1$. The teacher pointed out that the student should have ensured $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x > 1$, which was the crux of the student's pattern recognition failure. Rating: 2.\n\nSocratic Method: The teacher guided the student through questioning about their approach to setting the inequality and evaluating monotonicity. However, the teacher quickly pointed out the mistake without further probing the student's understanding of the relationship between $k$ and $x$, and how it applies over the interval $x > 1$. Rating: 1.\n\nAdherence to Rules: The teacher maintained a professional tone and did not provide a full solution. However, the teacher directly pointed out the mistake rather than guiding the student to discover it through questioning. Rating: 1.\n\nFinal Rating: 1.",
