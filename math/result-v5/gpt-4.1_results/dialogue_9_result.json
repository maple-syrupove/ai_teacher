Did you consider the domain of $f(x)$ as part of your process?\n学生：I found the derivative of $f(x)$ and set it greater than zero to find where the function increases. I did not explicitly consider the domain first.\n教师：You did not consider the domain of $f(x)$ when determining the intervals, which is essential for identifying valid intervals of monotonicity.\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: 2\nThe teacher accurately identified the student's error by pointing out that the student failed to consider the domain of the function before determining the intervals of monotonicity. This aligns with the specific error point in the provided JSON.\n\nSocratic Method: 1\nThe teacher used some Socratic questioning by asking the student about their method and whether they considered the domain. However, the teacher quickly pointed out the error without guiding the student to discover it themselves, which reduces the effectiveness of the Socratic method.\n\nAdherence to Rules: 1\nThe teacher maintained a professional tone and avoided providing a full solution. However, the teacher directly identified the error instead of guiding the student to realize it through questioning, which slightly deviates from the constraints of not directly giving answers.\n\nFinal Rating: 1 (Mediocre)",
