    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer is A, $i(1+i)^2$.\n教师：Could you walk me through your calculation of $i(1 + i)^2$? Specifically, what value did you get for $(1 + i)^2$?\n学生：For $(1+i)^2$, I calculated it as $(1+i)\\times(1+i) = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i$.\n教师：You calculated $(1+i)^2$ correctly as $2i$. How did you then compute $i \\times 2i$? What result did you get?\n学生：I did $i \\times 2i = 2i^2 = 2(-1) = -2$.\n教师：Your error is in assuming that $-2$ is purely imaginary, but $-2$ is a real number, not an imaginary one.\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: 2\n- The teacher accurately identified the student's error. The student mistakenly chose option A due to pattern recognition failure, assuming $i(1+i)^2$ was purely imaginary without verifying the real and imaginary components. The teacher helped the student realize that $-2$ is a real number, not imaginary.\n\nSocratic Method: 1\n- The teacher used effective questioning to guide the student through their calculations, helping them to re-evaluate their steps. However, the teacher's final statement could have been more focused on guiding the student to realize the error themselves rather than directly stating it.\n\nAdherence to Rules: 2\n- The teacher maintained a professional tone and did not provide full solutions or direct hints. The dialogue was conducted within the constraints of the Socratic method guidelines.\n\nFinal Rating: 2 (Excellent)",
