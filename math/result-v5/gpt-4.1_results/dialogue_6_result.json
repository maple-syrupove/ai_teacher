    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My (incorrect) answer was: \"φ cannot be solved.\"\n教师：You made an error in declaring φ cannot be solved. The problem provides enough information to determine φ.\n学生：Sorry, I didn't realize that the forms of the two trigonometric functions could be made the same for comparison.\n教师：That's a good reflection. Did you consider rewriting sine in terms of cosine to directly compare coefficients and phase shifts?\n学生：No, I didn't think to use the identity $\\sin\\theta = \\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ to rewrite the sine function as a cosine.\n教师：You have correctly identified that you missed using the identity to rewrite sine in terms of cosine. That was the source of your error.\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: The teacher accurately identified the student's error, which was the failure to use the identity $\\sin\\theta = \\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ to transform the problem and solve for $\\phi$. This corresponds directly to the error described in the Error JSON. Rating: 2.\n\nSocratic Method: The teacher effectively used Socratic questioning to guide the student towards recognizing their error, asking if the student considered rewriting sine in terms of cosine. This approach led the student to self-identify the missed transformation. Rating: 2.\n\nAdherence to Rules: The teacher adhered to the constraints by maintaining a professional tone and not providing a full solution, instead guiding the student to the realization of their error through questioning. Rating: 2.\n\nFinal Rating: 2 (Excellent).",
