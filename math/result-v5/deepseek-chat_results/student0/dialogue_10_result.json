    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My (incorrect) answer is: I couldn’t find the exact value for $M+m$ because I failed to solve for the extrema—my calculations got stuck.\nTeacher：Let me help identify where you might have gone wrong. Could you briefly describe how you attempted to find the extrema of the function?\nStudent：I started by trying to differentiate the original function $f(x)$ directly to find its maxima and minima. But the derivative became quite complex, and I couldn't simplify it or solve for critical points efficiently.\nTeacher：I see. When you differentiated the function, did you consider simplifying the original expression before taking the derivative? That might help identify if there's a simpler approach to finding extrema.\nStudent：No, I didn't try to simplify the original expression before differentiating. I directly worked with the fraction as it was.\nTeacher：Let me ask this: When you saw the $(x+1)^2$ in the numerator and $x^2+1$ in the denominator, did you consider expanding and separating the fraction into simpler terms before differentiation?\nStudent：No, I didn’t consider expanding or separating the fraction first. I just proceeded with the differentiation as it originally appeared.\nTeacher：I understand. Before moving to differentiation, did you notice that the function can be rewritten as $f(x) = 1 + \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$? This simpler form might help identify extrema more easily.\nStudent：No, I didn't realize the function could be rewritten in that form. I missed that simplification step before differentiating.\nTeacher：I see. Your error was not simplifying the original function before attempting differentiation, which made the problem unnecessarily complex.\nStudent：zzc",
