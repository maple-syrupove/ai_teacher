    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose B. I thought $A\\cap B=\\varnothing$.\nTeacher：Let me understand your reasoning. Can you first tell me how you interpreted set B: $\\{x \\mid 3-2x > 0\\}$?\nStudent：I wrote $B= \\{x \\mid 3-2x > 0\\}$, but I didn't further simplify the inequality. I just left it as is.\nTeacher：Let's examine set B more carefully. What do you get when you solve the inequality 3 - 2x > 0 for x?\nStudent：Solving $3-2x>0$ gives $-2x>-3$, so $x<\\frac{3}{2}$. So $B=\\{x\\mid x<\\frac{3}{2}\\}$.\nTeacher：Now that you've simplified set B correctly, let's reconsider the intersection A ∩ B. Given A = {x | x < 2} and B = {x | x < 3/2}, what would A ∩ B be?\nStudent：The intersection $A \\cap B$ would be all $x$ such that $x < 3/2$, so $A \\cap B = \\{x \\mid x < 3/2\\}$.\nTeacher：I see your error now. You initially thought A ∩ B was empty, but after correctly simplifying B, you realized it's actually all x less than 3/2. Your mistake was not solving the inequality for set B completely at first.\nStudent：zzc",
