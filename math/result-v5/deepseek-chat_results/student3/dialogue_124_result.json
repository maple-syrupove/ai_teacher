    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Let me ask: What is the definition of an odd function, and how did you verify that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ satisfies it?\nStudent：An odd function satisfies $h(-x) = -h(x)$ for all $x$. I checked $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ and thought since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, their product would keep the property, and the absolute value would still be odd.\nTeacher：Let's test your reasoning. For option D, what would $h(-x)$ be if $h(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$, using the properties of odd and even functions?\nStudent：If $h(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$, then $h(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$. Since $f(-x) = -f(x)$ and $g(-x) = g(x)$, this becomes $|-f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：Let's continue: What does $|-f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ simplify to, and how does this compare to $-h(x)$?\nStudent：$|-f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$, so $h(-x) = h(x)$. This matches the definition of an even function, not odd.\nTeacher：You've correctly identified your error: you confused the properties of odd and even functions when applying the absolute value. The function in option D is actually even, not odd.\nStudent：Yes, you're right. My mistake was thinking the absolute value would preserve oddness, but it actually makes it even.\nTeacher：zzc\nStudent：zzc",
