    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was B.\nTeacher：What is the solution set for set B?\nStudent：The solution set for set B is $\\{x \\mid 3-2x > 0\\}$. Solving $3-2x>0$, we get $x<\\frac{3}{2}$. So $B = \\{x \\mid x<\\frac{3}{2}\\}$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified set B as $ \\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2} \\} $. What is the relationship between sets A and B?\nStudent：Set A is $\\{x \\mid x<2\\}$ and set B is $\\{x \\mid x<\\frac{3}{2}\\}$. Since $x<\\frac{3}{2}$ is more restrictive than $x<2$, B is a subset of A.\nTeacher：You stated that B is a subset of A. What does this imply about the intersection $ A \\cap B $?\nStudent：If B is a subset of A, then $A \\cap B$ should be equal to B, that is, $\\{x \\mid x<\\frac{3}{2}\\}$.\nTeacher：A. $A \\cap B = \\left\\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2} \\right\\}$, which contradicts your choice of B.\nStudent：You're right. I should have chosen A as my answer instead of B.\nTeacher：You have corrected your answer. However, let's confirm: if B is a subset of A, what does that imply about the union $ A \\cup B $?\nStudent：If B is a subset of A, then $A \\cup B$ is just set A, which is $\\{x \\mid x<2\\}$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $ A \\cup B = A $, which is $ \\{x \\mid x < 2\\} $. However, option D claims $ A \\cup B = \\mathbb{R} $, which is incorrect. Your answer should not be D.\nStudent：Yes, my answer should not be D. Since $A \\cup B = \\{x \\mid x < 2\\}$, D is not correct.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $ A \\cup B = \\{x \\mid x < 2\\} $. Therefore, your original answer of B is incorrect. The correct answer is A.\nStudent：Yes, I understand. My original answer was B, but based on the above discussion, the correct answer is A.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that your original answer was incorrect. The correct answer is A.\nStudent：Yes, my original answer was B.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that your original answer was incorrect.

    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: 0\nSocratic Method: 1\nAdherence to Rules: 1\n\nThe teacher failed to identify the student's true error, which was a strategic misunderstanding in transforming the problem and applying set intersection concepts. Instead, the teacher focused on confirming the correct answer repeatedly without addressing the underlying issue in the student's reasoning. The Socratic method was somewhat applied initially, but it devolved into repetitive confirmation rather than exploring the student's thought process. The teacher adhered to some rules but failed to maintain the Socratic approach throughout and did not address the student's strategic error.",
