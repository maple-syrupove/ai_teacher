    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was: I wasn't able to provide a value for $M+m$ because my calculations became too complicated.\nTeacher：What method did you use to find the maximum and minimum values of the function?\nStudent：I tried to directly differentiate the original function to find stationary points and then determine the maxima and minima from there.\nTeacher：What did you do with the derivative once you found it?\nStudent：After finding the derivative, I attempted to set it to zero and solve for $x$, but the resulting equation was very complex and I couldn't solve it.\nTeacher：What did you observe about the behavior of the function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches positive and negative infinity?\nStudent：As $x$ approaches positive or negative infinity, $f(x)$ approaches $1$, since the highest degree terms in numerator and denominator dominate.\nTeacher：You correctly observed that $ f(x) \\to 1 $ as $ x \\to \\pm\\infty $. However, this does not necessarily mean the maximum and minimum values of $ f(x) $ are symmetric around 1. You need to analyze the function's behavior more carefully to determine $ M $ and $ m $.\nStudent：Yes, I understand. I tried to analyze the stationary points, but the calculations became too long, and I didn't explore other methods to simplify the function.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the function can be simplified or analyzed using symmetry or bounds, which would have made finding $ M $ and $ m $ more straightforward.\nStudent：zzc",
