    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was A. $\\{-2,-1,0,1\\}$.\nTeacher：Your answer includes 1, which is not in set M. What is the condition for membership in set M?\nStudent：Set M includes all real numbers x such that -3 < x < 1, so x must be greater than -3 and less than 1.\nTeacher：Your answer includes 1, which is not in set M. What is the upper bound of set M?\nStudent：The upper bound of set M is 1, but 1 is not included since it is a strict inequality (-3 < x < 1).\nTeacher：Your answer includes 1, which is not in set M. What is the upper limit of set M and how does it affect the intersection with set N?\nStudent：The upper limit is 1, but since 1 is not included in M, elements equal to 1 from N should not be in the intersection.\nTeacher：Your answer includes 1, which is not in set M. What elements of set N are strictly less than 1?\nStudent：The elements of set N that are strictly less than 1 are -3, -2, -1, and 0.\nTeacher：Your answer includes 1, which is not in set M. Therefore, the correct intersection is $\\{-3, -2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：But -3 is not in M either, because -3 < x, so x must be greater than -3.\nTeacher：You are correct that -3 is not in M. What is the lower bound of set M and how does it affect the intersection with set N?\nStudent：The lower bound is -3, but since it is a strict inequality, -3 is not included in set M, so it should not be in the intersection.\nTeacher：Your answer includes -3, which is not in set M. What elements of set N are strictly greater than -3 and strictly less than 1?\nStudent：The elements of set N that are strictly greater than -3 and strictly less than 1 are -2, -1, and 0.\nTeacher：The correct intersection is $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$. Your answer includes -3 and 1, which are not in set M.\nStudent：I see, my mistake was that I directly took all the elements from N within the interval -3 to 1, including endpoints, without carefully checking if -3 and 1 are actually included in set M.\nTeacher：Your mistake was including -3 and 1 in the intersection, as set M excludes these endpoints due to the strict inequality.\nStudent：zzc",
