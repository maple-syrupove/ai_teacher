    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C: $(1,+\\infty)$ as the monotonically increasing interval.\nTeacher：What is the domain of the function $f(x) = \\ln(x^2 - 2x - 8)$?\nStudent：The domain is where $x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0$, which means $x < -2$ or $x > 4$.\nTeacher：What is the derivative of $f(x) = \\ln(x^2 - 2x - 8)$?\nStudent：The derivative is $f'(x) = \\dfrac{2x - 2}{x^2 - 2x - 8}$.\nTeacher：What is the sign of $f'(x)$ on the intervals $(-\\infty, -2)$ and $(4, +\\infty)$?\nStudent：On $(-\\infty, -2)$, $f'(x)$ is negative. On $(4, +\\infty)$, $f'(x)$ is positive.\nTeacher：The function is monotonically increasing where $f'(x) > 0$. Based on your analysis, where is $f'(x) > 0$?\nStudent：Based on my analysis, $f'(x) > 0$ on the interval $(4, +\\infty)$.\nTeacher：D. $(4,+\\infty)$ is the correct answer. However, you chose C: $(1,+\\infty)$. Why did you select this interval?\nStudent：I selected $(1, +\\infty)$ because when I solved $f'(x) > 0$, I got $x > 1$, so I thought the function increased on that interval.\nTeacher：You incorrectly solved $f'(x) > 0$ by ignoring the domain of the original function. The interval $(1, +\\infty)$ is not part of the domain of $f(x)$.\nStudent：zzc",
