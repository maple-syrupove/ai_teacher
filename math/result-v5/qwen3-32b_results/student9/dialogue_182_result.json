    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is C, $(1,+\\infty)$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined the domain of $ f(x) $?\nStudent：I considered $x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0$, so the domain is $x < -2$ or $x > 4$.\nTeacher：Teacher：Then, how did you determine where $ f(x) $ is increasing?\nStudent：I differentiated $f(x)$ with respect to $x$, set the derivative greater than zero, and solved for $x$.\nTeacher：Can you write the derivative $ f'(x) $ and show how you solved the inequality $ f'(x) > 0 $?\nStudent：Sure. $f'(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 2x - 8} \\cdot (2x - 2) = \\frac{2x - 2}{x^2 - 2x - 8}$.  \nSetting $f'(x) > 0$, I got $x > 1$ (after considering the sign).\nTeacher：Your mistake is in concluding $ x > 1 $ as the solution to $ f'(x) > 0 $, ignoring the domain restrictions. The derivative must be considered only where the function is defined, i.e., $ x < -2 $ or $ x > 4 $.\nStudent：zzc",
