    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I couldn't solve for $\\phi$ because I thought the two functions couldn't be equated directly.\nTeacher：Why did you think the two functions couldn't be equated directly? What relationship must exist between them after the shift?\nStudent：I thought they couldn’t be equated directly because one is a cosine function and the other is a sine function. I didn’t realize how to connect them. After the shift, their graphs coincide, so their values must be equal for all $x$.\nTeacher：Teacher：So, you now agree that after the shift, the two functions must be equal for all $x$. How did you apply the shift to the cosine function?\nStudent：After shifting right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, I wrote the cosine function as $y = \\cos\\left(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi\\right)$.\nTeacher：Good. Then you set this shifted cosine function equal to the sine function. How did you proceed?\nStudent：At that point, I didn't know how to proceed further because I saw one was still a cosine and the other a sine, so I stopped.\nTeacher：Teacher：So you stopped because you didn't know how to relate $\\cos$ and $\\sin$. Did you consider using a trigonometric identity to convert one into the other?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider that. I forgot about the identities that connect sine and cosine, so I didn't try to convert one into the other.\nTeacher：Teacher：What identity relates $\\cos(\\theta)$ to $\\sin(\\theta)$? Did you consider a phase shift between them?\nStudent：I know that $\\sin\\theta = \\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, but at the time, I didn't think to use this to connect them.\nTeacher：Excellent. Now that you’ve recalled the identity, how did you use it in your equation? Did you adjust the phase accordingly?\nStudent：I didn't use it in my equation. I didn't adjust the phase or transform the cosine into a sine, so I couldn't proceed.\nTeacher：Then how did you attempt to equate the two functions after the shift?\nStudent：I didn’t equate them directly because I didn’t know how to handle the difference between cosine and sine, so I just gave up at that point.\nTeacher：Teacher：So you never actually formed an equation to solve for $\\phi$. Why not? What step did you skip entirely?\nStudent：I skipped the step of transforming the cosine to sine or vice versa using identities, so I couldn't write them in comparable forms and set up the equation for $\\phi$.\nTeacher：Exactly. You skipped the critical step of using a trigonometric identity to express both functions in terms of the same trigonometric function, which is necessary to equate their arguments and solve for $\\phi$.\nStudent：zzc",
