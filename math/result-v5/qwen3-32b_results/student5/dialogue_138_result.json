    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was A. $\\frac{3}{10}$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you arrived at the numerator of your probability?\nStudent：I looked at all possible combinations of 3 numbers from 1 to 5 and tried to check which ones could form a right triangle, counting the ones that worked.\nTeacher：How many total combinations of 3 numbers did you consider?\nStudent：I counted a total of 10 different combinations, since there are $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways to pick 3 numbers from 1 to 5.\nTeacher：Teacher：How many of these combinations did you find to form a Pythagorean triple?\nStudent：I thought that three combinations could form a Pythagorean triple, so I used 3 as the numerator.\nTeacher：That is not correct.
