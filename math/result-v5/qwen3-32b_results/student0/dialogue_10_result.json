    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I wasn't able to find a specific value for $M + m$ because my calculation for the extrema got stuck when I tried to directly differentiate the original expression.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you approached finding the derivative of $ f(x) $?\nStudent：I used the quotient rule to find $f'(x)$. I set $u=(x+1)^2+\\sin x$ and $v=x^2+1$, then calculated $f'(x)=\\frac{u'v-u v'}{v^2}$, but the expression became very complicated.\nTeacher：Can you write the expressions for $ u' $ and $ v' $?\nStudent：Yes. I found $u' = 2(x+1) + \\cos x$ and $v' = 2x$.\nTeacher：What did you do after substituting $ u' $ and $ v' $ into the quotient rule expression?\nStudent：After substituting, I got $f'(x) = \\frac{\\left[2(x+1)+\\cos x\\right](x^2+1) - \\left((x+1)^2+\\sin x\\right)2x}{(x^2+1)^2}$. I tried to expand and simplify the numerator but it was messy and hard to solve for zero.\nTeacher：What did you conclude about the numerator after expanding? Did you attempt to find specific critical points or analyze its structure?\nStudent：I tried to expand the numerator, but it resulted in a complicated expression with multiple terms involving $x$ and trigonometric functions. I couldn't identify critical points directly due to its complexity, so I wasn't able to proceed further.\nTeacher：What method did you consider for finding the critical points when the algebraic approach became too complex?\nStudent：When the algebraic approach became too complex, I considered trying to estimate values or look for obvious extrema, but I did not try to transform the function into a simpler form.\nTeacher：What observation did you make about the structure of the original function $ f(x) $ that might help simplify your approach?\nStudent：I noticed that the numerator, $(x+1)^2+\\sin x$, could potentially be rewritten, but I didn't see a clear way to simplify it at that moment, so I stuck with the original form.\nTeacher：What effect does the symmetry of $ f(x) $ have on the relationship between $ M $ and $ m $?\nStudent：I didn't consider the symmetry of $f(x)$ when analyzing the extrema, so I wasn't able to draw any conclusion about the relationship between $M$ and $m$.\nTeacher：What is $ f(x) + f(-x) $?\nStudent：Let me compute it:\n\n\\[\nf(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1} + \\frac{((-x)+1)^2 + \\sin(-x)}{(-x)^2+1}\n\\]\n\nSince $(-x)^2 = x^2$ and $\\sin(-x) = -\\sin x$, and $(-x)+1 = 1-x$, so $((1-x)^2)$.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nf(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1} + \\frac{(1-x)^2 - \\sin x}{x^2+1}\n\\]\n\nCombine numerators:\n\n$(x+1)^2+\\sin x + (1-x)^2-\\sin x = (x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2$\n\n\\[\n(x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 1) + (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 2x^2 + 2\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nf(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{2(x^2+1)}{x^2+1} = 2\n\\]\nTeacher：Therefore, $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $. What does this imply about the relationship between the maximum value $ M $ and the minimum value $ m $?\nStudent：Since $f(x) + f(-x) = 2$ for all $x$, it means that if $f(x)$ reaches its maximum $M$ at some $x_0$, then $f(-x_0)$ reaches its minimum $m$, so $M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that if $ f(x) $ achieves a maximum at $ x_0 $, then $ f(-x_0) $ must be the minimum. However, is there any justification for this specific pairing of $ x_0 $ and $ -x_0 $ as corresponding to $ M $ and $ m $?\nStudent：I don't have a strict justification for that pairing. I just assumed that the minimum would occur at $-x_0$ since $f(x) + f(-x) = 2$, but I didn't prove that $x_0$ and $-x_0$ are exactly where $M$ and $m$ are attained.\nTeacher：Your conclusion that $ M + m = 2 $ relies on the assumption that $ f(x_0) = M $ implies $ f(-x_0) = m $. However, this is not necessarily true unless you establish that $ -x_0 $ is where the minimum occurs. What guarantees that the maximum and minimum are attained at paired points $ x_0 $ and $ -x_0 $?\nStudent：There’s no direct guarantee unless $f(x)$ is strictly monotonic or achieves its extreme values only at those symmetrical points, which I did not prove.\nTeacher：Correct. You assumed the extrema occur at paired symmetric points without justification. This invalidates your conclusion about $ M + m $.\nStudent：I understand. I shouldn’t have concluded that $M + m = 2$ based just on the symmetry without properly analyzing where the extrema are actually achieved.\nTeacher：You correctly recognized the symmetry of $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $, but your error was assuming that this identity alone implies $ M + m = 2 $ without verifying that $ M $ and $ m $ are attained at paired symmetric points.\nStudent：zzc",
