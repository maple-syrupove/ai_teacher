    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was C, $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you arrived at your answer?\nStudent：I saw $\\cos^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$, so I rewrote it using $1-\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ and tried to use the given $\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$ in my calculation.\nTeacher：That seems like an indirect approach. Why did you choose to rewrite the expression in terms of sine instead of using a more direct identity involving cosine squared?\nStudent：I thought it would be easier to work with sine squared, since I’m used to the identity $1-\\sin^2A = \\cos^2A$. I didn’t consider other relevant identities at that moment.\nTeacher：Teacher：Okay. So you used $1 - \\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ as the expression for $\\cos^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$. Can you show how you related this to $\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$?\nStudent：I substituted $\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$ directly for $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$, thinking they were connected, so I got $\\cos^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{5}{9}$.\nTeacher：Ah, I see. Your mistake is assuming that $\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$ is equivalent to $\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{2}{3}$, which is incorrect. These are not the same expressions.\nStudent：zzc",
