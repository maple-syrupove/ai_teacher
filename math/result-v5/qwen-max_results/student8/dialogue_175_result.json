    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Can you walk me through how you expanded $(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：Sure. $(1+i)^2 = (1+i)(1+i) = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$.\nTeacher：And then, how did you proceed with multiplying by $i$?\nStudent：After expanding, I got $i \\times 2i = 2i^2 = 2(-1) = -2$.\nTeacher：You correctly expanded $(1+i)^2$ to $2i$, but there seems to be a mistake in your final step. What did you get when you multiplied $i$ by $2i$?\nStudent：When I multiplied $i$ by $2i$, I got $2i^2$, which equals $-2$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $2i^2$ as $-2$, but you need to re-evaluate whether $-2$ is a purely imaginary number. What is the definition of a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：A purely imaginary number is a complex number with zero real part and nonzero imaginary part, like $bi$ where $b \\neq 0$.\nTeacher：You are correct about the definition of a purely imaginary number. Given that $-2$ is a real number, can you see why your result for option A does not fit the definition?\nStudent：Yes, $-2$ is a real number, so it doesn't fit the definition of a purely imaginary number since its imaginary part is zero.\nTeacher：Exactly. You've identified the mistake: $-2$ is a real number, not a purely imaginary number. Good job recognizing that.\nStudent：Thank you. I realize now that my initial choice of option A, $i(1+i)^2$, does not yield a purely imaginary number, since the result is $-2$, a real number.\nTeacher：You've correctly identified the mistake. Option A does not yield a purely imaginary number. Well done.\nStudent：Thank you. I see that now. Should I try to expand option B next to check if it’s a purely imaginary number?\nTeacher：That's a good next step. Please go ahead and expand option B, $i^2(1-i)$.\nStudent：Sure. First, $i^2 = -1$. So $i^2(1-i) = -1 \\times (1-i) = -1 + i$.\nTeacher：You've correctly expanded option B to $-1 + i$. Now, does this result fit the definition of a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：No, $-1 + i$ is not purely imaginary because it has both a real part ($-1$) and an imaginary part ($i$).\nTeacher：Exactly. You've correctly identified that $-1 + i$ is not a purely imaginary number because it has a non-zero real part. Good job.\nStudent：Thank you. Should I proceed to check option C, $(1+i)^2$?\nTeacher：Yes, go ahead and expand option C, $(1+i)^2$.\nStudent：$(1+i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$.\nTeacher：You've correctly expanded $(1+i)^2$ to $2i$. Does this result fit the definition of a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：Yes, $2i$ fits the definition of a purely imaginary number because its real part is $0$ and its imaginary part is non-zero.\nTeacher：You are correct. $2i$ is a purely imaginary number because it has a real part of 0 and a non-zero imaginary part. Good job!\nStudent：Thank you! I understand now that option C, $(1+i)^2$, actually gives a purely imaginary number, $2i$.\nTeacher：You've correctly identified that option C, $(1+i)^2$, results in a purely imaginary number, $2i$. Well done!\nStudent：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：You've already worked through option A and found that it results in a real number, $-2$. Let's focus on the next steps. Would you like to check another option?\nStudent：Yes, let’s check option D: $i(1+i)$. I will expand it next.\nTeacher：Great. Please go ahead and expand option D, $i(1+i)$.\nStudent：Expanding $i(1+i)$, I get $i \\times 1 + i \\times i = i + i^2 = i + (-1) = -1 + i$.\nTeacher：You've correctly expanded $i(1+i)$ to $-1 + i$. Does this result fit the definition of a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：No, $-1 + i$ is not purely imaginary since it has both a real part ($-1$) and an imaginary part ($i$).\nTeacher：Exactly. You've correctly identified that $-1 + i$ is not a purely imaginary number because it has a non-zero real part. Good job!\nStudent：Thank you! I see now that only option C, $(1+i)^2$, gives a purely imaginary number, $2i$.\nTeacher：You've correctly identified that only option C, $(1+i)^2$, results in a purely imaginary number, $2i$. Well done!\nStudent：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：You've already determined that option A, $i(1+i)^2$, results in a real number, $-2$. Let's move on. Would you like to check another option?",
