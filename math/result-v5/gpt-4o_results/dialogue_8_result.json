    "history_prompt": "\n学生：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\n教师：Could you explain how you calculated the result of option A, $i(1+i)^2$? What steps did you take?\n学生：I saw $i$ and $(1+i)$, so I thought multiplying them and squaring might give a purely imaginary outcome, so I chose it directly without fully expanding each term.\n教师：When you saw $i(1+i)^2$, did you consider what $(1+i)^2$ simplifies to? Can you expand it to see its components?\n学生：$(1+i)^2 = (1+i)\\times(1+i) = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$\n教师：When you chose option A thinking it would result in a purely imaginary number, you expanded \\((1+i)^2\\) to \\(2i\\). What is the result when you multiply \\(i\\) by \\(2i\\)?\n学生：If I multiply \\(i\\) by \\(2i\\), I get \\(i \\times 2i = 2i^2 = 2(-1) = -2\\), which is a real number.\n教师：Option A results in a real number, not purely imaginary as you initially thought.\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: The teacher correctly identified the student's error, which was a pattern recognition failure. The student mistakenly assumed that the expression would yield a purely imaginary number without properly expanding and verifying the terms. The teacher guided the student to expand \\((1+i)^2\\) and realize the mistake in their assumption. Rating: 2\n\nSocratic Method: The teacher effectively used Socratic questioning by asking the student to explain their thought process and guiding them through the expansion of the expression. The teacher did not directly give answers but encouraged the student to verify their calculations step-by-step. Rating: 2\n\nAdherence to Rules: The teacher maintained a professional tone and adhered to the constraints of not providing full solutions or direct hints. The dialogue followed the Socratic method appropriately. Rating: 2\n\nFinal Rating: 2 (Excellent)",
