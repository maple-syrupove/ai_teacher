    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer is C: $(1, +\\infty)$.\n教师：What conditions must be true for \\( f(x) = \\ln(x^2 - 2x - 8) \\) to be increasing?\n学生：For \\( f(x) \\) to be increasing, its derivative \\( f'(x) \\) must be greater than zero, and the expression inside the logarithm, \\( x^2-2x-8 \\), must be positive.\n教师：Can you calculate and analyze \\( f'(x) \\) and the expression \\( x^2 - 2x - 8 \\) separately? Specifically, values that satisfy the positivity condition for \\( x^2 - 2x - 8 \\)?\n学生：Sure. First, \\( x^2 - 2x - 8 = (x-4)(x+2) \\). This is positive when \\( x < -2 \\) or \\( x > 4 \\).\n教师：What conclusions do you draw when both the derivative \\( f'(x) \\) is positive and \\( x^2 - 2x - 8 \\) is positive simultaneously?\n学生：Both conditions must be satisfied simultaneously, so \\( x \\) must be in intervals where both \\( f'(x)>0 \\) and \\( x^2-2x-8>0 \\), that is, \\( x<-2 \\) or \\( x>4 \\), but only within the intersection of intervals where both are positive.\n教师：Have you considered the sign of the derivative \\( f'(x) \\) within the interval \\( (1, +\\infty) \\) and compared it to where \\( x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0 \\)?\n学生：Within \\( (1, +\\infty) \\), \\( x^2 - 2x - 8 \\) is only positive for \\( x > 4 \\). So, the whole interval \\( (1, +\\infty) \\) doesn't satisfy \\( x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0 \\).\n教师：Your error lies in choosing interval \\( (1, +\\infty) \\) where \\( x^2 - 2x - 8 \\) is not completely positive.\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: 2\nThe teacher accurately identified the student's error by guiding them to consider the domain constraint of the function. The student initially failed to recognize the need to analyze the domain before determining the interval where the function is increasing. The teacher's questioning led the student to realize the mistake in choosing the interval \\( (1, +\\infty) \\) without considering the positivity of \\( x^2 - 2x - 8 \\).\n\nSocratic Method: 2\nThe teacher effectively used Socratic questioning by asking the student to break down the problem into analyzing the derivative and the expression inside the logarithm separately. The teacher avoided giving direct answers and instead guided the student to reconsider their approach and find the error themselves.\n\nAdherence to Rules: 2\nThe teacher adhered to all the constraints, maintaining a professional tone and not providing a full solution. The teacher successfully used questioning to lead the student to discover their mistake.\n\nFinal Rating: 2 (Excellent)",
