    "history_prompt": "\n学生：I chose A. $\\frac{3}{10}$.\n教师：Could you explain the reasoning or steps that led you to choose option A, $\\frac{3}{10}$?\n学生：I thought about all the ways to pick 3 numbers out of 5 and then tried to check for right triangles by plugging them into $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. I ended up with more than one possibility, so I went with A.\n教师：How many sets of 3 different numbers can you form from 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5?\n学生：There are $C_5^3 = 10$ sets of 3 different numbers you can form.\n教师：When considering combinations of numbers that might form right triangles, which specific sets did you find satisfying the equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) with distinct numbers from 1 to 5?\n学生：I found (3, 4, 5) and also mistakenly thought (1, 2, 3) and maybe (2, 3, 5) worked when I checked each set.\n教师：The error is assuming sets like (1, 2, 3) and (2, 3, 5) satisfy \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\).

    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: 2 - The teacher correctly identified the student's error, which was the failure to recognize that only (3, 4, 5) is a valid Pythagorean triple among the combinations considered.\n\nSocratic Method: 1 - The teacher used effective questioning to guide the student towards understanding their mistake, although there was a slight hint when the teacher asked specifically about sets satisfying the equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\).\n\nAdherence to Rules: 2 - The teacher maintained a professional tone and adhered to the constraints by not providing a full solution or directly pointing out the error until the student had the opportunity to reflect on their process.\n\nFinal Rating: 2 - Excellent",
