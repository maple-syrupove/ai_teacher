    "history_prompt": "\n学生：I chose D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\n教师：Can you explain why you think $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function?\n学生：I thought since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, their product might somehow be odd after taking the absolute value, so I chose D by intuition.\n教师：Can you recall the definition of an odd function?\n学生：Yes, an odd function satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\n教师：What about the definition of an even function? How does it compare to the definition of an odd function?\n学生：An even function satisfies $g(-x) = g(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain, while an odd function satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$. The difference is in the sign after substituting $-x$.\n教师：How does the definition of an odd function apply to the expression $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$?\n学生：To check if $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is odd, we should compute $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)|$ and see if it equals $-|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$.\n教师：What happens when you evaluate $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$ using the definitions of odd and even functions?\n学生：Using the definitions, $f(-x) = -f(x)$ and $g(-x) = g(x)$, so $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\n教师：The mistake lies in the conclusion that the absolute value does not change the function type. The product $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ results in an even function because taking the absolute value of a product removes any signs affecting oddness.\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: The teacher accurately identified the student's error in their intuitive selection of option D and guided them to understand that the absolute value operation affects the parity of the function. The teacher correctly pinpointed the student's failure to use the definition method for analysis. Rating: 2.\n\nSocratic Method: The teacher effectively used Socratic questioning by prompting the student to recall definitions and apply them to analyze the problem. The teacher avoided giving direct answers, instead leading the student to discover the error in their reasoning. Rating: 2.\n\nAdherence to Rules: The teacher maintained a professional tone and complied with the constraints by not providing a full solution and focusing on guiding the student through questioning. Rating: 2.\n\nFinal Rating: 2 (Excellent)",
