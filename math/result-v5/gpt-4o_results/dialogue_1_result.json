    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer was A. $\\{-2, -1, 0, 1\\}$.\n教师：Can you identify members in \\( N \\) that fall within the interval specified by \\( M = \\{x \\mid -3 < x < 1\\} \\)?\n学生：Yes, the members in \\( N \\) within that interval are \\(-2, -1, 0\\), and \\(1\\).\n教师：Let's consider the interval \\( M = \\{x \\mid -3 < x < 1\\} \\) again. Is \\( 1 \\) included in this interval?\n学生：No, \\( 1 \\) is not included in the interval since the inequality is strict (\\( x < 1 \\)).\n教师：Given that you've identified the interval correctly, what members of \\( N \\) are less than 1 and greater than -3?\n学生：The members of \\(N\\) that are less than 1 and greater than -3 are \\(-2, -1, 0\\).\n教师：You've correctly identified the members of \\( N \\) that fall within the interval defined by \\( M \\). The answer should be C. \\( \\{-2, -1, 0\\} \\) because \\( 1 \\) is not included in \\( M \\).\n学生：Understood, thank you for the correction. The correct answer should be C. {−2, −1, 0}.\n教师：The student's mistake was including \\(1\\) in their intersection set, despite \\(1\\) not being part of the interval defined by \\(M = \\{-3 < x < 1\\}\\).\n学生：Yes, I mistakenly included 1 in the intersection set even though it shouldn't be included since 1 is not part of the open interval defined by \\( M \\).\n教师：I'm glad we reached a clearer understanding of the problem. Please feel free to ask if you have more questions.\n学生：Thank you, teacher. I will pay closer attention to strict inequalities when identifying which elements belong to an interval in future problems.\n教师：You're welcome. Remember, understanding the nuances of open and closed intervals is crucial in set operations. Always double-check the boundaries when tackling similar problems. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n学生：Thank you, teacher. I'll make sure to look at interval boundaries carefully in future set problems.\n教师：That's a great approach! Paying close attention to interval boundaries will definitely help. Let me know if you need further clarification or have any other questions.\n学生：Thank you, teacher. I'll let you know if I have other questions.\n教师：I'm glad we've reached a clearer understanding of the problem. Feel free to approach me with any further questions or topics you'd like to discuss!\n学生：Thank you, teacher. I'll be more careful with interval notation in future problems.\n教师：You're welcome. Understanding these details ensures accuracy in set operations. If you have more questions or need further explanations, I'm here to help.\n学生：Thank you, teacher. I appreciate the feedback and will keep practicing set operations with careful attention to detail.\n教师：I'm glad you found the feedback helpful. If any new questions or set operation topics come up, feel free to reach out. Keep practicing and paying attention to those details!\n学生：Thank you, teacher. I'll continue practicing and let you know if I have any more questions.\n教师：You're most welcome. I'm glad to see you're motivated to improve your understanding. Remember, practice is key! If any questions arise, don't hesitate to approach me.\n学生：Thank you, teacher. I'll pay more attention to carefully analyzing all conditions in set problems next time.\n教师：You're welcome. Analyzing all conditions carefully is a great approach to solving set problems accurately. If you have any new questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to ask.\n学生：Thank you, teacher. I'll make sure to carefully compare each element with the set's interval conditions next time.\n教师：You're welcome. Comparing each element with the set's interval conditions is crucial. If more questions arise, feel free to ask.\n学生：Thank you, teacher. I'll let you know if I have more questions or need further clarification.\n教师：You're welcome. Feel free to reach out anytime you have questions or need clarification. Keep practicing, and good luck with your studies!\n学生：Thank you, teacher. I'll continue practicing and will reach out if I need more help.\n教师：You're welcome. Remember, I'm here if you have questions or need assistance in the future. Good luck with your practice!\n学生：My answer was A. {−2, −1, 0, 1}.\n教师：What are the criteria for an element to be part of the intersection \\( M \\cap N \\)?\n学生：An element must exist in both sets, so it needs to be in \\( N \\) and also satisfy \\( -3 < x < 1 \\) as defined by \\( M \\).\n教师：Which elements of set \\( N \\) satisfy the condition \\(-3 < x < 1\\) as defined by set \\( M \\)?\n学生：The elements are -2, -1, and 0.\n教师：The mistake in your initial answer was including \\( 1 \\) in the intersection \\( M \\cap N \\). The interval specified by \\( M = \\{-3 < x < 1\\} \\) does not include \\( 1 \\).\n学生：Yes, I included 1 by mistake in my intersection even though it is not in the interval.\n教师：I'm glad we identified the oversight in your answer. Remember, understanding the specifics of interval notation is key. If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: 2\nThe teacher accurately identified the student's error, which was incorrectly including the number 1 in the intersection set, despite it not being part of the interval defined by \\( M = \\{-3 < x < 1\\}\\).\n\nSocratic Method: 1\nThe teacher guided the student through questioning about the criteria for the intersection and which elements satisfy the condition. However, the teacher could have asked more probing questions to help the student realize the need for a more holistic view of the problem, such as asking about the student's initial thought process or strategy.\n\nAdherence to Rules: 2\nThe teacher maintained a professional tone and did not provide direct answers or solutions, adhering to the rules of the Socratic method.\n\nFinal Rating: 5/6\nOverall, the teacher correctly identified the error and mostly used effective questioning, but there was room for improvement in guiding the student to understand their strategic oversight.",
