    "history_prompt": "\n学生：I answered that \"$\\phi$ cannot be solved.\"\n教师：Why did you conclude that \\(\\phi\\) cannot be solved? What was your reasoning process?\n学生：Because one function was a cosine and the other was a sine, and I didn't see how to equate them directly, so I thought there wasn't enough information to solve for $\\phi$.\n教师：Have you tried using a trigonometric identity to express the sine function in terms of cosine, or vice versa, to make them comparable?\n学生：No, I didn't try that. I was only looking at their forms as sine and cosine separately, so I didn't think to use an identity to convert them.\n教师：What trigonometric identity could you consider using to express a sine function in terms of cosine, or vice versa?\n学生：I could use the identity $\\sin\\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ to convert the sine function into a cosine form.\n教师：How might using this identity help you in understanding how these two functions coincide?\n学生：If I use this identity, I can write the sine function as a cosine function. This way, both functions are in terms of cosine, which lets me set their inside expressions equal and solve for $\\phi$.\n教师：What steps did you follow to compare the expressions inside the cosine functions after applying the identity? Can you describe your thought process there?\n学生：Actually, I didn't reach that step initially because I failed to convert the sine function into a cosine form, so I didn't compare the expressions inside the cosine functions at all.\n教师：To clarify, the error lies in not using the identity \\(\\sin\\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\) to rewrite the sine function as a cosine function. This step was necessary to equate the internal expressions of the two functions correctly.\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: 2\nThe teacher accurately identified the student's error, which was the failure to use the identity \\(\\sin\\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\) to transform the sine function into a cosine function, allowing the comparison of the two functions.\n\nSocratic Method: 2\nThe teacher effectively used Socratic questioning to guide the student to recognize their oversight. By asking about the possibility of using trigonometric identities and prompting the student to consider specific identities, the teacher led the student to self-identify the solution path without directly providing the answer.\n\nAdherence to Rules: 2\nThe teacher adhered to all constraints, maintaining a professional tone and not providing a full solution. The dialogue was focused on guiding the student to discover their error through questioning.\n\nFinal Rating: 2 (Excellent)",
