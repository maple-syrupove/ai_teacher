    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: The teacher correctly identified the student's error in interpreting the intersection of sets. The student failed to transform the inequality for set B and assumed the intersection was empty without proper comparison, which matches the error described in the JSON. Rating: 2.\n\nSocratic Method: The teacher used effective questioning to guide the student to solve the inequality for set B and compare the conditions for sets A and B, allowing the student to realize the mistake themselves. Rating: 2.\n\nAdherence to Rules: The teacher adhered to all constraints, maintaining a professional tone and avoiding direct answers, instead using questions to lead the student to the correct understanding. Rating: 2.\n\nFinal Rating: 2 = Excellent.",
