    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer is: k > 0.\n教师：Why do you think the function is increasing when \\(k > 0\\)? Can you explain your reasoning?\n学生：I thought since $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}$, for $f'(x) \\geq 0$, $k$ just needs to be greater than $0$, because $\\frac{1}{x}$ is always positive for $x > 1$.\n教师：Could you verify what \\( f'(x) \\) simplifies to specifically over the interval \\( (1, +\\infty) \\)? What condition must \\( k \\) satisfy for \\( f'(x) \\geq 0 \\) across this interval?\n学生：Sure. Over $x > 1$, $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}$. To have $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x > 1$, $k$ must be at least as large as the maximum value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ over $x > 1$. Since $\\frac{1}{x}$ decreases from $1$ to $0$ as $x$ increases, the maximum is $1$ at $x=1^+$. So $k \\geq 1$ is needed.\n教师：Your approach to finding the maximum value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ is correct, but your comparison with $k$ is limited to the boundary at $x=1^+$. However, you mentioned $k \\geq 1$, which aligns with some options in the question. Let's consider the specific options. When choosing $k \\geq 1$, which of the provided option correctly represents the range?\n学生：The correct option that matches $k \\geq 1$ is option D: $[1,+\\infty)$.\n教师：Your explanation of how you determined \\( k \\geq 1 \\) was correct in regard to the condition that \\( f'(x) \\geq 0 \\) for \\( x > 1 \\). However, your original answer \\( k > 0 \\) was incorrect because it did not satisfy the condition of \\( f'(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\( (1, +\\infty) \\). Your revision to \\( k \\geq 1 \\) is appropriate and matches option D.\n学生：Thank you, teacher. I now see that my original answer, $k > 0$, was too broad and didn't account for needing $k \\geq 1$ to cover all $x > 1$.\n教师：Let's go over what you explained. Can you tell me which point on the interval $(1, +\\infty)$ you used to determine the maximum value of $\\frac{1}{x}$?\n学生：I used the point $x = 1^+$, since as $x$ approaches $1$ from the right, $\\frac{1}{x}$ approaches its maximum value of $1$.\n教师：Your error was believing \\( k > 0 \\) was sufficient for \\( f'(x) \\geq 0 \\) across \\( (1, +\\infty) \\), while \\( k \\) must be \\(\\geq 1\\).\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: 2 - The teacher accurately identified the student's error, which was the incorrect assumption that \\( k > 0 \\) would suffice for \\( f'(x) \\geq 0 \\) over the interval \\( (1, +\\infty) \\). The teacher guided the student to realize that \\( k \\geq 1 \\) was necessary.\n\nSocratic Method: 2 - The teacher effectively used Socratic questioning to guide the student to the correct understanding. They asked questions that led the student to reconsider the conditions under which \\( f'(x) \\) is non-negative and to correctly identify the maximum value of \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\).\n\nAdherence to Rules: 2 - The teacher adhered to all constraints, maintaining a professional tone and avoiding providing direct solutions. They guided the student through questioning and facilitated the student's self-correction.\n\nFinal Rating: 2 - Excellent",
