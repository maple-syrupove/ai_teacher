    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My incorrect answer is: I was unable to give a specific value for $M+m$ because I got stuck while differentiating $f(x)$ directly and did not finish the calculation.\n教师：What difficulty did you encounter when differentiating the function?\n学生：I found the derivative of $f(x)$ to be very complex due to the combination of $(x+1)^2$ and $\\sin x$ in the numerator, which made it hard to solve for critical points.\n教师：When you evaluated the complexity of differentiating $f(x)$, how did you manage the quotient rule and the combination of the two terms in the numerator?\n学生：I used the quotient rule directly on $f(x)$, but the resulting expression after applying it was lengthy and difficult to simplify, especially with the $\\sin x$ term added to $(x+1)^2$.\n教师：What specific challenges did you face when simplifying the derivative expression after applying the quotient rule?\n学生：The derivative involved terms like $2(x+1)(x^2+1)$ and $\\cos x (x^2+1)$ in the numerator, and combining them with the $-((x+1)^2+\\sin x)2x$ part made the algebra messy. I had trouble grouping like terms and simplifying.\n教师：It seems you've encountered a complexity that made the simplification process challenging. Given your difficulty, it's essential to revisit your initial decisions and assumptions starting with the derivative step of $f(x)$, ensuring the application of the quotient rule is in line with the function’s complete structure. Would you be able to reassess how the two distinct derivative calculations contribute to the expression you gathered?\n学生：Sure. When reassessing, the two parts—derivative of $(x+1)^2+\\sin x$ and derivative of $x^2+1$—each give several terms, and when substituted into the quotient rule formula, they result in a large, complicated numerator. It gets hard to collect terms and factor.\n教师：Did you consider evaluating any simpler approaches or transformations before moving directly to differentiation, given the complexity of $f(x)$?\n学生：No, I didn't consider transforming $f(x)$ into a simpler form before differentiating; I attempted to tackle the derivative directly.\n教师：Did you verify if there might be any values or transformations you missed that could simplify the problem before differentiating?\n学生：No, I didn't check for possible values of $x$ or consider any transformations that could simplify the expression before computing the derivative.\n教师：It seems your assumption was that straightforward differentiation of $f(x)$ would lead directly to critical points without assessing if there were simpler values or transformations such as setting the derivative equal to zero to solve for critical points. This overlooked potential simplification could hinder finding $M$ and $m$.\n学生：zzc",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: The teacher correctly identified the student's error, which was the failure to transform the function into a simpler structure before differentiation. Instead, the student attempted direct differentiation, leading to complex calculations and errors. The teacher guided the student to recognize the importance of considering transformations before differentiation, aligning with the error described in the Error JSON. Rating: 2.\n\nSocratic Method: The teacher effectively used Socratic questioning to guide the student toward realizing their error without directly providing answers or hints. The questions focused on the student's approach, assumptions, and potential simplifications, encouraging the student to reflect on their process and identify missed opportunities for simplification. Rating: 2.\n\nAdherence to Rules: The teacher adhered to the constraints by maintaining a professional tone, avoiding full solutions, and using questions to guide the student. The dialogue was consistent with the instructions provided. Rating: 2.\n\nFinal Rating: 2.",
