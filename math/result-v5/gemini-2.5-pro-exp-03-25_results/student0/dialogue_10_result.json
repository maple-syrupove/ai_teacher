    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was: I was unable to compute a specific value for $M+m$, because my differentiation became very complicated and I had to stop.\nTeacher：Before you began the process of differentiation, did you look for a way to rewrite or simplify the expression for the function $f(x)$?\nStudent：No, I directly tried to differentiate the original function without looking for a way to simplify or transform the expression first.\nTeacher：Can the fraction $\\frac{(x+1)^{2}+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$ be rewritten into a sum of simpler terms?\nStudent：I'm not sure how to rewrite it directly; I only saw the expression as it is and didn't try to split or simplify it. Could you suggest a way to start?\nTeacher：Let's focus on the numerator of the fraction. What do you get when you expand the expression $(x+1)^2$?\nStudent：Expanding $(x+1)^2$ gives $x^2 + 2x + 1$. So the numerator becomes $x^2 + 2x + 1 + \\sin x$.\nTeacher：Good. Now, how can you use this expanded form to split the fraction $\\frac{x^2 + 2x + 1 + \\sin x}{x^2+1}$ into simpler parts?\nStudent：I think I can write $\\frac{x^2 + 2x + 1 + \\sin x}{x^2+1} = \\frac{x^2+1}{x^2+1} + \\frac{2x}{x^2+1} + \\frac{\\sin x}{x^2+1}$.\nTeacher：That is a correct decomposition. What does the function $f(x)$ look like once you fully simplify this expression?\nStudent：After simplifying, $f(x) = 1 + \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$.\nTeacher：Let's focus on the part of the function that changes, which we can call $g(x) = \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$. What approach did you take to find its maximum and minimum values?\nStudent：I tried to directly differentiate $g(x)$ and set the derivative to zero to find extreme values, but got stuck in complex calculations.\nTeacher：Indeed, differentiation can be a challenging path. Before using calculus, are there any intrinsic properties of the function $g(x)$ that might simplify the problem? For example, what is the relationship between $g(x)$ and $g(-x)$?\nStudent：Let me check: \n\n$g(-x) = \\frac{2(-x) + \\sin(-x)}{(-x)^2 + 1} = \\frac{-2x - \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} = -\\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} = -g(x)$.\n\nSo $g(x)$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Excellent. Since $g(x)$ is an odd function, what does this imply about the relationship between its maximum value and its minimum value?\nStudent：Since $g(x)$ is odd, its maximum value and minimum value are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign; that is, $\\max g(x) = -\\min g(x)$.\nTeacher：How do $M$ and $m$, the maximum and minimum values of $f(x)$, relate to the maximum and minimum values of $g(x)$?\nStudent：Since $f(x) = 1 + g(x)$, then $M = 1 + \\max g(x)$ and $m = 1 + \\min g(x)$.\nTeacher：Given the relationships you've just described for $M$ and $m$, what do you get when you compute the sum $M+m$?\nStudent：Since $M = 1 + \\max g(x)$ and $m = 1 + \\min g(x)$, $M+m = 2 + (\\max g(x) + \\min g(x))$. Since $\\min g(x) = -\\max g(x)$, the sum is $2$.\nTeacher：Your method is now correct. Your initial error was attempting to solve the problem by directly differentiating the function in its original, complex form. This approach led to intractable calculations, preventing you from analyzing the function's simpler structure and symmetric properties.\nStudent：zzc",
