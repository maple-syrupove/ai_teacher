    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D, thinking that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ would be an odd function.\nTeacher：Hello. To begin, could you please tell me the definition of an odd function?\nStudent：An odd function satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Thank you. And what is the definition of an even function?\nStudent：An even function satisfies $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Very good. Let's test your choice, option D. Let $H(x) = |f(x) \\bullet g(x)|$. What is the result of $H(-x)$?\nStudent：$H(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$. Since $f(x)$ is odd, $f(-x) = -f(x)$, and since $g(x)$ is even, $g(-x) = g(x)$. Thus, $H(-x) = | -f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = H(x)$.\nTeacher：Based on your calculation, you found that $H(-x) = H(x)$.\n\nAccording to the definitions you provided, what kind of function satisfies the property $H(-x) = H(x)$?\nStudent：A function that satisfies $H(-x) = H(x)$ is an even function.\nTeacher：You have correctly shown that the function in option D is even. Your mistake was selecting option D, which states that this same function is odd.\nStudent：zzc",
