    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Hello. Could you please tell me what you calculated for the value of $(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：Sure, $(1+i)^2 = (1+i)(1+i) = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$.\nTeacher：Very good. Your calculation for $(1+i)^2$ is correct.\n\nSo for option A, you then have to multiply that result by $i$. What did you get for the final result of $i(2i)$?\nStudent：When I multiply $i$ and $2i$, I get $i \\times 2i = 2i^2 = 2(-1) = -2$.\nTeacher：You found the result for option A is -2. According to the definition of different number types, what kind of number is -2?\nStudent：-2 is a real number, not a purely imaginary number.\nTeacher：You have correctly demonstrated that the expression in option A results in a real number. Given that the question asks for a purely imaginary number, why did you select A?\nStudent：When I saw the $i$ and $(1+i)$ in the expression, I habitually thought, “If there’s an $i$, it must be purely imaginary,” so I quickly picked option A without carefully checking the calculation or separating real and imaginary parts.\nTeacher：Thank you for your honesty. Your error was not in calculation, but in making an assumption about the result based on the appearance of the terms, instead of completing the full calculation to verify the number's type.\nStudent：zzc",
