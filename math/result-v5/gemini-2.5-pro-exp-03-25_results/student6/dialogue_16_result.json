    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I wrote \"The value of $\\phi$ cannot be solved\" because I couldn't match the two functions.\nTeacher：Hello. Let's work through this problem together.\n\nFirst, can you tell me what the equation of the function becomes after shifting its graph to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units?\nStudent：After shifting the graph of $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the new equation becomes $y = \\cos\\left(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi\\right) = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：Excellent. You now have the equation of the shifted graph.\n\nHow did you then relate `y = cos(2x - π + φ)` to the other function, `y = sin(2x + π/3)`?\nStudent：I was stuck at that point because I saw that one was a cosine function and the other was a sine function, so I didn't know how to equate them or proceed further.\nTeacher：I understand. So the difficulty is in comparing a cosine function with a sine function.\n\nIs there any mathematical relationship you know of that connects the sine and cosine functions?\nStudent：Yes, I know that $\\sin \\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$, and similarly $\\cos \\theta = \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nTeacher：Excellent. You have the correct identities.\n\nSo, how did you use one of them to rewrite `y = sin(2x + π/3)` in terms of cosine?\nStudent：I actually didn't use the identity to rewrite the sine function as a cosine. I stopped there since I thought they couldn't be equated directly.\nTeacher：I see. You knew the conversion identity but chose not to apply it.\n\nIn what kind of mathematical problems would an identity like `sin(θ) = cos(θ - π/2)` be useful?\nStudent：It would be useful when you need to compare, combine, or solve equations involving both sine and cosine functions, or when you want all terms in the same trigonometric form.\nTeacher：Exactly. So, returning to this specific problem, how would you use one of those identities to make the two functions, `y = cos(2x - π + φ)` and `y = sin(2x + π/3)`, comparable?\nStudent：I could rewrite $y = \\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$ as $y = \\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\cos\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)$.\nTeacher：Excellent. Now you have two expressions for the same function. How do you set up an equation to find φ from here?\nStudent：I can set the arguments equal since the graphs coincide: $2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}$. Solving for $\\phi$ gives $\\phi = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$.\nTeacher：You have the equation `cos(2x - π + φ) = cos(2x - π/6)`.\n\nFrom this, you concluded that the expressions inside the cosine must be equal. Is that the only possibility for two angles to have the same cosine value?\nStudent：No, because $\\cos \\alpha = \\cos \\beta$ can also be true when $\\alpha + \\beta = 2k\\pi$ or $\\alpha - \\beta = 2k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer.\nTeacher：Correct. So, you have two general conditions for the arguments. You already explored one.\n\nWhat happens when you apply the other condition, `α + β = 2kπ`, to the arguments in your equation?\nStudent：If I use $\\alpha + \\beta = 2k\\pi$, then: $(2x - \\pi + \\phi) + (2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = 2k\\pi$, but this doesn't work for all $x$.\nTeacher：You have correctly analyzed both possible conditions for cosine equality. Your calculations for each case are accurate.\n\nYour error is assuming that because one condition (`α + β = 2kπ`) leads to an invalid equation, the solution found from the other condition (`α - β = 2kπ`) is also invalid. The failure of one case does not nullify a valid solution from another.\nStudent：Thank you for pointing that out. I now understand that, in this scenario, a valid value of $\\phi$ does exist; my earlier statement was incorrect.\nTeacher：You have correctly analyzed both conditions for cosine equality. Your error is assuming that because one condition leads to an invalid equation, the solution found from the other condition is also invalid. The failure of one case does not nullify a valid solution from another.\nStudent：zzc",
