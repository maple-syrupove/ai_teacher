Let's review your work.\n\nWhat condition must a number satisfy to be an element of set M?\nStudent：A number must be greater than -3 and less than 1 to be an element of set M.\nTeacher：You have correctly defined the condition for set M.\n\nLet's examine the numbers in set N. Does the number -3 satisfy the condition for being in set M?\nStudent：No, -3 does not satisfy the condition for being in set M, because it is not greater than -3.\nTeacher：That is correct. Now let's consider the number 1 from set N. Does it satisfy the condition for being in set M?\nStudent：No, 1 does not satisfy the condition for being in set M, because it is not less than 1.\nTeacher：You have correctly determined that -3 and 1 are not in set M.
