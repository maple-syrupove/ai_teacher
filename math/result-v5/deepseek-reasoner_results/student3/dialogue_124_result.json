    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D, thinking that $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：For the function in D, \\(h(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|\\), what is \\(h(-x)\\) after substituting the definitions of odd and even functions?\nStudent：If we substitute, $f(-x) = -f(x)$ (odd) and $g(-x) = g(x)$ (even), so:  \n$h(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |-f(x)\\cdot g(x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)| = h(x)$.\nTeacher：Based on your calculation for option D:  \n$h(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = h(x)$.  \nThis proves $h(-x) = h(x)$, meaning $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is even.  \nBut you initially chose D, claiming it is odd.  \nThe error is concluding that an even function is odd.\nStudent：No, my error wasn't just mislabeling even/odd; it was due to not systematically substituting and analyzing each option using $f(-x)$, $g(-x)$.\nTeacher：Consider an odd function \\(k(x)\\). Before this dialogue, what did you initially believe about the parity of \\(|k(x)|\\)?\nStudent：I initially thought that $|k(x)|$ might be odd if $k(x)$ is odd, but I didn't check with the definition.\nTeacher：You believed that the absolute value of an odd function is odd, but it is even.\nStudent：Yes, that's correct—$|k(x)|$ is actually an even function, not odd.\nTeacher：To ensure clarity in your approach, let's focus on the core definitions. For any function \\(h(x)\\), how do you determine if it's even or odd? Specifically, what expressions must you compute and compare?\nStudent：To determine if $h(x)$ is even, check if $h(-x)=h(x)$ for all $x$. To check if it's odd, see if $h(-x)=-h(x)$ for all $x$.\nTeacher：Based on our dialogue, you initially chose D because you believed that \\(|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|\\) is odd. However, you now recognize that \\(f(x) \\cdot g(x)\\) is odd, but the absolute value of any odd function is even. Therefore, your error was assuming that the absolute value of an odd function remains odd.\nStudent：zzc",
