    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I couldn't solve for $\\phi$. I thought the two functions were too different to compare directly.\nTeacher：To pinpoint your error, let's focus on the setup. How did you represent the function after shifting $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$?\nStudent：After shifting to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, I wrote the new function as $y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：To identify your error, let me clarify your shifting step. You wrote the shifted function as \\( y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi) \\), which simplifies to \\( \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) \\). This is correct.\n\nNow, this must equal \\( \\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) \\). How did you handle equating a cosine expression to a sine expression?\nStudent：I didn’t know how to make them the same type, so I got stuck and couldn’t set up a solvable equation for $\\phi$.\nTeacher：Your error is not utilizing a trigonometric identity to convert the cosine expression to a sine expression, preventing direct comparison.\nStudent：zzc",
