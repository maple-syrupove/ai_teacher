    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is A. I thought there were three combinations that could be Pythagorean triples.\nTeacher：To identify your error, let's focus on the triplet (1,2,5). What value did you use for the square of the hypotenuse when checking if it satisfies the Pythagorean theorem? \n\n(Keep your response brief and specific.)\nStudent：For (1,2,5), I used 5^2 = 25 as the hypotenuse squared.\nTeacher：What are the squares of the two legs in the triplet (1,2,5)?\nStudent：The squares are 1^2 = 1 and 2^2 = 4.\nTeacher：Based on our dialogue, you stated that you considered (1,2,5) as a Pythagorean triple. However, you calculated the squares correctly: 1² = 1, 2² = 4, and 5² = 25. The sum of the squares of the legs is 1 + 4 = 5, which does not equal 25. Therefore, (1,2,5) does not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem and cannot be a Pythagorean triple. Your error is including this invalid triplet in your count.\nStudent：zzc",
