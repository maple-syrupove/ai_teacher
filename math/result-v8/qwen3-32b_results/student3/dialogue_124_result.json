If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose D. $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined that the absolute value of the product results in an odd function?\nStudent：I just thought since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, their product may keep some kind of oddness, and the absolute value wouldn't change that.\nTeacher：What does the absolute value do to the sign of a function's output?\nStudent：The absolute value makes all outputs non-negative, so it removes any negative signs from the function's values.\nTeacher：How does this property affect the symmetry of an odd function?\nStudent：Since absolute value makes everything non-negative, it could destroy the 'oddness' since $|f(-x)g(-x)|$ would equal $|f(x)g(x)|$.\nTeacher：So, if the absolute value makes $ |f(-x)g(-x)| = |f(x)g(x)| $, what does this indicate about the symmetry of the resulting function?\nStudent：It indicates that the resulting function is even, not odd.\nTeacher：Your reasoning shows that the function is even, which means your initial choice of D was incorrect. The error is that you concluded an odd function results, when in fact the absolute value yields an even function.\nStudent：zzc",
