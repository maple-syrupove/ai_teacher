    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to calculate the derivative of $f(x)$ directly to find the extrema, but the differentiation became too complicated, and I couldn't continue the calculation or find $M+m$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you began the differentiation process?\nStudent：I applied the quotient rule: $f'(x) = \\frac{[(x^2+1)\\cdot((x+1)^2+\\cos x) - ((x+1)^2+\\sin x)\\cdot2x]}{(x^2+1)^2}$.\nTeacher：Your expression for the derivative is incorrect. You have incorrectly applied the derivative of the numerator. Specifically, the derivative of $(x+1)^2$ was not computed properly.\nStudent：I see. When differentiating the numerator, I took $(x+1)^2)'$ as $2(x+1)$ and $\\frac{d}{dx}[\\sin x]$ as $\\cos x$, but my final expanded expression was wrong.\nTeacher：Your mistake was not in the differentiation of $(x+1)^2$ or $\\sin x$, but in the subsequent algebraic simplification of the derivative expression.\nStudent：I understand. After applying the quotient rule and differentiating, I attempted to expand and combine the terms in the numerator, but got confused and couldn't simplify it correctly, so I stopped there.\nTeacher：Your mistake was in the algebraic simplification of the derivative expression after applying the quotient rule.\nStudent：No, my main issue wasn't with algebraic simplification after applying the quotient rule.\nTeacher：Then where exactly did you encounter difficulty in the process?\nStudent：I struggled to handle the complex expression after applying the derivative. The computations became overwhelming and I couldn't find a manageable way forward.\nTeacher：Your mistake was in incorrectly assuming that directly computing the derivative and simplifying it was the most effective approach, when a simpler method exists to find $M + m$.\nStudent：zzc",
