I was just focusing on finding the critical points by differentiation.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the function's numerator and denominator both approach infinity as $x$ approaches infinity, so you did not properly analyze the limit behavior.\nStudent：I don't think that was the issue. I did not consider the function's behavior at infinity because my calculations didn't get that far.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that the extrema occur solely at critical points without considering the possibility of the function approaching a finite limit as $x$ approaches infinity, which could influence the maximum and minimum values.\nStudent：I don't think I made that assumption; I just didn't finish my calculations after differentiating.\nTeacher：You incorrectly stopped your differentiation process without completing the analysis of critical points, which is essential for identifying extrema.\nStudent：I stopped because the differentiation got too complicated, and I couldn't simplify the expression to continue.\nTeacher：You incorrectly abandoned the differentiation process prematurely, preventing you from properly identifying critical points and analyzing the extrema.\nStudent：I stopped because the derivative became very complicated, and I couldn't continue calculating it to completion.\nTeacher：You incorrectly abandoned the differentiation process prematurely, preventing you from properly identifying critical points and analyzing the extrema.\nStudent：I stopped because I couldn't manage the complex derivative and didn't get any critical points.\nTeacher：You incorrectly concluded that no critical points exist without completing the differentiation and simplification process, which is essential for identifying extrema.\nStudent：I did not conclude there were no critical points.
