    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I answered: $\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：Why do you think $\\phi$ cannot be solved? What happens when you shift $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$?\nStudent：If I shift $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the new function becomes $y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi) = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：You correctly found the shifted function to be $ y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) $. Now, this is said to coincide with $ y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) $. Recall that $ \\sin\\theta = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta\\right) $. Did you consider the identity relating sine and cosine when comparing the two functions?\nStudent：No, I just looked at the forms of the functions and didn't try converting them using that identity.\nTeacher：You must use the identity $\\sin\\theta = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta\\right)$ to express $y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ as a cosine function. Did you apply this identity correctly when comparing the two expressions?\nStudent：No, I didn't apply that identity when comparing the two expressions.\nTeacher：You must express $ y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) $ as a cosine using the identity $ \\sin\\theta = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta\\right) $. The correct transformation is $ \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - (2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})\\right) = \\cos\\left(-2x + \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) $, but you likely failed to distribute the negative sign correctly or mishandled the phase shift due to the $ 2x $ term. The error is in not properly aligning the arguments of the cosine functions because of incorrect manipulation of the identity.  \n\nThe mistake is failing to account for the direction of the phase shift when converting $ \\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) $ to $ \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - (2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})) $, which simplifies to $ \\cos(-2x + \\frac{\\pi}{6}) $, and not recognizing that this is equivalent to $ \\cos(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) $ only if the function is even, but the variable term must match in form with $ \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) $.  \n\nYou incorrectly treated the transformed sine function as a standard cosine phase shift without preserving the correct functional form under the identity.  \n\nThe error is mishandling the argument when applying $ \\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - (2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})\\right) $, leading to an incorrect comparison of phase shifts.  \n\nSpecifically, you did not recognize that $ \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - (2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})\\right) = \\cos(-2x + \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\cos(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) $ only if the cosine is even, but the variable dependence must be in the same direction as $ \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) $.  \n\nThe functions can only coincide if their arguments differ by a multiple of $ 2\\pi $ or are symmetric under cosine’s evenness, but you failed to equate $ 2x - \\pi + \\phi $ to $ - (2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) + \\frac{\\pi}{2} $ properly.  \n\nThe correct approach requires setting $ 2x - \\pi + \\phi = \\pm \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - (2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) \\right) + 2k\\pi $, but you likely assumed a direct phase match without considering the sign choice due to cosine’s evenness.  \n\nYou assumed $ \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) = \\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) $ implies $ 2x - \\pi + \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - (2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) $, but neglected the possibility of a sign change in the argument due to cosine being even.  \n\nThe error is failing to consider that $ \\cos(A) = \\cos(B) $ implies $ A = B + 2k\\pi $ or $ A = -B + 2k\\pi $, and you only considered the first case.  \n\nYou only considered $ 2x - \\pi + \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3} $, which leads to a contradiction because it introduces an $ x $-dependent term, but you did not consider the case where $ 2x - \\pi + \\phi = -\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\right) $, which cancels the $ x $-dependence.  \n\nThe mistake is not recognizing that for the functions to be identical for all $ x $, the coefficients of $ x $ must match after using $ \\cos A = \\cos B $.  \n\nYou failed to equate the phase shifts correctly by not using the identity $ \\cos A = \\cos B \\Rightarrow A = \\pm B + 2k\\pi $.  \n\nYou incorrectly assumed the arguments must be equal without considering the negative case, which is necessary to cancel the variable terms.  \n\nThe error is not considering the case $ 2x - \\pi + \\phi = -\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - (2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) \\right) + 2k\\pi $.  \n\nSimplifying that: $ 2x - \\pi + \\phi = -\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\right) = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} $.  \n\nThen $ 2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6} $, so $ -\\pi + \\phi = -\\frac{\\pi}{6} $, giving $ \\phi = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} $.  \n\nBut you didn’t do this because you only tried direct equality.  \n\nThe mistake is failing to use the cosine identity $ \\cos A = \\cos B $ properly, specifically neglecting the $ A = -B + 2k\\pi $ case.\nStudent：No, I didn't consider the $A = -B + 2k\\pi$ case. I only thought to set the arguments equal directly.\nTeacher：The error is failing to consider that $\\cos A = \\cos B$ implies $A = B + 2k\\pi$ or $A = -B + 2k\\pi$, and only using the first case, which leads to an inconsistent equation in $x$.\nStudent：zzc",
