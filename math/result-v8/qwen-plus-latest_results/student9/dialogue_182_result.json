When you make this final diagnosis, your response for that turn must only contain the clear, concise statement of the error and must not end with a question mark. After making this definitive statement, wait for the student's final response. If the student does not reply with \"zzc,\" you should then begin a new line of questioning in the next turn, but do not repeat the same diagnosis..\n**The prompt history contains past dialogues. Strictly avoid mimicking the student's tone or restating their answers for analysis.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C. $(1,+\\infty)$.\nTeacher：Why did you choose the interval $(1, +\\infty)$ as the monotonically increasing interval for $f(x) = \\ln(x^2 - 2x - 8)$?\nStudent：Because after differentiating $f(x)$, I found $f'(x) > 0$ when $x > 1$, so I thought $f(x)$ increases on $(1, +\\infty)$.\nTeacher：You ignored the domain of the function $ f(x) = \\ln(x^2 - 2x - 8) $. The expression inside the logarithm, $ x^2 - 2x - 8 $, must be positive. The interval $ (1, +\\infty) $ includes values where the argument of the logarithm is negative, so the function is not defined there. Your mistake is not considering the domain before analyzing the derivative.\nStudent：zzc",
