    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by directly differentiating $f(x)$ and setting $f'(x)=0$, but the calculation became too complicated and I couldn't get a specific value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：Differentiating immediately is a common strategy. Before you took the derivative, did you try to algebraically rearrange or simplify the function $f(x)$?\nStudent：No, I didn't try to algebraically rearrange or simplify $f(x)$ before differentiating.\nTeacher：When you look at the expression $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^{2}+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$, do you see any relationship between the numerator and the denominator that might allow for simplification?\nStudent：I didn't notice any obvious relationship for simplification, so I proceeded directly with differentiation.\nTeacher：Okay. Let's look more closely at the function's structure. What do you get if you expand the $(x+1)^2$ term in the numerator?\nStudent：Expanding $(x+1)^2$ gives $x^2 + 2x + 1$, so the numerator becomes $x^2 + 2x + 1 + \\sin x$.\nTeacher：Now that the numerator is $x^2 + 2x + 1 + \\sin x$, can you rewrite the entire function $f(x)$? How might you use the denominator to simplify this new expression?\nStudent：The function becomes $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 1 + 2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} = 1 + \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$.\nTeacher：You have simplified the function correctly. Let's focus on the term $g(x) = \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$. What do you get if you evaluate this function at $-x$?\nStudent：If I evaluate $g(-x)$, I get $\\frac{-2x + \\sin(-x)}{(-x)^2 + 1} = \\frac{-2x - \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$.\nTeacher：How does your result for $g(-x)$ compare to the original expression for $g(x)$?\nStudent：Comparing the two, $g(-x) = -\\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} = -g(x)$. So, $g(x)$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：What does the property of $g(x)$ being an odd function imply about the relationship between its maximum value and its minimum value?\nStudent：If $g(x)$ is odd, its maximum and minimum values are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.\nTeacher：Let's denote the maximum and minimum of $g(x)$ as $M_g$ and $m_g$. How did you use the fact that $M_g = -m_g$ to find the value of $M+m$?\nStudent：I didn't use that property; I stopped after the calculations got too messy when differentiating.\nTeacher：Let's continue with this line of reasoning. Given that $f(x) = 1 + g(x)$, how would you express the maximum value of $f(x)$, which is $M$, in terms of the maximum value of $g(x)$?\nStudent：The maximum value $M$ of $f(x)$ is $1 + M_g$, where $M_g$ is the maximum value of $g(x)$.\nTeacher：And how would you express the minimum value of $f(x)$, which is $m$, in terms of the minimum value of $g(x)$?\nStudent：The minimum value $m$ of $f(x)$ is $1 + m_g$, where $m_g$ is the minimum value of $g(x)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly stated the expressions for both $M$ and $m$. Using these, what do you get for the sum $M+m$?\nStudent：$M + m = (1 + M_g) + (1 + m_g) = 2 + (M_g + m_g)$.\nTeacher：You have the sum as $2 + M_g + m_g$. What did you determine earlier about $g(x)$ that allows you to find the value of $M_g + m_g$?\nStudent：Earlier, I found that $M_g + m_g = 0$ because $M_g = -m_g$ for the odd function $g(x)$.\nTeacher：You previously established how $M+m$ relates to $M_g+m_g$. Given your last statement, what is the value of $M+m$?\nStudent：$M + m = 2 + 0 = 2$.\nTeacher：You did not simplify the function algebraically before you attempted to differentiate it.\nStudent：zzc",
