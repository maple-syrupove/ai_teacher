    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C. $(1,+\\infty)$.\nTeacher：Hello. To find the increasing interval of a function, what is the first property you should determine?\nStudent：The first property should be the domain of the function.\nTeacher：That's right. So, what did you determine the domain of this function to be?\nStudent：I found the domain to be $x^2-2x-8>0$, which gives $x<-2$ or $x>4$.\nTeacher：Excellent. The domain you found is correct. What was the next step you took in your analysis of the function?\nStudent：After finding the domain, I took the derivative of $f(x)$ and set $f'(x) > 0$ to find the increasing interval.\nTeacher：Very good. And what result did you obtain for the derivative of $f(x)$?\nStudent：I calculated $f'(x)=\\frac{2x-2}{x^2-2x-8}$ and set it greater than zero to solve for $x$.\nTeacher：Your derivative is correct. How did you proceed to solve the inequality $\\frac{2x-2}{x^2-2x-8} > 0$?\nStudent：I set the numerator $2x-2>0$ to get $x>1$, and checked for where the denominator is positive, then concluded $x>1$.\nTeacher：You did not find the intersection of the interval where the derivative is positive with the domain of the function.\nStudent：zzc",
