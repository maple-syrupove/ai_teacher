    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：φ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：How did you represent the function after shifting its graph to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units?\nStudent：After shifting to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, I wrote it as $y = \\cos\\left(2\\left(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\phi\\right)$.\nTeacher：That is the correct expression for the shifted function. The new function is a cosine function, but the one it needs to match is a sine function. How did you reconcile this difference in order to compare them?\nStudent：I didn't manage to reconcile the difference between the cosine and sine forms. I tried to compare them directly.\nTeacher：How did you attempt to 'compare them directly'? What equation, if any, did you try to set up between the two expressions?\nStudent：I tried setting up the equation $\\cos\\left(2x - \\pi + \\phi\\right) = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ directly.\nTeacher：After setting up the equation, what did you conclude about the relationship between the arguments, `2x - π + φ` and `2x + π/3`?\nStudent：I thought that since the expressions were not the same type, I couldn't set a direct relation between their arguments.\nTeacher：Are there any trigonometric identities that relate the sine function to the cosine function?\nStudent：Yes, one identity is $\\sin \\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nTeacher：Excellent. How did you use this identity to modify your equation?\nStudent：I didn't use this identity in my solution. I didn't think to apply it to modify the equation.\nTeacher：What principle led you to believe that you could not proceed with the equation `cos(A) = sin(B)` simply because the functions were different?\nStudent：I thought since cosine and sine are different functions, I couldn't equate them unless their forms matched exactly.\nTeacher：Does the equation `cos(x) = sin(x)` have any solutions?\nStudent：Yes, $cos(x)=sin(x)$ has solutions, such as $x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi n$, where $n$ is an integer.\nTeacher：Since you agree that an equation with a sine on one side and a cosine on the other can have a solution, what prevented you from using the identity you recalled to make the functions in your equation match?\nStudent：I didn't realize I could use the identity to rewrite one side and compare them in the same form.\nTeacher：Now that you have realized that, what is the next step you take in your solution?\nStudent：I would use the identity $\\sin\\theta = \\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ to rewrite the sine function as a cosine function, so both sides are in terms of cosine.\nTeacher：After you apply the identity to the right side of the equation, what is the resulting expression?\nStudent：After applying the identity, the right side becomes $\\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\cos\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)$.\nTeacher：You now have an equation in the form $\\cos(A) = \\cos(B)$, where the equality must hold for all $x$. What are the possible relationships between the arguments $A$ and $B$?\nStudent：The possible relationships are $A = B + 2k\\pi$ or $A = -B + 2k\\pi$, where $k$ is any integer.\nTeacher：Excellent. You have identified the two possible relationships for the arguments. How did you apply these two cases to your equation?\nStudent：I tried to use $2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$ and $2x - \\pi + \\phi = -\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：Let's examine the first case you set up. What did you get for φ after simplifying the equation `2x - π + φ = 2x - π/6 + 2kπ`?\nStudent：After simplifying, I got $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：The problem states that $-\\pi \\leqslant \\phi<\\pi$. How did you apply this condition to your general solution for $\\phi$?\nStudent：I substituted $k = 0$ to get $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$, which satisfies $-\\pi \\leq \\phi < \\pi$.\nTeacher：That is the correct value for φ from the first case. What did you do with the second case, $A = -B + 2k\\pi$?\nStudent：I solved $2x - \\pi + \\phi = - (2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) + 2k\\pi$, and got $\\phi = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：In the equation for your second case, `2x - π + φ = -(2x - π/6) + 2kπ`, what is the result of moving all terms containing `x` to one side of the equation?\nStudent：After moving all terms with $x$ to one side, I get $2x - \\pi + \\phi + 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6} = 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：When you simplify the equation for the second case, the variable $x$ does not get eliminated. Therefore, this case cannot produce a single constant value for $\\phi$.\nStudent：Oh, I see. That means only $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ from the first case is valid.\nTeacher：Let's revisit your earlier work on the second case. From the equation $2x - \\pi + \\phi = -(2x - \\pi/6) + 2k\\pi$, what was the result of combining the terms containing the variable $x$?\nStudent：After combining, I got $2x - \\pi + \\phi = -2x + \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：That is the correct expansion of the right side. What is the result when you combine the `2x` term from the left with the `-2x` term from the right?",
