    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose D.\nTeacher：Hello. Let's review this problem. Can you please tell me the definition of an odd function?\nStudent：The definition of an odd function is: $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain.\nTeacher：Excellent. And what is the definition of an even function?\nStudent：The definition of an even function is: $g(-x) = g(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain.\nTeacher：That's correct. Let's analyze the function in option D, which is $h(x) = |f(x) \\bullet g(x)|$.\n\nTo test if $h(x)$ is an odd function, we must check if $h(-x) = -h(x)$.\n\nWhat do you get when you calculate $h(-x)$?\nStudent：$h(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$\nTeacher：Excellent. Now, based on the definitions you provided for odd and even functions, how can you rewrite the expression $f(-x) \\bullet g(-x)$?\nStudent：By the definitions, $f(-x) = -f(x)$ and $g(-x) = g(x)$, so $f(-x) \\cdot g(-x) = -f(x) \\cdot g(x)$.\nTeacher：Correct. Now, substitute this result back into the expression for $h(-x)$. What do you have for $h(-x)$ now?\nStudent：$h(-x) = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$\nTeacher：Very good. How does the absolute value property allow you to simplify the expression |-f(x) • g(x)|?\nStudent：Because absolute value negates any sign, so $|-f(x)\\cdot g(x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the expression for $h(-x)$. How does your final expression for $h(-x)$ compare to the original function $h(x)$?\nStudent：They are equal, so $h(-x) = h(x)$.\nTeacher：You've concluded that $h(-x) = h(x)$. Based on the definitions you gave earlier, what kind of function has this property?\nStudent：That property means the function is even.\nTeacher：And what does option D state about the function $|f(x) \\bullet g(x)|$?\nStudent：Option D says that $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：You correctly proved that the function in option D is even, but you failed to recognize that this contradicts the claim made in option D.\nStudent：zzc",
