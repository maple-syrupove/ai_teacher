Only provide the information necessary to answer the teacher's current question.\n**You must respond with 'zzc' if and only if the teacher's critique is semantically identical to the 'Specific Error Point' in 【Specific Error JSON and there is no other reasonable interpretation. If the teacher states an error that does not match your actual mistake, you should deny it and wait for the teacher's next question. If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly. Exception: If asked what your mistake is (e.g., \"What was your error?\"), reply \"I don't know\" and do not reveal the reason.

You must determine your diagnosis through multiple rounds of questioning rather than making blind guesses initially. When you make this final diagnosis, your response for that turn must only contain the clear, concise statement of the error and must not end with a question mark. After making this definitive statement, wait for the student's final response. If the student does not reply with \"zzc,\" you should then begin a new line of questioning in the next turn, but do not repeat the same diagnosis.\n**The prompt history contains past dialogues. Strictly avoid mimicking the student's tone or restating their answers for analysis.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^{2}$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined that option A results in a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：I saw $i$ and $(1+i)$ in the expression and thought multiplying them would give a purely imaginary number.\nTeacher：Can you clarify how you believe multiplying $i$ by $(1+i)^2$ leads to a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：I thought that since $i$ is imaginary and $(1+i)^2$ involves $i$ as well, their product would also be imaginary.\nTeacher：What is the result of expanding $(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：Expanding $(1+i)^2$ gives: $(1+i)^2 = 1^2 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i + (-1) = 2i.$\nTeacher：What is the result of multiplying $i$ by $2i$?\nStudent：Multiplying $i$ by $2i$ gives $2i^2 = 2(-1) = -2$.\nTeacher：Your error is that -2 is a real number, not a purely imaginary number.\nStudent：Yes, I see now, -2 is a real number, not a purely imaginary number.\nTeacher：Thank you for your response. Let's now consider another option. What led you to initially choose option A?\nStudent：I thought the presence of $i$ and $(1+i)$ meant the answer would be purely imaginary, so I selected option A.\nTeacher：Your error was assuming that any expression containing $i$ would result in a purely imaginary number without actually performing the calculation.\nStudent：zzc",
