    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I started by finding the derivative of $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^{2}+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$, but the calculations became too complex. I couldn't get a final answer for $M+m$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you approached finding the derivative?\nStudent：I applied the quotient rule directly, differentiating the numerator $(x+1)^2+\\sin x$ and the denominator $x^2+1$, then tried to simplify the expression, but it got very complicated.\nTeacher：Is there a simpler method you might consider before taking the derivative?\nStudent：I'm not sure. I thought differentiating directly was the standard approach, so I didn't consider other methods.\nTeacher：Let me know if you can identify any symmetry in the function $f(x)$.\nStudent：The function $f(x)$ doesn't appear to have even or odd symmetry, since $\\sin x$ is odd, but the other terms do not match the signs upon substituting $-x$.\nTeacher：Teacher：Can you evaluate $f(x) + f(-x)$ and describe its form?\nStudent：Sure. Calculating $f(x) + f(-x)$, I get:\n$$\nf(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} + \\frac{((-x)+1)^2 + \\sin(-x)}{(-x)^2 + 1}\n$$\nBut the resulting expression still looks complex.\nTeacher：Simplify $f(x) + f(-x)$ further and describe what you find.\nStudent：I tried expanding and combining the terms, but I still ended up with a complicated sum and wasn't sure how to proceed from there.\nTeacher：You did not simplify the sine term correctly.\nStudent：Okay, I see. Should I have written $\\sin(-x)$ as $-\\sin x$ in the expression for $f(-x)$?\nTeacher：Yes.\nStudent：Yes, $\\sin(-x) = -\\sin x$. So for $f(-x)$, the sine term becomes $-\\sin x$.\nTeacher：Correct. Now, simplify the entire expression for $f(x) + f(-x)$ again.\nStudent：So,\n$$\nf(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2+1} + \\frac{(x-1)^2 - \\sin x}{x^2+1}\n$$\nCombining numerators:\n$$\n= \\frac{(x+1)^2 + (x-1)^2 + (\\sin x - \\sin x)}{x^2+1}\n= \\frac{(x+1)^2 + (x-1)^2}{x^2+1}\n$$\nTeacher：The $\\sin x$ terms cancel out, leaving:\n$$\nf(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + (x-1)^2}{x^2+1}\n$$\nNow, expand the squared terms in the numerator.\nStudent：Expanding:\n\\[\n(x+1)^2 + (x-1)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 1) + (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 2x^2 + 2\n\\]\nSo, \n\\[\nf(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{2x^2 + 2}{x^2+1} = 2\n\\]\nTeacher：Therefore, $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $. What does this imply about the relationship between $ M $ and $ m $?\nStudent：Since $f(x) + f(-x) = 2$, the maximum and minimum values, $M$ and $m$, must add up to 2. So, $M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：Your conclusion is incorrect. You assumed that $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $ implies $ M + m = 2 $, which is not necessarily true.\nStudent：I thought that since $f(x) + f(-x) = 2$, the function's maximum and minimum values would sum to 2, so I wrote $M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：The function $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $ does not imply that the maximum and minimum values of $ f(x) $ sum to 2.\nStudent：zzc",
