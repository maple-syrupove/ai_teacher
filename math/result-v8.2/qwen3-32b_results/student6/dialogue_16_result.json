    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I don't know how to solve for $\\phi$ in this situation.\nTeacher：Can you explain how shifting the graph affects the function's equation?\nStudent：Shifting the graph of $y = \\cos(2x+\\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ means replacing $x$ with $x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, making it $y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：Teacher：What is the simplified form of the shifted function?\nStudent：The simplified form is $y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：Teacher：Does this shifted cosine function match the given sine function?\nStudent：No, I don't see how they match directly, and I'm not sure how to proceed from here.\nTeacher：What identity relates cosine and sine that might help compare these expressions?\nStudent：I think of the identity $\\cos \\theta = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta)$, but I'm not sure how to apply it here.\nTeacher：How can you express $ \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) $ using a sine function with the same argument?\nStudent：I guess I could try to write $ \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - (2x - \\pi + \\phi)\\right)$, but I'm not sure how that helps.\nTeacher：What is the simplified form of the expression you obtained on the right-hand side?\nStudent：The simplified form is $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2x + \\pi - \\phi\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2} - 2x - \\phi\\right)$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly simplified the sine function's argument. The transformation does not result in $\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2} - 2x - \\phi\\right)$.\nStudent：Okay, so I need to be more careful in simplifying the argument inside the sine function.\nTeacher：Let me know how you would proceed with the correct simplification.\nStudent：I would write $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - (2x - \\pi + \\phi)\\right)$ and then simplify the inside: $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2x + \\pi - \\phi = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} - 2x - \\phi$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly simplified the sine function's argument. The transformation does not result in $\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2} - 2x - \\phi\\right)$.\nStudent：Okay, I see. Maybe my distribution of the negative sign wasn't done correctly in the argument.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the identity $\\cos \\theta = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta\\right)$.\nStudent：I see, but I still don't know how to convert the shifted cosine function into the same form as the sine function for comparison.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the identity $\\cos \\theta = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta\\right)$.\nStudent：Okay, but I'm not sure what else I could try to match the two functions.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the identity $\\cos \\theta = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta\\right)$.\nStudent：zzc",
