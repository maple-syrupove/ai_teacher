If the teacher states an error that does not match your actual mistake, you should deny it and wait for the teacher's next question. If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly.

When you make this final diagnosis, your response for that turn must only contain the clear, concise statement of the error and must not end with a question mark. After making this definitive statement, wait for the student's final response. If the student does not reply with \"zzc,\" you should then begin a new line of questioning in the next turn, but do not repeat the same diagnosis.\n**The prompt history contains past dialogues. Strictly avoid mimicking the student's tone or restating their answers for analysis.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. $A \\cap B=\\varnothing$\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined that $ A \\cap B $ is empty?\nStudent：Because I thought $A \\cap B$ should be the elements common to both sets, and my computation led me to believe there was no overlap.\nTeacher：Can you share the steps you took to compute set B?\nStudent：I saw $B=\\{x \\mid 3-2x>0\\}$ and didn't change its form. I just kept it like that.\nTeacher：What is the simplified form of the inequality defining set B?\nStudent：The inequality $3 - 2x > 0$ simplifies to $x < \\dfrac{3}{2}$.\nTeacher：So according to your simplification, set B is $\\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2}\\}$. What can you say about the relationship between sets A and B now?\nStudent：Now, both sets are defined by $x < 2$ (for $A$) and $x < \\frac{3}{2}$ (for $B$), so $B$ is a subset of $A$.\nTeacher：Therefore, the intersection $A \\cap B$ cannot be empty.\nStudent：You're right, since all elements of $B$ are also in $A$, the intersection should not be empty.\nTeacher：The intersection $A \\cap B$ cannot be empty because $B$ is a subset of $A$.\nStudent：zzc",
