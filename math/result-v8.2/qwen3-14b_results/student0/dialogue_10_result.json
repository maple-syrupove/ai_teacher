    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the maximum and minimum values by directly differentiating $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^{2}+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$ and setting the derivative equal to zero, but the process became complex and I couldn't finish the calculations, so I was unable to provide the value of $M + m$.\nTeacher：What approach did you take when differentiating $f(x)$? Did you simplify the function before taking the derivative?\nStudent：No, I didn't simplify the function before differentiating. I differentiated $f(x)$ directly in its original form.\nTeacher：Did you consider using the quotient rule for differentiation, or did you attempt another method?\nStudent：I used the quotient rule directly on the original function without simplification.\nTeacher：Did you check if the derivative simplifies to an expression that can be analyzed for critical points, or did you proceed without further simplification?\nStudent：I proceeded without further simplification. I tried to analyze the critical points directly from the complicated derivative.\nTeacher：Your error is that you did not simplify the function before differentiating, which led to unnecessary complexity and made it difficult to find critical points.\nStudent：zzc",
