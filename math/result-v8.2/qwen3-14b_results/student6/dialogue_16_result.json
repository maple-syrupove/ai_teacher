After making this definitive statement, wait for the student's final response. If the student does not reply with \"zzc,\" you should then begin a new line of questioning in the next turn, but do not repeat the same diagnosis.\n**The prompt history contains past dialogues.

I think $\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：What is the relationship between the cosine and sine functions that might help you here?\nStudent：The cosine and sine functions are both periodic and related, but I didn't think of a specific relationship to use.\nTeacher：What is the phase shift between the cosine and sine functions?\nStudent：I'm not sure about the exact phase shift between them, so I didn't apply it.\nTeacher：What is the phase shift required to convert a cosine function into a sine function?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：What is the phase shift required to convert $\\cos(x)$ into $\\sin(x)$?\nStudent：The phase shift required to convert $\\cos(x)$ into $\\sin(x)$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：You mentioned that shifting $\\cos(x)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ gives $\\sin(x)$. However, this is incorrect. What is the actual phase shift required to convert $\\cos(x)$ into $\\sin(x)$?\nStudent：The actual phase shift required is to shift $\\cos(x)$ to the left by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so $\\cos(x) = \\sin(x + \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $\\cos(x) = \\sin(x + \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, but you did not account for the direction of the shift in the given problem.
