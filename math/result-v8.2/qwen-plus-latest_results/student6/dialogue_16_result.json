    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：You mentioned that φ cannot be solved. Let’s examine that. When the function y = cos(2x + φ) is shifted right by π/2, what expression do you get for the new function?\nStudent：After shifting right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the function becomes $y = \\cos\\left(2\\left(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\phi\\right)$.\nTeacher：That is correct. Now simplify the expression inside the cosine: 2(x - π/2) + φ. What does the new function become?\nStudent：The new function becomes $y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the shifted function to $ y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) $. Now, this function is said to coincide with $ y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) $. Recall that sine and cosine are related by a phase shift: $ \\sin\\theta = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta\\right) $ or $ \\sin\\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $. Using this, express $ \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) $ as a cosine function. What is the equivalent cosine expression?\nStudent：$\\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ can be written as $\\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nTeacher：That is correct. Simplifying the expression, $\\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\cos\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)$.  \nSo, the shifted function $y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$ must equal $y = \\cos(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6})$.  \nFor these cosine functions to be identical, their arguments must differ by a multiple of $2\\pi$, or be equal modulo $2\\pi$.  \nThus, $2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.  \nSubtract $2x$ from both sides. What does this give you?  \nStudent: $-\\pi + \\phi = -\\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$.  \nTeacher: Correct. Now solve for $\\phi$. What is the expression for $\\phi$ in terms of $k$?  \nStudent: $\\phi = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$.  \nTeacher: Right. Now recall the constraint: $-\\pi \\leq \\phi < \\pi$. Try $k = 0$: $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$, which is within the interval. Try $k = -1$: $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} - 2\\pi = -\\frac{7\\pi}{6} \\approx -3.67$, which is less than $-\\pi$, so it's invalid. $k = 1$ gives $\\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2\\pi$, which is too large. So only $k = 0$ works.  \nThen $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$. But the student initially said $\\phi$ cannot be solved.  \nThe error is: **The student incorrectly concluded that $\\phi$ cannot be solved, despite the equation yielding a valid solution within the given interval.**\nStudent：That’s not what happened. I just didn’t think of converting the sine to a cosine function.\nTeacher：The error is: **The student failed to recognize that $\\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ can be expressed as a cosine function with a phase shift, which is necessary to compare it directly with the shifted cosine function.**\nStudent：zzc",
