    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is D. $[1,+\\infty)$.\nTeacher：You said the answer is D, [1, ∞). Let's examine that. For a function to be monotonically increasing on (1, ∞), its derivative must be non-negative in that interval. What did you get for f'(x)?\nStudent：I calculated $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}$.\nTeacher：You have f'(x) = k - 1/x. For f to be monotonically increasing on (1, ∞), we need f'(x) ≥ 0 for all x > 1. Since x > 1, what is the behavior of 1/x, and what does that imply about the minimum value of k?\nStudent：Since $x > 1$, $1/x$ will always be less than $1$ and greater than $0$, so the minimum value of $k$ should be $k > 0$.\nTeacher：The error is that you concluded k > 0 is sufficient, but you did not ensure f'(x) ≥ 0 for all x > 1. Specifically, as x approaches 1 from the right, 1/x approaches 1, so k must be at least 1 to ensure f'(x) ≥ 0 near x = 1. However, you failed to consider that k must satisfy f'(x) ≥ 0 for all x > 1, not just some values. The correct condition requires k ≥ 1/x for all x > 1, and since 1/x approaches 1 as x → 1⁺, k must be at least 1. But this is not sufficient because you must guarantee f'(x) ≥ 0 strictly for all x > 1. Your mistake lies in not analyzing the infimum of k over the entire interval.\nStudent：zzc",
