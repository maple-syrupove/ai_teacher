If the teacher states an error that does not match your actual mistake, you should deny it and wait for the teacher's next question.

After making this definitive statement, wait for the student's final response. If the student does not reply with \"zzc,\" you should then begin a new line of questioning in the next turn, but do not repeat the same diagnosis.\n**The prompt history contains past dialogues. Strictly avoid mimicking the student's tone or restating their answers for analysis.

Recall that M requires x to be strictly less than 1.\nStudent：No, 1 is not included in M because x must be less than 1, not equal to 1.\nTeacher：The error is including 1 in the intersection despite 1 not satisfying the condition x < 1.\nStudent：Yes, I understand. 1 should not be included since it's not less than 1.\nTeacher：The error is including 1 in the intersection despite 1 not satisfying the condition x < 1.\nStudent：zzc",
