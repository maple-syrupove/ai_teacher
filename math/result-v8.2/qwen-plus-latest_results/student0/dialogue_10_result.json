    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by directly differentiating the original $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$, but the calculations got complicated and I couldn’t finish to get a specific value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：You're correct that differentiating $ f(x) $ directly leads to a complicated expression. However, the symmetry of the function may help simplify the problem. Consider evaluating $ f(-x) $ and comparing it to $ f(x) $. Have you noticed any relationship between $ f(x) $ and $ f(-x) $?\nStudent：I didn’t check $f(-x)$ before. Let me compute: $f(-x) = \\frac{(1-x)^2+\\sin(-x)}{x^2+1} = \\frac{(x-1)^2-\\sin x}{x^2+1}$.\nTeacher：You correctly computed $ f(-x) = \\frac{(x-1)^2 - \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} $. Now compare this with $ f(x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} $. Consider adding $ f(x) $ and $ f(-x) $. What expression do you obtain?\nStudent：If I add them, I get:\n\\[\nf(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2+1} + \\frac{(x-1)^2 - \\sin x}{x^2+1} = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + (x-1)^2}{x^2+1}\n\\]\nTeacher：You correctly obtained $ f(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + (x-1)^2}{x^2 + 1} $. Now simplify the numerator $ (x+1)^2 + (x-1)^2 $ and see what the resulting expression is.\nStudent：$(x+1)^2 + (x-1)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 1) + (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 2x^2 + 2$\nTeacher：So, $ f(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{2x^2 + 2}{x^2 + 1} = 2 $. This means $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $ for all $ x $. If the function satisfies this symmetry, then whenever $ f(x) $ attains a maximum $ M $, $ f(-x) $ attains a value $ 2 - M $. Therefore, the sum of the maximum and minimum values must be 2. The error is assuming that direct differentiation is the only way, without first exploring symmetry.\nStudent：zzc",
