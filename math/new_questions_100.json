Find the minimum value of $|P Q|$ and the Cartesian coordinates of $P$ at this time.\n",
    "answer": "Solution: (1) For curve $C_1$, we have $\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{3}}=\\cos \\alpha$ and $y=\\sin \\alpha$. Using the identity $\\cos^2\\alpha + \\sin^2\\alpha = 1$, we get $(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{3}})^2 + y^2 = 1$, so the ordinary equation of $C_1$ is the ellipse $\\frac{x^{2}}{3}+y^{2}=1$.\n\nFor curve $C_2$, the polar equation is $\\rho \\sin \\left(\\theta+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=2 \\sqrt{2}$.\nUsing the angle addition formula for sine, we get $\\rho(\\sin\\theta \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\cos\\theta \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n$\\rho(\\sin\\theta \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\cos\\theta \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nMultiplying by $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}$, we get $\\rho\\sin\\theta + \\rho\\cos\\theta = 4$.\nUsing the conversions $x = \\rho\\cos\\theta$ and $y = \\rho\\sin\\theta$, the Cartesian equation of $C_2$ is the line $x+y-4=0$.\n\n(2) The problem asks for the minimum distance between a point $P$ on the ellipse $C_1$ and a point $Q$ on the line $C_2$. This minimum distance is the distance from a point on the ellipse to the line, minimized. This minimum distance occurs along a normal to the ellipse that is also perpendicular to the line $x+y-4=0$. This is equivalent to finding the tangent to the ellipse that is parallel to the line $x+y-4=0$.\n\nLet the line parallel to $x+y-4=0$ be $x+y+t=0$. We want to find the value of $t$ for which this line is tangent to the ellipse $\\frac{x^2}{3} + y^2 = 1$.\nSubstitute $y = -x-t$ into the ellipse equation:\n$x^2 + 3(-x-t)^2 = 3$\n$x^2 + 3(x^2 + 2xt + t^2) = 3$\n$4x^2 + 6tx + 3t^2 - 3 = 0$.\nFor the line to be tangent, this quadratic in $x$ must have exactly one solution, so the discriminant must be zero.\n$\\Delta = (6t)^2 - 4(4)(3t^2 - 3) = 0$\n$36t^2 - 16(3t^2 - 3) = 0$\n$36t^2 - 48t^2 + 48 = 0$\n$-12t^2 = -48$\n$t^2 = 4$, so $t = \\pm 2$.\n\nThe two parallel tangent lines are $x+y+2=0$ and $x+y-2=0$.\nThe distance between the line $C_2: x+y-4=0$ and the tangent line $x+y-2=0$ is $d_1 = \\frac{|-4 - (-2)|}{\\sqrt{1^2+1^2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nThe distance between $C_2$ and the tangent line $x+y+2=0$ is $d_2 = \\frac{|-4 - 2|}{\\sqrt{1^2+1^2}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe minimum distance $|PQ|$ is the smaller of these, which is $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThis minimum distance occurs at the point of tangency $P$ for the line $x+y-2=0$. To find the coordinates of $P$, we use the tangency condition with $t=-2$ in the quadratic equation for $x$: \n$4x^2 + 6(-2)x + 3(-2)^2 - 3 = 0$\n$4x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0$\n$(2x-3)^2 = 0$\nSo, $x = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nSince $P$ is on the line $x+y-2=0$, $y = 2 - x = 2 - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe coordinates of $P$ are $(\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n\nAlternative solution:\nLet $P$ be a point on the ellipse, with parametric coordinates $P(\\sqrt{3} \\cos \\alpha, \\sin \\alpha)$.\nThe distance from $P$ to the line $x+y-4=0$ is given by the formula:\n$d = \\frac{|\\sqrt{3} \\cos \\alpha + \\sin \\alpha - 4|}{\\sqrt{1^2+1^2}} = \\frac{|\\sqrt{3} \\cos \\alpha + \\sin \\alpha - 4|}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nUsing the R-formula, we can write $\\sqrt{3} \\cos \\alpha + \\sin \\alpha = 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos\\alpha + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\alpha) = 2(\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\cos\\alpha + \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\sin\\alpha) = 2\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$.\nSo, $d = \\frac{|2\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) - 4|}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nTo minimize $d$, we need to maximize the value of $2\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$, since the term is subtracted from 4 inside the absolute value. The maximum value of $\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$ is 1.\nWhen $\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) = 1$, the minimum distance is $d_{min} = \\frac{|2(1) - 4|}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{|-2|}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nThis occurs when $\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which gives $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$.\nThe coordinates of $P$ are then:\n$x = \\sqrt{3} \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$\n$y = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, the point $P$ is $(\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n",

The minimum value is $|a-1|$.\nSo, for the inequality to hold for all $x$, the minimum value of the left-hand side must be greater than or equal to the right-hand side.\nMinimum value of $(|2 x-a| + |2 x-1|) = |a-1|$.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$|a-1| \\geqslant 3-a$\n\nWe consider two cases based on the expression inside the absolute value:\n\nCase 1: $a-1 \\geqslant 0$, which means $a \\geqslant 1$.\nThe inequality becomes $a-1 \\geqslant 3-a$.\n$2a \\geqslant 4$\n$a \\geqslant 2$.\nCombining with the case condition ($a \\geqslant 1$), the solution for this case is $a \\geqslant 2$.\n\nCase 2: $a-1 < 0$, which means $a < 1$.\nThe inequality becomes $-(a-1) \\geqslant 3-a$.\n$-a+1 \\geqslant 3-a$\n$1 \\geqslant 3$.\nThis is a contradiction, so there are no solutions in this case.\n\nCombining the results from both cases, the range of values for $a$ is $[2, +\\infty)$.\n\nAlternative analysis for the inequality $|a-1| \\geqslant 3-a$:\nIf the right side $3-a$ is negative (i.e., $a>3$), the inequality holds because the left side is always non-negative. So $a>3$ is part of the solution.\nIf the right side $3-a$ is non-negative (i.e., $a \\le 3$), we can square both sides:\n$(a-1)^2 \\geqslant (3-a)^2$\n$a^2 - 2a + 1 \\geqslant 9 - 6a + a^2$\n$4a \\geqslant 8$\n$a \\geqslant 2$.\nCombining this with the condition for this part ($a \\le 3$), we get $2 \\le a \\le 3$.\nCombining the two parts of the solution ($a>3$ and $2 \\le a \\le 3$), the total range of values for $a$ is $[2, +\\infty)$.",
    "analysis": "(1) When $a=2$, substitute this value into the function $f(x)$ and the inequality. Solve the resulting absolute value inequality $|2x-2| \\le 4$ to find the solution set.\n\n(2) Substitute the expressions for $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ into the given inequality $f(x)+g(x) \\geqslant 3$. This leads to $|2x-1| + |2x-a| \\geqslant 3-a$. For this inequality to hold for all real numbers $x$, the minimum value of the left-hand side must be greater than or equal to the right-hand side. The minimum value of $|2x-1| + |2x-a|$ can be found using the triangle inequality, which is $|a-1|$. This reduces the problem to solving the inequality $|a-1| \\geqslant 3-a$ for $a$. This can be solved by considering cases or by squaring both sides (if the right side is non-negative).",

The angle $\\frac{1}{4}$ is in radians and lies in the first quadrant $(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\n\n**Step 1: Compare c and b.**\nLet's consider the ratio $\\frac{c}{b} = \\frac{4 \\sin(1/4)}{\\cos(1/4)} = 4 \\tan(\\frac{1}{4})$.\nFor any $x \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, we have the well-known inequality $\\tan x > x$.\nApplying this for $x = \\frac{1}{4}$, we get $\\tan(\\frac{1}{4}) > \\frac{1}{4}$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{c}{b} = 4 \\tan(\\frac{1}{4}) > 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\nSince $b = \\cos(\\frac{1}{4}) > 0$ in the first quadrant, we can conclude from $\\frac{c}{b} > 1$ that $c > b$.\n\n**Step 2: Compare b and a.**\nWe need to compare $b = \\cos(\\frac{1}{4})$ with $a = \\frac{31}{32}$.\nWe can use calculus to prove an inequality. Let's define a function $f(x) = \\cos x - (1 - \\frac{x^2}{2})$.\nThe derivative is $f'(x) = -\\sin x + x$.\nFor $x > 0$, we know that $x > \\sin x$, so $f'(x) = x - \\sin x > 0$.\nThis means that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function for $x > 0$.\nTherefore, for any $x > 0$, $f(x) > f(0)$.\n$f(0) = \\cos(0) - (1 - 0) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\nSo, for $x > 0$, we have $f(x) > 0$, which means $\\cos x - (1 - \\frac{x^2}{2}) > 0$, or $\\cos x > 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2}$.\nLet's apply this for $x = \\frac{1}{4}$:\n$b = \\cos(\\frac{1}{4}) > 1 - \\frac{(1/4)^2}{2} = 1 - \\frac{1/16}{2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{31}{32}$.\nSo, $b > a$.\n(The analysis in the prompt uses a slightly different but equivalent function $f(x)=\\cos x+\\frac{1}{2} x^{2}-1$, which also works).\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\nFrom Step 1, we found $c > b$.\nFrom Step 2, we found $b > a$.\nCombining these two inequalities, we get the final order: $c > b > a$.\n\nThus, the correct option is A.",

    "question": "14. If the asymptotes of the hyperbola $y^{2}-\\frac{x^{2}}{m^{2}}=1(m>0)$ are tangent to the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}-4 y+3=0$, then\n\n$m=$\n",
    "answer": "$\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$\n",
    "analysis": "【Detailed Explanation】Solution:\nFirst, let's find the equations of the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The given hyperbola is $y^{2}-\\frac{x^{2}}{m^{2}}=1$. This is a vertical hyperbola. The equations of its asymptotes are found by replacing the 1 with 0: $y^2 - \\frac{x^2}{m^2} = 0$, which gives $y = \\pm \\frac{1}{m}x$. These can be rewritten as $y \\mp \\frac{1}{m}x = 0$, or $my \\mp x = 0$.\nSo the two asymptote lines are $x - my = 0$ and $x + my = 0$.\n\nNext, let's find the center and radius of the circle. The equation is $x^{2}+y^{2}-4 y+3=0$. We complete the square for the y-terms:\n$x^2 + (y^2 - 4y + 4) - 4 + 3 = 0$\n$x^2 + (y-2)^2 = 1$\nThis is the equation of a circle with center at $(0, 2)$ and radius $r=1$.\n\nThe problem states that the asymptotes are tangent to the circle. This means the distance from the center of the circle to each asymptote line must be equal to the radius.\nLet's use the asymptote line $x + my = 0$ and the center $(0, 2)$. The distance $d$ from a point $(x_0, y_0)$ to a line $Ax+By+C=0$ is $d = \\frac{|Ax_0+By_0+C|}{\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}$.\n$d = \\frac{|1(0) + m(2)|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + m^2}} = \\frac{|2m|}{\\sqrt{1+m^2}}$.\n\nWe set this distance equal to the radius, $r=1$:\n$\\frac{|2m|}{\\sqrt{1+m^2}} = 1$\n$|2m| = \\sqrt{1+m^2}$\nSquare both sides:\n$(2m)^2 = 1+m^2$\n$4m^2 = 1+m^2$\n$3m^2 = 1$\n$m^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$\nSince we are given that $m > 0$, we take the positive square root:\n$m = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n\nThus, the answer is: $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.",

(12 points) In the Cartesian coordinate system $xOy$, the curve $C: y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}$ intersects the line $l: y=k x+a(a>0)$ at two points M and N.\n\n(I) When $k=0$, find the equations of the tangent lines to C at points M and N respectively.\n\n(II) Does there exist a point P on the y-axis such that for any value of k, we always have $\\angle O P M=\\angle O P N$? (Explain your reasoning)\n",
    "answer": "Solution: (I) When $k=0$, the line equation becomes $l: y=a$.\nTo find the intersection points M and N, we solve the system:\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y=a \\\\ y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\end{array}\\right.$\nThis gives $\\frac{x^2}{4} = a$, so $x^2 = 4a$, which means $x = \\pm 2\\sqrt{a}$.\nWithout loss of generality, let $M$ be the point with the positive x-coordinate. So, the coordinates are $M(2 \\sqrt{a}, a)$ and $N(-2 \\sqrt{a}, a)$.\n\nThe derivative of the curve $C: y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}$ is $y' = \\frac{2x}{4} = \\frac{x}{2}$.\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at M is $y'|_{x=2\\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{a}}{2} = \\sqrt{a}$.\nThe equation of the tangent line at M is $y - a = \\sqrt{a}(x - 2\\sqrt{a})$.\n$y - a = \\sqrt{a}x - 2a$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{a}x - y - a = 0$.\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at N is $y'|_{x=-2\\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{-2\\sqrt{a}}{2} = -\\sqrt{a}$.\nThe equation of the tangent line at N is $y - a = -\\sqrt{a}(x - (-2\\sqrt{a}))$.\n$y - a = -\\sqrt{a}x - 2a$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{a}x + y + 3a = 0$.

It should be $y-a = -\\sqrt{a}(x+2\\sqrt{a}) \\implies y-a = -\\sqrt{a}x - 2a \\implies \\sqrt{a}x + y + a = 0$). Let's use the correct one: $\\sqrt{a}x + y + a = 0$.\n\n(II) Yes, such a point exists. The point is $P(0, -a)$.\nLet $P$ be a point $(0, b)$ on the y-axis. Let the intersection points be $M(x_1, y_1)$ and $N(x_2, y_2)$. The condition $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ (where O is the origin) means that the line segment OP (which is on the y-axis) is the angle bisector of $\\angle MPN$. This implies that the angles that PM and PN make with the y-axis are equal. This is equivalent to saying that the slopes of PM and PN are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign (i.e., $k_{PM} = -k_{PN}$, or $k_{PM} + k_{PN} = 0$), assuming M and N are on opposite sides of the y-axis (which they are, as we will see).\n\nLet's find the intersection points by solving the system:\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y=kx+a \\\\ y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\end{array}\\right.$\n$\frac{x^2}{4} = kx+a \\implies x^2 - 4kx - 4a = 0$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum and product of the roots are: $x_1 + x_2 = 4k$ and $x_1x_2 = -4a$.\nSince $a>0$, $x_1x_2$ is negative, meaning one root is positive and one is negative, so M and N are on opposite sides of the y-axis.\n\nThe slopes of PM and PN are $k_{PM} = \\frac{y_1-b}{x_1}$ and $k_{PN} = \\frac{y_2-b}{x_2}$.\nWe require $k_{PM} + k_{PN} = 0$.\n$\\frac{y_1-b}{x_1} + \\frac{y_2-b}{x_2} = 0$\n$\\frac{x_2(y_1-b) + x_1(y_2-b)}{x_1x_2} = 0$\n$x_2y_1 - bx_2 + x_1y_2 - bx_1 = 0$\nSubstitute $y_1 = kx_1+a$ and $y_2 = kx_2+a$:\n$x_2(kx_1+a) - bx_2 + x_1(kx_2+a) - bx_1 = 0$\n$kx_1x_2 + ax_2 - bx_2 + kx_1x_2 + ax_1 - bx_1 = 0$\n$2k(x_1x_2) + (a-b)(x_1+x_2) = 0$\nNow substitute the values from Vieta's formulas:\n$2k(-4a) + (a-b)(4k) = 0$\n$-8ak + 4k(a-b) = 0$\nSince this must hold for any value of $k$, we can divide by $4k$ (assuming $k \neq 0$. If $k=0$, the condition holds trivially as the setup is symmetric).\n$-2a + (a-b) = 0$\n$-a - b = 0$\n$b = -a$\n\nThus, the point P must be $(0, -a)$. This point is independent of $k$. Therefore, such a point exists, and its coordinates are $(0, -a)$.",

Finally, use the point-slope form to write the equations of the tangent lines.\n\n(II) Yes, such a point $P(0, -a)$ exists. Assume a general point $P(0, b)$ on the y-axis. The condition $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ implies that the slopes of the lines PM and PN must sum to zero ($k_{PM} + k_{PN} = 0$). Set up the equations for the intersection of the line and the parabola, and use Vieta's formulas for the sum and product of the roots ($x_1+x_2$ and $x_1x_2$). Express $k_{PM} + k_{PN}$ in terms of the roots, and then substitute the expressions from Vieta's formulas. For the sum of the slopes to be zero for all $k$, a condition on $b$ will emerge.

A property of circles is that the line from the center to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord. Thus, $OD \\perp BC$, which means $OD \\perp PD$. So, $\\triangle ODP$ is a right-angled triangle with $\\angle ODP = 90^{\\circ}$.\n\n3.  **Set up for maximization**: We want to maximize $\\overrightarrow{PA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{PD}$. By definition, $\\overrightarrow{PA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{PD} = |PA||PD|\\cos(\\angle APD)$. We know $|PA|=1$. So we need to maximize $|PD|\\cos(\\angle APD)$.\n\n4.  **Introduce an angle variable**: Let $\\angle OPD = \\alpha$. We know $\\angle APO = 45^{\\circ}$. So, the angle we need, $\\angle APD$, can be expressed as $\\theta = |45^{\\circ} - \\alpha|$. We assume D lies such that $\\angle APD = 45^{\\circ} - \\alpha$. (The other case leads to the same result).\n\n5.  **Express terms using the variable**: In the right-angled $\\triangle ODP$, we have $|PD| = |PO|\\cos(\\alpha) = \\sqrt{2}\\cos\\alpha$. \nThe term $\\cos(\\angle APD) = \\cos(45^{\\circ} - \\alpha)$. Using the angle subtraction formula: $\\cos(45^{\\circ} - \\alpha) = \\cos 45^{\\circ}\\cos\\alpha + \\sin 45^{\\circ}\\sin\\alpha = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(\\cos\\alpha + \\sin\\alpha)$.\n\n6.  **Formulate the expression to maximize**: \n$\\overrightarrow{PA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{PD} = |PA||PD|\\cos(\\angle APD) = (1) \\cdot (\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\alpha) \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(\\cos\\alpha + \\sin\\alpha)$\n$= (\\cos\\alpha)(\\cos\\alpha + \\sin\\alpha) = \\cos^2\\alpha + \\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$.\n\n7.  **Maximize the expression**: To maximize this trigonometric expression, we use double angle identities:\n$\\cos^2\\alpha = \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\alpha)}{2}$\n$\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha = \\frac{\\sin(2\\alpha)}{2}$\nSo, $\\overrightarrow{PA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{PD} = \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\alpha)}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2\\alpha)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\alpha) + \\sin(2\\alpha))$.\nTo maximize this, we need to maximize $\\sin(2\\alpha) + \\cos(2\\alpha)$. Using the R-formula, $A\\sin x + B\\cos x = R\\sin(x+\\phi)$:\n$\\sin(2\\alpha) + \\cos(2\\alpha) = \\sqrt{1^2+1^2}\\sin(2\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\sqrt{2}\\sin(2\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$.\nThe maximum value of this is $\\sqrt{2}$, which occurs when $\\sin(2\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})=1$.\n\nSubstituting this maximum value back into the expression for the dot product:\n$(\\overrightarrow{PA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{PD})_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\nThus, the correct option is A.",

The domain of f(x) is $(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, +\\infty)$.\nUsing the quotient rule and product rule: $f'(x) = \\left(\\frac{(1)(x+2) - (x-2)(1)}{(x+2)^2}\\right)e^x + \\left(\\frac{x-2}{x+2}\\right)e^x = \\left(\\frac{4}{(x+2)^2} + \\frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{(x+2)^2}\\right)e^x$\n$f'(x) = \\frac{4 + x^2 - 4}{(x+2)^2}e^x = \\frac{x^2 e^x}{(x+2)^2}$.\nSince $x^2 \\ge 0$, $e^x > 0$, and $(x+2)^2 > 0$ for $x \\neq -2$, we have $f'(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$ in the domain. The derivative is 0 only at $x=0$. \nTherefore, $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing on $(-\\infty, -2)$ and on $(-2, +\\infty)$.\n\nTo prove the inequality for $x>0$: since $f(x)$ is increasing on $(-2, +\\infty)$, for any $x>0$, we have $f(x) > f(0)$.\n$f(0) = \\frac{0-2}{0+2}e^0 = \\frac{-2}{2}(1) = -1$.\nSo, for $x>0$, we have $\\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x > -1$. \nMultiplying by $(x+2)$ (which is positive for $x>0$):\n$(x-2)e^x > -(x+2)$\n$(x-2)e^x + x+2 > 0$. The proof is complete.\n\n(II) To find the minimum of $g(x)$, we find its derivative $g'(x)$ for $x>0$.\n$g'(x) = \\frac{(e^x-a)(x^2) - (e^x-ax-a)(2x)}{x^4} = \\frac{x(e^x-a) - 2(e^x-ax-a)}{x^3}$\n$g'(x) = \\frac{xe^x - ax - 2e^x + 2ax + 2a}{x^3} = \\frac{(x-2)e^x + ax + 2a}{x^3}$\n$g'(x) = \\frac{(x+2)(\\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x + a)}{x^3}$.\nSince $x>0$, the sign of $g'(x)$ is determined by the sign of the term $G(x) = \\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x + a = f(x)+a$.\n\nFrom part (I), $f(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x>0$. Also, $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(x) = f(0) = -1$ and $\\lim_{x\\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$. So, for $x>0$, the range of $f(x)$ is $(-1, \\infty)$.\nWe are looking for roots of $G(x)=0$, which is $f(x) = -a$. \nSince $a \\in [0, 1)$, we have $-a \\in (-1, 0]$. Since $-a$ is in the range of $f(x)$ for $x>0$, and $f(x)$ is strictly increasing, there exists a unique solution $t>0$ such that $f(t)=-a$.\n\n- When $0 < x < t$, $f(x) < f(t) = -a$, so $G(x) < 0$, which means $g'(x) < 0$. Thus, $g(x)$ is decreasing.\n- When $x > t$, $f(x) > f(t) = -a$, so $G(x) > 0$, which means $g'(x) > 0$. Thus, $g(x)$ is increasing.\nThis confirms that $g(x)$ has a unique minimum value at $x=t$. The minimum value is $h(a) = g(t) = \\frac{e^t-at-a}{t^2}$.\n\nTo find the range of $h(a)$, we express it in terms of $t$. From $f(t)=-a$, we have $a = -f(t) = -\\frac{t-2}{t+2}e^t$.\nSubstitute $a$ into the expression for $h(a)$:\n$h(a) = \\frac{e^t - (t+1)a}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t + (t+1)\\frac{t-2}{t+2}e^t}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(1 + \\frac{t^2-t-2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(\\frac{t+2+t^2-t-2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(\\frac{t^2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$.\n\nSo, the minimum value is a function of $t$: $h(a) = k(t) = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$.\nWe need to find the range of $k(t)$ for the possible values of $t$. \n$t$ is defined by $f(t) = -a$, where $a \\in [0, 1)$. This means $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$. \nWe need to find the values of $t>0$ for which $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$.\n$f(0)=-1$, and $f(2)=0$. Since $f(x)$ is increasing for $x>0$, $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$ corresponds to $t \\in (0, 2]$.\n\nNow we find the range of $k(t) = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$ for $t \\in (0, 2]$.\n$k'(t) = \\frac{e^t(t+2) - e^t(1)}{(t+2)^2} = \\frac{e^t(t+1)}{(t+2)^2}$.\nFor $t>0$, $e^t>0$, $t+1>0$, and $(t+2)^2 > 0$, so $k'(t) > 0$. \nThus, $k(t)$ is strictly increasing on $(0, 2]$.\nThe range of $k(t)$ is therefore $(k(0), k(2)]$.\n$k(0) = \\frac{e^0}{0+2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$k(2) = \\frac{e^2}{2+2} = \\frac{e^2}{4}$.\nThe range of $h(a)$ is $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{e^2}{4}]$.\n",
    "analysis": "The problem is solved in two parts. (I) To discuss monotonicity, compute the first derivative $f'(x)$. Analyzing the sign of $f'(x)$ reveals the intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing. This monotonicity property is then used to prove the inequality by comparing $f(x)$ for $x>0$ to its value at $x=0$. (II) To find the minimum of $g(x)$, its derivative $g'(x)$ is computed. The sign of $g'(x)$ is shown to depend on a function related to $f(x)$ from part (I). By analyzing where the derivative is zero, we find the point $t$ of the minimum. The minimum value, $h(a)=g(t)$, is then expressed as a function of $t$. The range of $t$ is determined from the given range of $a$.

So $|2x+1|=2x+1$ and $|2x-1|=1-2x$.\n$f(x) = \\ln(2x+1) - \\ln(1-2x)$.\nThis is a sum of two increasing functions: $y_1 = \\ln(2x+1)$ is increasing, and $y_2 = -\\ln(1-2x)$ is also increasing (as $\\ln(1-2x)$ is decreasing). \nTherefore, $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing on $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.

A larger standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be further from the mean.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the mean for each case. The mean (expected value) is $\\bar{x} = \\sum x_i p_i$.\nFor all four options, the frequencies are symmetric ($p_1=p_4, p_2=p_3$). Let's check the mean for option A:\n$\\bar{x}_{A} = 1(0.1) + 2(0.4) + 3(0.4) + 4(0.1) = 0.1 + 0.8 + 1.2 + 0.4 = 2.5$.\nDue to the symmetry, the mean will be 2.5 for all four cases.\n\nTo maximize the standard deviation (or variance), we want the data to be as far from the mean (2.5) as possible. This means we want to give the highest frequencies (probabilities) to the values that are furthest from 2.5, which are 1 and 4.

    "analysis": "【Detailed Explanation】Let's find the volume of the pyramid $P-ABC$. The volume is given by $V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (\\text{Area of base}) \\times (\\text{Height})$.\n\nThe base is $\\triangle ABC$, an equilateral triangle with side length 2. Its area is $A_{base} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(2^2) = \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe main challenge is to find the height of the pyramid from vertex P to the base ABC.\n\nLet's consider the geometry. Let E be the midpoint of the side AB. Connect PE and CE.\nIn $\\triangle PAB$, since $PA=PB=2$, it is an isosceles triangle. PE is the median to the base, so it is also the altitude. Thus, $PE \\perp AB$. Also, $AE=EB=1$. In right $\\triangle PEB$, $PE = \\sqrt{PB^2 - EB^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1^2} = \\sqrt{3}$.\nIn the base $\\triangle ABC$, since it's an equilateral triangle of side 2, CE is the altitude. Thus, $CE \\perp AB$. Its length is $CE = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(2) = \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nSince $AB$ is perpendicular to both PE and CE, and PE and CE lie in the plane PEC and intersect at E, AB must be perpendicular to the plane PEC. \n\nNow consider $\\triangle PEC$. We have side lengths $PE=\\sqrt{3}$, $CE=\\sqrt{3}$, and $PC=\\sqrt{6}$.\nLet's check if this is a right-angled triangle: $PE^2 + CE^2 = (\\sqrt{3})^2 + (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 3+3=6$. \nAnd $PC^2 = (\\sqrt{6})^2 = 6$. \nSince $PE^2+CE^2=PC^2$, $\\triangle PEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at E, so $PE \\perp CE$.\n\nThis gives us a very useful structure. Since $AB \\perp$ plane PEC, we can think of the pyramid as being composed of two smaller pyramids, $B-PEC$ and $A-PEC$, with a common base $\\triangle PEC$ and heights BE and AE respectively.\n\nVolume($P-ABC$) = Volume($B-PEC$) + Volume($A-PEC$)\n$= \\frac{1}{3} \\times Area(\\triangle PEC) \\times BE + \\frac{1}{3} \\times Area(\\triangle PEC) \\times AE$\n$= \\frac{1}{3} \\times Area(\\triangle PEC) \\times (BE+AE)$\n$= \\frac{1}{3} \\times Area(\\triangle PEC) \\times AB$.\n\nThe area of the right-angled $\\triangle PEC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times PE \\times CE = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nThe length of AB is 2.\n\nSo, the total volume is $V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (\\frac{3}{2}) \\times 2 = 1$.\n\nThus, the correct option is A.",

The sum of the first n terms is $S_n = na_1 + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}d$. \nThe sequence in statement B has terms $b_n = \\frac{S_n}{n}$.\n$b_n = \\frac{na_1 + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}d}{n} = a_1 + \\frac{n-1}{2}d = (\\frac{d}{2})n + (a_1 - \\frac{d}{2})$.\nThis is a linear function of n. To check if $\\{b_n\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence, we find the difference between consecutive terms: $b_{n+1} - b_n = (\\frac{d}{2})(n+1) + (a_1 - \\frac{d}{2}) - [(\\frac{d}{2})n + (a_1 - \\frac{d}{2})] = \\frac{d}{2}$.\nSince the difference is a constant (d/2), $\\{\\frac{S_n}{n}\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence. So, A is a sufficient condition for B.\n\nNow let's prove that B implies A (A is necessary for B).\nIf $\\{\\frac{S_n}{n}\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence, let its common difference be $k$. \nThen $\\frac{S_{n+1}}{n+1} - \\frac{S_n}{n} = k$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nAlso, $\\frac{S_n}{n} - \\frac{S_{n-1}}{n-1} = k$ for $n \\ge 2$.\nFrom the first equation, $S_{n+1} = (n+1)(\\frac{S_n}{n} + k)$.\nWe know $a_{n+1} = S_{n+1} - S_n = (n+1)(\\frac{S_n}{n} + k) - S_n = \\frac{(n+1)S_n}{n} + k(n+1) - S_n = \\frac{S_n}{n} + k(n+1)$.\nSo, $a_{n+1} = b_n + k(n+1)$.\nSimilarly, for $n \\ge 2$, $a_n = b_{n-1} + kn$. \nLet's find the difference $a_{n+1} - a_n = (b_n + k(n+1)) - (b_{n-1} + kn) = (b_n - b_{n-1}) + k = k+k = 2k$.\nThis shows that the difference between consecutive terms of $\\{a_n\\}$ is a constant, $2k$, for $n \\ge 2$. \nWe need to check if $a_2 - a_1 = 2k$. $a_1 = S_1 = b_1$. $a_2 = S_2 - S_1 = 2b_2 - b_1$. $a_2-a_1 = 2b_2 - 2b_1 = 2(b_2-b_1) = 2k$. \nSo, $\\{a_n\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with common difference $2k$.

    "answer": "【Solution】\n(1) We are given the equation $\\cos^2(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+A) + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$.\nUsing the co-function identity $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+A) = -\\sin A$, the equation becomes:\n$(-\\sin A)^2 + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$\n$\\sin^2 A + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$.\nUsing the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2 A = 1 - \\cos^2 A$:\n$(1 - \\cos^2 A) + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$.\nRearrange into a standard quadratic form in terms of $\\cos A$:\n$\\cos^2 A - \\cos A + \\frac{5}{4} - 1 = 0$\n$\\cos^2 A - \\cos A + \\frac{1}{4} = 0$.\nThis is a perfect square trinomial: $(\\cos A - \\frac{1}{2})^2 = 0$.\nThis gives $\\cos A = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince A is an angle in a triangle, $0 < A < \\pi$. The angle A for which $\\cos A = 1/2$ is $A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\n(2) From part (1), we have $A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, so $\\cos A = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFrom the Law of Cosines, we know $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A$.\nSubstituting $\\cos A = 1/2$, we get $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc(\\frac{1}{2})$, which simplifies to:\n$a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$ (Equation 1).\n\nWe are given the condition $b-c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}a$. We can write this as $a = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3}}(b-c) = \\sqrt{3}(b-c)$.\nNow, substitute this expression for $a$ into Equation 1:\n$(\\sqrt{3}(b-c))^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$\n$3(b-c)^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$\n$3(b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = b^2 + c^2 - bc$\n$3b^2 - 6bc + 3c^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$\n$2b^2 - 5bc + 2c^2 = 0$.\n\nThis is a quadratic-like equation in terms of b and c. We can factor it. Divide by $c^2$ (assuming $c\\neq 0$):\n$2(\\frac{b}{c})^2 - 5(\\frac{b}{c}) + 2 = 0$.\nLet $x = b/c$. The equation is $2x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0$. \nFactoring gives $(2x-1)(x-2)=0$.\nSo, $x = 1/2$ or $x=2$. This means $\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{1}{2}$ (i.e., $c=2b$) or $\\frac{b}{c} = 2$ (i.e., $b=2c$).\n\nLet's check these with the condition $b-c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}a > 0$ (since a, b, c are side lengths, and if $b=c$, $a=0$, which is impossible). So $b>c$. This means we must have $b=2c$.\n\nNow we have the relationship between the three sides: $b=2c$. Let's find $a$ in terms of $c$.\n$a = \\sqrt{3}(b-c) = \\sqrt{3}(2c-c) = \\sqrt{3}c$.\nSo, the sides are $a=\\sqrt{3}c$, $b=2c$, and $c$.\n\nLet's check if they satisfy the Pythagorean theorem:\n$a^2 + c^2 = (\\sqrt{3}c)^2 + c^2 = 3c^2 + c^2 = 4c^2$.\n$b^2 = (2c)^2 = 4c^2$.\nSince $a^2 + c^2 = b^2$, the triangle is a right-angled triangle, with the right angle at B.\nTherefore, $\\triangle ABC$ is a right-angled triangle.",

    "analysis": "【Detailed Explanation】Since $f(x)$ is an even function, $f(-x) = f(x)$. This allows us to evaluate the function at the absolute value of its argument if we are considering its behavior on $(0, +\\infty)$.\nWe are given that $f(x)$ is monotonically decreasing on $(0, +\\infty)$. This means that for any two positive numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$, if $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$.\n\nLet's analyze the arguments of the function in the options. Note that the question in the analysis has $\\log_3$ while the question has $\\log_5$. Let's assume the question is correct with $\\log_5$.\n\nArgument 1: $\\log_{5} \\frac{1}{4} = \\log_5(4^{-1}) = -\\log_5 4$. Since $f$ is even, $f(\\log_5 \\frac{1}{4}) = f(-\\log_5 4) = f(\\log_5 4)$. We need to compare the positive value $\\log_5 4$.\n\nArgument 2: $2^{-\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2^{3/2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}$. This is a positive number.\n\nArgument 3: $2^{-\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{1}{2^{2/3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}$. This is a positive number.\n\nNow we need to compare the magnitudes of the arguments: $\\log_5 4$, $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}$, and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}$.\n\n- Compare $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}$ and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}$. This is equivalent to comparing $\\sqrt{8}$ and $\\sqrt[3]{4}$. Let's raise them to the 6th power: $(\\sqrt{8})^6 = 8^3 = 512$. $(\\sqrt[3]{4})^6 = 4^2 = 16$. Since $512 > 16$, we have $\\sqrt{8} > \\sqrt[3]{4}$, which means $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}} < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}$. So, $2^{-3/2} < 2^{-2/3}$.\n\n- Compare $\\log_5 4$ with the others. We know $\\log_5 1 = 0$ and $\\log_5 5 = 1$. So $0 < \\log_5 4 < 1$. Also, $2^{-2/3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}$. Since $1 < \\sqrt[3]{4} < 2$, we have $\\frac{1}{2} < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}} < 1$. To be more precise, $\\log_5 4$ is about 0.86. $2^{-2/3}$ is about $1/1.587 \\approx 0.63$. So $\\log_5 4 > 2^{-2/3}$. Let's prove it: we compare $4$ and $5^{2^{-2/3}} = 5^{1/\\sqrt[3]{4}}$. This is difficult. Let's compare $\\log_5 4$ with 1. It's less than 1. Let's compare $2^{-2/3}$ with 1. It's less than 1. Let's compare $\\log_5 4$ and $2^{-2/3}$. It seems $\\log_5 4 > 2^{-2/3}$. Let's re-examine the original analysis which uses $\\log_3$. If it was $\\log_3(1/4)$, then we compare $\\log_3 4$. Since $3^1 < 4 < 3^2$, we have $1 < \\log_3 4 < 2$. We have $2^{-3/2} < 2^{-2/3} < 1$. So we have the order of positive arguments: $2^{-3/2} < 2^{-2/3} < 1 < \\log_3 4$. \nLet's assume the question intended $\\log_3(1/4)$.\n\nSo we have the order of positive arguments: $x_1 = 2^{-3/2}$, $x_2 = 2^{-2/3}$, $x_3 = \\log_3 4$. We have $x_1 < x_2 < x_3$. \nSince $f(x)$ is decreasing on $(0, +\\infty)$, the function values will be in the reverse order:\n$f(x_1) > f(x_2) > f(x_3)$.\n$f(2^{-3/2}) > f(2^{-2/3}) > f(\\log_3 4)$.\nSince $f$ is even, $f(\\log_3 4) = f(\\log_3(1/4))$.\nSo, $f(2^{-3/2}) > f(2^{-2/3}) > f(\\log_3(1/4))$.\nThis matches option C.\n\nThus, assuming the typo, the correct option is C.",

    "answer": "Solution:\n(1) From the survey of 500 elderly people, the total number who need volunteer help is $40 (male) + 30 (female) = 70$.\nThe estimated proportion of elderly people in the area who need help is the sample proportion: $\\frac{70}{500} = \\frac{7}{50} = 0.14$, or 14%.\n\n(2) We need to perform a chi-squared ($K^2$) test for independence to determine if needing help is related to gender.\nThe data from the table is: $a=40, b=30, c=160, d=270$. Wait, the table seems mislabeled. Let's assume the standard contingency table setup:\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline & Needs Help & Doesn't Need & Total \\\\\n\\hline Male & 40 (a) & 160 (b) & 200 \\\\\n\\hline Female & 30 (c) & 270 (d) & 300 \\\\\n\\hline Total & 70 & 430 & 500 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\nSo, $a=40, b=160, c=30, d=270$.

The minimum value will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, let's find the vertices of the feasible region by finding the intersection points of the boundary lines:\n1. $L_1: 4x-3y-3=0$\n2. $L_2: x-2y-2=0$\n3. $L_3: 2x+6y-9=0$\n\nVertex A (Intersection of $L_1$ and $L_3$):\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}4x-3y=3 \\\\ 2x+6y=9\\end{array}\\right.$. Multiply the first equation by 2: $8x-6y=6$. Add this to the second equation: $(8x-6y)+(2x+6y) = 6+9 \\implies 10x=15 \\implies x=\\frac{3}{2}$.\nSubstitute $x=\\frac{3}{2}$ into $L_1$: $4(\\frac{3}{2})-3y=3 \\implies 6-3y=3 \\implies 3y=3 \\implies y=1$. So, vertex A is $(\\frac{3}{2}, 1)$.\n\nVertex B (Intersection of $L_1$ and $L_2$):\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}4x-3y=3 \\\\ x-2y=2\\end{array}\\right.$. From the second equation, $x=2y+2$. Substitute into the first: $4(2y+2)-3y=3 \\implies 8y+8-3y=3 \\implies 5y=-5 \\implies y=-1$.\nThen $x=2(-1)+2=0$. So, vertex B is $(0, -1)$.\n\nVertex C (Intersection of $L_2$ and $L_3$):\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}x-2y=2 \\\\ 2x+6y=9\\end{array}\\right.$. From the first equation, $x=2y+2$.

So, vertex C is $(3, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the objective function $z=x-5y$ at each vertex:\n- At A$(\\frac{3}{2}, 1)$: $z = \\frac{3}{2} - 5(1) = 1.5 - 5 = -3.5 = -\\frac{7}{2}$.\n- At B$(0, -1)$: $z = 0 - 5(-1) = 5$.\n- At C$(3, \\frac{1}{2})$: $z = 3 - 5(\\frac{1}{2}) = 3 - 2.5 = 0.5 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nComparing the values, the minimum value is $-\\frac{7}{2}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can analyze the slope of the objective function. $z=x-5y \\implies 5y=x-z \\implies y=\\frac{1}{5}x - \\frac{z}{5}$. The slope is $\\frac{1}{5}$. To minimize $z$, we need to maximize the y-intercept $(-\\frac{z}{5})$. We move the line $y=\\frac{1}{5}x$ parallelly upwards. The last point it touches in the feasible region will give the maximum intercept and thus the minimum $z$. By graphing the region, this point is vertex A.\n\nThus, the correct option is D.",
