    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I couldn’t solve for $\\phi$, so I wrote \"cannot be solved.\"\nTeacher：Hello. Let's take a look at your work.\n\nHow did you rewrite the function $y=\\cos (2 x+\\phi)$ after shifting it to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units?\nStudent：After shifting to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units, it becomes $y = \\cos\\left(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi\\right)$.\nTeacher：That is the correct expression for the shifted function. How did you transform one of the functions so you could compare them?\nStudent：I left the functions in their original forms: one as a cosine, the other as a sine, and didn’t try to change either into the other type.\nTeacher：Since you have one cosine function and one sine function, how did you attempt to compare them to solve for $\\phi$?\nStudent：I tried to compare them directly, but since they were in different forms, I couldn’t figure out how to set up an equation to solve for $\\phi$.\nTeacher：You are right, comparing functions of different types is the main challenge. In order for the two function graphs to coincide, their expressions must be equivalent.\n\nWhat needs to be the same about the two functions, `y = cos(2x - π + φ)` and `y = sin(2x + π/3)`, before you can directly compare their arguments?\nStudent：Their forms need to be the same; both should be either all sine functions or all cosine functions.\nTeacher：That's an excellent observation. Which function did you choose to convert, and which trigonometric identity did you use for the conversion?\nStudent：I actually didn’t choose to convert either function, and I didn’t use any trigonometric identities for that.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that for the two functions to be equivalent, they must both be sine or both be cosine. Your error was in not applying a trigonometric identity to perform this necessary conversion.\nStudent：zzc",
