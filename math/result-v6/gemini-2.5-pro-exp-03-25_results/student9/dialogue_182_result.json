    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is C. $(1, +\\infty)$.\nTeacher：Hello. To begin, what did you determine the domain of this function to be?\nStudent：I determined the domain to be $x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0$, so $x < -2$ or $x > 4$.\nTeacher：Excellent. To find the interval where the function is increasing, what did you do after finding the domain?\nStudent：After finding the domain, I differentiated $f(x)$ and solved $f'(x) > 0$ to get $x > 1$.\nTeacher：You found that the function increases when $x>1$. How does this result relate to the domain of the function you found earlier?\nStudent：The interval $x>1$ includes values where $x^2-2x-8$ isn't positive, so some $x>1$ aren't in the domain.\nTeacher：You've established that the function increases when $x > 1$ and that the domain is $x<-2$ or $x>4$. How did you use both of these facts to choose answer C?\nStudent：I directly used $x > 1$ for the increasing interval and didn't check if it fit within the domain.\nTeacher：Your error was in not considering the domain of the function when determining the final interval. You found the condition for increase, $x > 1$, but this condition must also satisfy the domain.\nStudent：zzc",
