    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：Hello. Thank you for sharing your answer. Could you tell me which trigonometric identity you first applied to the expression $\\cos ^{2}\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$?\nStudent：I used the identity $\\sin^2 A = 1 - \\cos^2 A$ for the transformation.\nTeacher：That identity relates sine and cosine of the same angle. The problem contains two different angles, $2\\alpha$ and $\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. How did applying that identity help you connect these two different angles?\nStudent：I thought if I found $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$, I could substitute in the value from $\\sin 2\\alpha$ directly.\nTeacher：To understand your process better, are you implying that the expression $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ is equal to $\\sin 2\\alpha$?\nStudent：Yes, at that moment I assumed they were equivalent and substituted directly.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in assuming that the expression $\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ is equivalent to $\\sin 2\\alpha$. These two expressions do not have the same value.\nStudent：zzc",
