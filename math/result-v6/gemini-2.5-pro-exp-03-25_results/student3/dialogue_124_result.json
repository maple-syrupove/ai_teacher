    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Hello. To check if a function is odd, what property must it satisfy?\nStudent：To check if a function is odd, it must satisfy $h(-x) = -h(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：That is the correct definition. For option D, let's define the function as $h(x) = |f(x) \\bullet g(x)|$.\n\nWhat did you get for the expression $h(-x)$?\nStudent：I got $h(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$.\nTeacher：You have the expression $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$. How can you rewrite $f(-x)$ and $g(-x)$ based on the definitions given in the problem?\nStudent：Since $f(x)$ is odd, $f(-x) = -f(x)$. Since $g(x)$ is even, $g(-x) = g(x)$.\nTeacher：Excellent. Now, please substitute those properties into the expression for $h(-x)$ that you wrote. What does it become?\nStudent：Substituting, it becomes $h(-x) = | -f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：How does the expression $|-f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ relate to the expression $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$?\nStudent：Since taking the absolute value removes the negative sign, $|-f(x)\\cdot g(x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：You have established that $h(-x) = |f(x) \\bullet g(x)|$.\n\nHow does this result for $h(-x)$ compare to the original function, $h(x) = |f(x) \\bullet g(x)|$?\nStudent：They are equal: $h(-x) = h(x)$, so $h(x)$ is an even function.\nTeacher：And what does that imply about your initial choice of option D?\nStudent：It means my choice was incorrect because $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is actually an even function, not an odd function.\nTeacher：You correctly determined that for the function $h(x)$ in option D, the result of your test was $h(-x) = h(x)$. Your error was in concluding this meant the function was odd. A function that satisfies $h(-x) = h(x)$ is, by definition, an even function.\nStudent：zzc",
