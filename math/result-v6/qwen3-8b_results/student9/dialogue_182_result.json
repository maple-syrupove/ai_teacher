    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was C, $(1,+\\infty)$.\nTeacher：What is the domain of the function $f(x) = \\ln(x^2 - 2x - 8)$?\nStudent：The domain is $x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0$.\nTeacher：What are the solutions to the inequality $x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0$?\nStudent：The solutions are $x < -2$ or $x > 4$.\nTeacher：The domain of the function is $(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (4, +\\infty)$. What is the derivative of $f(x)$?\nStudent：The derivative is $f'(x) = \\dfrac{2x-2}{x^2-2x-8}$.\nTeacher：What is the sign of $f'(x)$ on each interval of the domain?\nStudent：For $x < -2$, $f'(x) < 0$; for $x > 4$, $f'(x) > 0$.\nTeacher：The function is monotonically increasing where $f'(x) > 0$. On which interval of the domain is $f'(x) > 0$?\nStudent：On the interval $(4, +\\infty)$, $f'(x) > 0$.\nTeacher：The function is monotonically increasing on $(4, +\\infty)$. Your answer C is incorrect. The correct answer is D.\nStudent：I see, my answer was C, but the correct answer should be D, $(4, +\\infty)$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the interval where $f'(x) > 0$, but you selected the wrong option. The correct answer is D, $(4, +\\infty)$.\nStudent：But when I calculated before, I saw $f'(x) > 0$ when $x > 1$, so I just picked C.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x > 1$, but you must consider the domain of the function when determining where $f'(x) > 0$.\nStudent：zzc",
