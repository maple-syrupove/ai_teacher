    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Let's analyze the properties of $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $. If $ f(x) $ is odd and $ g(x) $ is even, what happens to $ f(-x) \\cdot g(-x) $?\nStudent：Since $f(x)$ is odd, $f(-x) = -f(x)$. Since $g(x)$ is even, $g(-x) = g(x)$. So $f(-x) \\cdot g(-x) = -f(x) \\cdot g(x)$.\nTeacher：Then, what is $ |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| $? How does it compare to $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $?\nStudent：$|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$, so they are equal.\nTeacher：Therefore, $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is an even function, not an odd function. Your conclusion in option D is incorrect.\nStudent：I see. So, $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is actually even, not odd.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is even. Now, let's examine option C: $ f(x) \\cdot |g(x)| $. Is this function odd or even?\nStudent：Let me check: $f(-x) \\cdot |g(-x)| = (-f(x)) \\cdot |g(x)| = -f(x) \\cdot |g(x)|$, so it’s an odd function.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $ f(-x) \\cdot |g(-x)| = -f(x) \\cdot |g(x)| $. Therefore, option C is correct.\nStudent：Okay, I understand now. Option D was incorrect, and option C is actually the correct choice.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that option D is incorrect and that option C is the correct choice. Well done.\nStudent：Thank you. I'll pay more attention to analyzing each option directly using the function definitions next time.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that option D is incorrect and that option C is the correct choice. Well done.\nStudent：Thank you. I'll remember to use the definitions and analyze each option step-by-step in the future.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that option D is incorrect and that option C is the correct choice.

So $f(-x) \\cdot g(-x) = -f(x) \\cdot g(x)$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $ f(-x) \\cdot g(-x) = -f(x) \\cdot g(x) $. What is the relationship between $ |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| $ and $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $?\nStudent：$|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$, so they are equal.\nTeacher：Therefore, $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is an even function, not an odd function. Your conclusion in option D is incorrect.\nStudent：I see, so $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is even, not odd.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is even, not odd. Therefore, your initial choice of option D was incorrect.\nStudent：Yes, I understand now—my initial choice of D was incorrect.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is even, not odd. Therefore, your initial choice of option D was incorrect.\nStudent：Yes, my original answer was D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：You initially chose D, but $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is even, not odd. Therefore, your choice was incorrect.\nStudent：Yes, I chose D, but now I realize $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is actually an even function, not odd.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is even, not odd.
