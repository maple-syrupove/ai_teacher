    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A. $\\frac{3}{10}$.\nTeacher：The total number of ways to pick 3 different numbers from 5 is $ \\binom{5}{3} = 10 $. Are you certain you accounted for all possible combinations?\nStudent：I tried every possible combination of 3 numbers from 1 to 5 to see which ones worked.\nTeacher：You identified 3 combinations as forming a Pythagorean triple, but only one of them is actually a valid Pythagorean triple. Which combination did you identify as valid?\nStudent：I identified (3, 4, 5) as a valid Pythagorean triple.\nTeacher：You correctly identified (3, 4, 5) as a valid Pythagorean triple, but you missed that it is the only such triple in the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
