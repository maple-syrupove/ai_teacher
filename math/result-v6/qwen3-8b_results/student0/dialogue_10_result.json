    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: I couldn't calculate a specific value for $M + m$ because I got stuck differentiating $f(x)$ directly and couldn't finish.\nTeacher：What approach did you take when differentiating $f(x)$?\nStudent：I applied the quotient rule directly to $f(x)$, which resulted in a complicated derivative, and I got lost in the algebra.\nTeacher：What did you do with the derivative after finding it?\nStudent：After attempting to simplify the derivative, I tried to set it equal to zero to find critical points, but the expression was too complex, and I couldn't solve for $x$.\nTeacher：What did you observe about the numerator and denominator of $ f(x) $?\nStudent：I noticed the numerator was $(x+1)^2+\\sin x$ and the denominator was $x^2+1$, but I didn't try to simplify the structure beyond that.\nTeacher：What did you consider when trying to evaluate $ M + m $?\nStudent：I mainly thought about needing the maximum and minimum values from the derivative, but since I couldn't solve for them, I wasn't able to evaluate $M + m$.\nTeacher：What did you do with the symmetry or properties of the function $ f(x) $?\nStudent：I didn't examine any symmetry or specific properties of $f(x)$; I just attempted direct differentiation.\nTeacher：Did you consider substituting specific values of $ x $ to test the behavior of $ f(x) $?\nStudent：No, I did not try substituting specific values for $x$ to analyze the behavior of $f(x)$.\nTeacher：You didn't consider whether the function might have symmetric properties that could simplify finding $M + m$.\nStudent：zzc",
