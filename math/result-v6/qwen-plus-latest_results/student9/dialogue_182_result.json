    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is C. $(1,+\\infty)$.\nTeacher：You selected C, which suggests you believe the function is monotonically increasing for $ x > 1 $. However, consider the domain of $ f(x) = \\ln(x^2 - 2x - 8) $. For the logarithm to be defined, the argument $ x^2 - 2x - 8 $ must be positive. Did you take that into account?\nStudent：No, I only considered the derivative and set $f'(x) > 0$ without analyzing the domain of $f(x)$.\nTeacher：Exactly. The expression $x^2 - 2x - 8 = (x-4)(x+2)$ must be positive for the logarithm to be defined. This occurs when $x < -2$ or $x > 4$. So the domain is $(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (4, \\infty)$. Your derivative analysis must be restricted to these intervals.\nStudent：Understood. So for $x > 1$, not all $x$ are included in the domain, only $x > 4$ from that region.\nTeacher：You're on the right track. Since the domain is $(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (4, \\infty)$, and you found $f'(x) > 0$ for $x > 1$, the derivative condition only applies where the function is defined. So, within the domain, where is $f'(x) > 0$ actually valid?\nStudent：Within the domain, $f'(x) > 0$ is valid only when $x > 4$.\nTeacher：Correct. The function is only defined for $ x < -2 $ or $ x > 4 $, and since $ f'(x) > 0 $ for $ x > 1 $, the intersection of this condition with the domain gives the interval where the function is monotonically increasing. Your mistake was initially ignoring the domain restriction of the logarithmic function.\nStudent：zzc",
