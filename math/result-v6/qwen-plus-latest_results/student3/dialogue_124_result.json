    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Let’s analyze your choice. You claim that $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is an odd function.  \n\nRecall: a function $ h(x) $ is odd if $ h(-x) = -h(x) $.  \n\nNow, compute $ h(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| $.  \nGiven $ f $ is odd, so $ f(-x) = -f(x) $, and $ g $ is even, so $ g(-x) = g(x) $.  \n\nThen:  \n$ h(-x) = |(-f(x)) \\cdot g(x)| = |-f(x)g(x)| = |f(x)g(x)| = h(x) $.  \n\nSo $ h(-x) = h(x) $, meaning $ h(x) $ is even, not odd.  \n\n**Your mistake: You assumed the absolute value of a product involving an odd function remains odd, but absolute value makes the result non-negative and symmetric, which typically results in an even function.**\nStudent：I see, based on my earlier choice, I incorrectly picked D because I thought the absolute value wouldn’t affect the oddness.\nTeacher：You're correct that the absolute value affects symmetry. Your error was assuming that the composition of an odd function with an absolute value preserves oddness, but in fact, $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ becomes even because the absolute value eliminates sign differences, making $h(-x) = h(x)$.\nStudent：Okay, I understand. I didn’t examine each option with the definition; I just went with my intuition on D.\nTeacher：That’s the key issue: relying on intuition without verifying each option using the definitions of odd and even functions. You must check $ h(-x) $ for each case. Your mistake was not testing the symmetry of $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ formally, which would have revealed it's even, not odd.\nStudent：zzc",
