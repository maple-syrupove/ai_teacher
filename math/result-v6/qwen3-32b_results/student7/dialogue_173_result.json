    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was B, $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you arrived at the conclusion that $ A \\cap B = \\varnothing $?\nStudent：I noticed that A is all x such that x < 2, and I thought to look for the overlap with B, but I didn't work out B fully and then just took A ∩ B as x < 2. Since this wasn't in the choices, I picked ∅.\nTeacher：Can you clarify what elements are in set B?\nStudent：Set B is defined by the condition $3 - 2x > 0$.\nTeacher：What is the solution to the inequality $3 - 2x > 0$?\nStudent：The solution is $x < \\frac{3}{2}$.\nTeacher：So, set B is $ \\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2}\\} $. How does this compare with set A?\nStudent：Set A is $\\{x \\mid x < 2\\}$ and set B is $\\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2}\\}$. So, B is a subset of A.\nTeacher：Then, what can you say about the intersection $ A \\cap B $?\nStudent：The intersection $A \\cap B$ should be $\\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2}\\}$.\nTeacher：What led you to initially choose $ A \\cap B = \\varnothing $?\nStudent：I saw that my expression wasn't in the options, so I picked $\\varnothing$ because I thought none matched.\nTeacher：Your mistake was assuming that $ A \\cap B = \\varnothing $ simply because the result you expected wasn’t among the options. You later correctly identified that $ A \\cap B = \\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2}\\} $, which corresponds to option A.\nStudent：zzc",
