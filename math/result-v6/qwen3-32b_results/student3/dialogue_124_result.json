    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Can you explain why you think the absolute value of an odd function would remain odd?\nStudent：I thought that taking the absolute value wouldn't change the function's parity, so if the product was odd, its absolute value would also be odd.\nTeacher：Then, do you believe that the product $ f(x) \\cdot g(x) $ is odd?\nStudent：Since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, I thought their product might be odd.\nTeacher：Can you justify how the product of an odd and an even function behaves in terms of parity?\nStudent：For $f(x)$ odd and $g(x)$ even, $f(-x) = -f(x)$ and $g(-x) = g(x)$. So, $f(-x)g(-x) = -f(x)g(x)$, which means their product is odd.\nTeacher：Then, if the product is odd, what does taking its absolute value do to its parity?\nStudent：Taking the absolute value removes any sign, so $|f(x)g(x)|$ becomes non-negative and loses the odd symmetry. It won't be odd anymore.\nTeacher：So, if you now believe that $|f(x)g(x)|$ is not odd, why did you originally select option D?\nStudent：Because I made the choice based on intuition and didn't carefully analyze each option using the function definition method.\nTeacher：Your reasoning now contradicts your initial choice. What led you to conclude the absolute value would preserve oddness before?\nStudent：I just assumed that since the original product was odd, the absolute value would also be odd, without actually checking by substitution.\nTeacher：That assumption is incorrect. Taking the absolute value of an odd function does not preserve its oddness. This is the error in your initial reasoning.\nStudent：zzc",
