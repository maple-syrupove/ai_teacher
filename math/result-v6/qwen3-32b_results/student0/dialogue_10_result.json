    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by directly differentiating $f(x)$, but the calculations got too messy and I couldn't finish, so I did not obtain a specific value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you approached differentiating $ f(x) $?\nStudent：I computed the derivative using the quotient rule: $f'(x) = \\frac{[(x^2+1)\\cdot(2(x+1)+\\cos x)] - [(x+1)^2+\\sin x]\\cdot 2x}{(x^2+1)^2}$.\nTeacher：Is the derivative correctly simplified and ready for finding critical points?\nStudent：No, I didn't completely simplify the derivative, and it remained quite complicated, making it difficult to proceed to find the critical points.\nTeacher：What method did you consider to find the critical points after obtaining the derivative?\nStudent：I planned to set the numerator of the derivative equal to zero and solve for $x$, but the equation looked too complex, so I got stuck.\nTeacher：What specific part of the numerator made solving for $ x $ particularly challenging?\nStudent：The presence of both polynomial terms and trigonometric terms like $\\cos x$ and $\\sin x$ in the numerator made it hard to isolate $x$.\nTeacher：Teacher：Did you consider any alternative approaches to simplify the function before differentiating?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider transforming or simplifying the function before differentiating; I tried working with the original form directly.\nTeacher：What happens if you add $ f(x) $ and $ f(-x) $?\nStudent：If I add $f(x)$ and $f(-x)$, I get:\n$$\nf(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2+1} + \\frac{((-x)+1)^2 + \\sin(-x)}{(-x)^2+1}\n$$\nSimplifying, $(-x)+1 = 1-x$, and $\\sin(-x) = -\\sin x$:\n$$\n= \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2+1} + \\frac{(1-x)^2 - \\sin x}{x^2+1}\n$$\nCombine numerators:\n$$\n= \\frac{(x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2}{x^2+1}\n$$\nTeacher：What is the simplified result of $(x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2$?\nStudent：$(x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 1) + (1 - 2x + x^2) = 2x^2 + 2$.\nTeacher：Therefore, $ f(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{2x^2 + 2}{x^2 + 1} $. What does this imply about the sum $ M + m $?\nStudent：I didn't realize what this implied at the time, so I wasn't able to determine the value of $M + m$.\nTeacher：What is the expression $ \\frac{2x^2 + 2}{x^2 + 1} $ simplified to?\nStudent：$\\frac{2x^2 + 2}{x^2 + 1} = 2$.\nTeacher：Therefore, $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $. What does this tell you about the relationship between $ M $ and $ m $?\nStudent：If $f(x) + f(-x) = 2$ holds for all $x$, then $M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：Correct. The mistake was in not considering the symmetry of the function, which simplifies the problem significantly.\nStudent：zzc",
