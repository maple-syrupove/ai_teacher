    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was: “$\\phi$ cannot be solved.”\nTeacher：Why do you believe $\\phi$ cannot be solved? What does shifting the graph of a function imply about its equation?\nStudent：I thought that since one function was in terms of cosine and the other in terms of sine, I couldn't directly compare their equations after shifting. Shifting means changing the variable inside the function, but I wasn't sure how to equate them because of the different forms.\nTeacher：Shifting the graph to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units implies replacing $x$ with $x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ in the original function. Did you apply this transformation correctly?\nStudent：I tried applying the shift by replacing $x$ with $x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, getting $y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi)$, but then I got stuck because it was still in cosine form.\nTeacher：You transformed the function correctly, but you didn't use the identity that relates sine and cosine. Did you consider rewriting one in terms of the other?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider rewriting one function in terms of the other using an identity.\nTeacher：You transformed the function correctly but didn't use the identity $\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. Did you recognize this relationship between sine and cosine?\nStudent：No, I didn't recognize that relationship between sine and cosine.\nTeacher：You failed to use the identity $\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ to relate the two functions. Did you attempt to equate the transformed cosine function with the sine function using this identity?\nStudent：No, I did not try to equate the transformed cosine function with the sine function using that identity.\nTeacher：You failed to equate the transformed cosine function with the sine function using the identity. Did you attempt to express both functions in the same trigonometric form?\nStudent：No, I didn't attempt to express both functions in the same trigonometric form.\nTeacher：You failed to express both functions in the same trigonometric form, specifically by converting the sine function into a cosine function using the identity $\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. Did you recognize that this identity allows you to equate the two expressions?\nStudent：No, I didn't realize that this identity would allow me to equate the two expressions.\nTeacher：You failed to use the identity $\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ to rewrite the sine function in terms of cosine, which is necessary for equating the two expressions. Did you try this step?\nStudent：No, I did not try this step.\nTeacher：You failed to rewrite the sine function as a cosine function using the identity, which is essential for comparing the two expressions. Did you understand how to apply this identity?\nStudent：No, I did not understand how to apply this identity in this context.\nTeacher：You failed to rewrite $y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ as a cosine function using the identity $\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. Did you attempt this transformation?\nStudent：No, I did not attempt this transformation.\nTeacher：You failed to rewrite the sine function as a cosine function using the identity, which is essential for solving for $\\phi$.
