    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is C, $(1,+\\infty)$.\nTeacher：What is the domain of the function $f(x)$?\nStudent：The domain is $x^2-2x-8>0$, which gives $x<-2$ or $x>4$.\nTeacher：Your answer is C, $(1,+\\infty)$. But the domain of $f(x)$ is $x < -2$ or $x > 4$. How does this affect the intervals where the function is monotonically increasing?\nStudent：Since the function is only defined for $x < -2$ or $x > 4$, the increasing intervals must also be within the domain.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the domain, but how did you determine that $(1, +\\infty)$ is an increasing interval?\nStudent：I found the derivative $f'(x)$, set it greater than zero, and solved $x>1$ for increasing.\nTeacher：Your derivative calculation led you to $x > 1$, but this must be intersected with the domain of $f(x)$, which excludes $x$ between $-2$ and $4$. What is the intersection of $x > 1$ with the domain?\nStudent：The intersection of $x > 1$ and $x < -2$ or $x > 4$ is $x > 4$, so the correct interval is $(4, +\\infty)$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the intersection as $x > 4$. What was your initial mistake in selecting option C?  \nStudent：zzc\nStudent：Teacher: Good. Now, explain why it is important to consider the domain before analyzing monotonicity.\nTeacher：The domain restricts where the function is defined, so monotonicity can only be analyzed within those intervals. What happens to the derivative’s sign outside the domain?\nStudent：Outside the domain, the function $f(x)$ is not defined, so the derivative’s sign is meaningless there.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the domain and the intersection, but initially selected option C, $(1, +\\infty)$, which is not fully within the domain. Why did you choose this interval before considering the domain?\nStudent：Because I directly solved $f'(x)>0$ and got $x>1$, without checking if those values were in the domain.\nTeacher：You solved $f'(x) > 0$ but overlooked the domain restriction. This led you to select an interval partially outside the function's domain. What does this reveal about your process?\nStudent：It shows that I focused on algebraic manipulation and neglected checking validity within the function's defined domain.\nTeacher：Your process revealed that you solved the inequality algebraically without intersecting the result with the function’s domain. This is the error.\nStudent：zzc",
