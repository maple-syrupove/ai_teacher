    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My incorrect answer is B. $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$.\nTeacher：Let me help you analyze your thinking. Can you first tell me how you determined the set B from the inequality \\(3 - 2x > 0\\)?\nStudent：I looked at \\(3 - 2x > 0\\) and thought of it as another condition on x, but I didn’t actually solve it to find the specific range for B. I just kept it as it was.\nTeacher：Let's focus on set B. Can you show me the steps you would take to solve the inequality \\(3 - 2x > 0\\) for \\(x\\)?\nStudent：Sure. To solve the inequality \\(3 - 2x > 0\\):\n\nFirst, I subtract 3 from both sides to get:\n\\[\n-2x > -3\n\\]\n\nThen, I divide both sides by -2 (and flip the inequality sign):\n\\[\nx < \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, set B is \\(B = \\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2}\\}\\).\nTeacher：Now that we have \\(B = \\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2}\\}\\), can you describe how you determined that \\(A \\cap B = \\varnothing\\)? What was your reasoning for the intersection of sets A and B?\nStudent：At the time, I thought the intersection meant just looking for the parts where x is less than 2, because both sets involved inequalities with x being less than something. I saw \\(A\\) as \\(x < 2\\) and, without fully computing \\(B\\), I just used that. But since my answer \\(\\{x \\mid x < 2\\}\\) wasn't listed, I ended up choosing \\(\\varnothing\\) as the closest option.\nTeacher：Let me understand your reasoning further. You mentioned that you thought the intersection would involve \\(x < 2\\), but since that wasn't an option, you chose \\(\\varnothing\\). \n\nCan you clarify: when you considered \\(A \\cap B\\), did you compare the ranges \\(x < 2\\) (for A) and \\(x < \\frac{3}{2}\\) (for B) to determine their overlap? Or did you assume they had no overlap without comparing them?\nStudent：I didn't compare the ranges directly. I just saw that both sets had conditions with x being less than a value, but I didn't actually look at what their overlap would be. I assumed the intersection would be \\(x < 2\\) and, since that wasn't in the options, I chose \\(\\varnothing\\) without actually comparing \\(x < 2\\) and \\(x < \\frac{3}{2}\\) to see how they intersect.\nTeacher：I see. Your mistake was not comparing the ranges of sets A and B to determine their actual intersection. You assumed the intersection would be \\(x < 2\\) without analyzing how \\(x < 2\\) and \\(x < \\frac{3}{2}\\) overlap. This led you to incorrectly conclude that \\(A \\cap B = \\varnothing\\).\nStudent：zzc",
