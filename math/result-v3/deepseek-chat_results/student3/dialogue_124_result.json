    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Let me ask you this: what is the definition of an odd function? And how does it relate to the absolute value operation?\nStudent：The definition of an odd function is that $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain. The absolute value operation, $|h(x)|$, makes any function non-negative, so it removes the sign—meaning $|h(-x)| = |h(x)|$ regardless of whether $h(x)$ was odd or even.\nTeacher：Let's examine your choice D more carefully. Given that $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, what would $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$ simplify to, based on their properties?\nStudent：Given that $f(x)$ is odd, $f(-x) = -f(x)$. And since $g(x)$ is even, $g(-x) = g(x)$. \n\nSo,\n$$|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |(-f(x)) \\cdot g(x)| = | -f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|.$$ \n\nThis shows $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：I see. Now, based on the definition you provided earlier, what property does the function $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ satisfy in terms of being odd or even?\nStudent：Based on the definition, since $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$, this means $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function, not an odd function.\nTeacher：Your error is that you incorrectly concluded D is correct when in fact $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function, not an odd function.\nStudent：zzc",
