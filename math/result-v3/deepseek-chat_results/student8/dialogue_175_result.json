    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Let me help you analyze your choice. Can you explain how you simplified the expression in option A, $i(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：I saw $i$ and $(1+i)$ in the expression, and since $i$ is an imaginary unit, I thought multiplying it would naturally give a purely imaginary number, so I didn't actually expand or calculate $(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Let's examine your reasoning more carefully. You mentioned that $i$ is an imaginary unit, but did you consider what happens when you square $(1+i)$? What would be the result of $(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：$(1+i)^2 = (1+i)\\times(1+i) = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$.\nTeacher：Let me continue examining your reasoning. You correctly simplified $(1+i)^2$ to $2i$. Now, what happens when you multiply this result by $i$ in option A? What would be the final form of $i(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：If I multiply $i$ by the result $2i$, I get $i \\times 2i = 2i^2 = 2(-1) = -2$. So, the final form is $-2$.\nTeacher：I see the error in your reasoning now. You correctly identified that the result of option A is $-2$, but you didn't recognize that $-2$ is a purely real number, not a purely imaginary number. A purely imaginary number has no real component.\nStudent：zzc",
