    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My incorrect answer was: $k > 0$.\nTeacher：Let me understand your reasoning. What condition did you use to determine that the function \\( f(x) = kx - \\ln x \\) is monotonically increasing on \\( (1, +\\infty) \\)?\nStudent：I used the condition that the derivative $f'(x)$ should be greater than or equal to $0$ for all $x > 1$. So, I set $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0$ for $x > 1$.\nTeacher：Let me probe further. You mentioned \\( f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0 \\) for \\( x > 1 \\). How did you ensure this inequality holds for all \\( x > 1 \\) when you concluded \\( k > 0 \\)?\nStudent：I looked at $k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0$ and thought since $\\frac{1}{x}$ is always positive for $x > 1$, $k$ just needs to be greater than $0$ to keep the expression non-negative. I didn't analyze further how $\\frac{1}{x}$ behaves as $x$ varies in $(1, +\\infty)$.\nTeacher：Let me ask you this: If \\( k = 0.5 \\), does \\( f'(x) = 0.5 - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0 \\) hold for all \\( x > 1 \\)? Consider what happens when \\( x \\) approaches \\( +\\infty \\) and when \\( x \\) approaches \\( 1 \\) from the right.\nStudent：If $k = 0.5$, then $f'(x) = 0.5 - \\frac{1}{x}$. As $x$ approaches $+\\infty$, $\\frac{1}{x}$ approaches $0$, so $f'(x)$ approaches $0.5$, which is positive. But as $x$ approaches $1$ from the right, $\\frac{1}{x}$ approaches $1$, so $f'(x)$ approaches $0.5 - 1 = -0.5$, which is negative. Thus, $f'(x)$ is not always non-negative for all $x > 1$ if $k = 0.5$.\nTeacher：Your error lies in not considering the minimum value of \\( f'(x) \\) on the interval \\( (1, +\\infty) \\). You only ensured \\( f'(x) \\geq 0 \\) for some \\( x > 1 \\), but not for all \\( x > 1 \\).\nStudent：zzc",
