    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was: M ∩ N = { -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 }.\nTeacher：Let me ask you this: What is the definition of the intersection of two sets, M ∩ N?\nStudent：The intersection of two sets, M ∩ N, is the set of all elements that are in both M and N at the same time.\nTeacher：Let me ask you another question: Looking at set M = {x | -3 < x < 1, x ∈ R}, does this set include the endpoints -3 and 1?\nStudent：No, set M does not include the endpoints -3 and 1 because the inequalities are strict (-3 < x < 1), so only numbers strictly between -3 and 1 are included.\nTeacher：Let me ask you one more question: Given that set N includes -3 and 1, and set M excludes -3 and 1, should -3 and 1 be included in the final intersection M ∩ N?\nStudent：No, -3 and 1 should not be included in the final intersection M ∩ N because they are not elements of set M.\nTeacher：I see. Now, let me ask you: Looking at your original answer { -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 }, which elements from this set are actually included in both M and N?\nStudent：From my original answer, the elements that are included in both M and N are -2, -1, and 0. These are strictly between -3 and 1, and they are also in set N.\nTeacher：Your mistake was including -3 and 1 in your original answer for M ∩ N when these elements are not in set M.\nStudent：zzc",
