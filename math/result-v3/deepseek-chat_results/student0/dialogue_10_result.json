    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was: I wasn't able to find a specific value for $M + m$ because my calculation got too complicated, and I stopped before getting an answer.\nTeacher：Let me understand your approach. What method did you initially try to find the maximum and minimum values of the function?\nStudent：I tried to find the maximum and minimum values by directly differentiating the original function $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^{2}+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$ and attempting to solve for the critical points, thinking I could set the derivative to zero and analyze those points.\nTeacher：Let me probe further. When you differentiated the function, what specific difficulty did you encounter in solving $f'(x)=0$ that made you stop your calculation?\nStudent：When I differentiated $f(x)$ directly, the expression for $f'(x)$ became quite complicated due to both the $(x+1)^2$ and the $\\sin x$ in the numerator, as well as the $x^2+1$ in the denominator. After applying the quotient rule, the resulting equation was long and messy. When I tried to set $f'(x)=0$, the terms involving $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$ made it difficult to isolate $x$, so I got bogged down in the algebra and couldn't proceed to find explicit critical points.\nTeacher：Let me ask this: When you encountered the complicated derivative with trigonometric terms, did you consider whether all critical points could be found analytically, or whether numerical methods might be needed?\nStudent：I considered that some critical points might not have analytical solutions and might require numerical methods, but before I could decide on trying that, the derivative felt too unwieldy for me to handle accurately, so I didn't get far enough to actually attempt a numerical method.\nTeacher：Let me ask a more focused question: Did you consider simplifying or rewriting the original function before attempting differentiation, perhaps by expanding or separating terms?\nStudent：No, I didn't think to try simplifying or rewriting the original function before differentiating. I went straight to using the quotient rule on the original form of $f(x)$.\nTeacher：Let me pinpoint your error: You attempted to differentiate the function in its most complicated form without first simplifying the expression, which made the derivative unnecessarily complex and unwieldy to solve.\nStudent：zzc",
