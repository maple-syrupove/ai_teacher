    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：Let me understand your thinking. How did you express \\(\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) in terms of \\(\\sin 2\\alpha\\)?\nStudent：I first used the identity \\(\\cos^2 A = 1 - \\sin^2 A\\), so I wrote \\(\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1 - \\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\). Then I looked at the value given for \\(\\sin 2\\alpha\\).\nTeacher：Let me probe further. How did you connect \\(\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) to the given \\(\\sin 2\\alpha\\)? What trigonometric identity did you use for this step?\nStudent：I didn't actually use a proper identity here. I just assumed \\(\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) could be replaced by \\((\\sin 2\\alpha)^2\\) since both had \\(\\alpha\\) in them, so I set \\(\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2\\).\nTeacher：I see the mistake now. You incorrectly assumed \\(\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) is equal to \\((\\sin 2\\alpha)^2\\) without applying any valid trigonometric identity. These two expressions are not directly equivalent.\nStudent：zzc",
