    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Let’s examine the expression you chose, $i(1+i)^2$. What is the value of $(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：$(1+i)^2 = (1+i)(1+i) = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$\nTeacher：You correctly expanded $(1+i)^2$ to $2i$. Now, what happens when you multiply this result by $i$?\nStudent：When I multiply $2i$ by $i$, I get $2i \\times i = 2i^2 = 2(-1) = -2$.\nTeacher：You have calculated $i(1+i)^2 = -2$, which is a purely real number, not a purely imaginary number. Therefore, your choice of option A is incorrect. Is there any other expression you would like to examine?\nStudent：Let me try option D, $i(1+i)$. $i(1+i) = i \\cdot 1 + i \\cdot i = i + i^2 = i + (-1) = -1 + i$.\nTeacher：You have correctly expanded $i(1+i)$ to $-1 + i$. This result has both a real part ($-1$) and an imaginary part ($i$), meaning it is a complex number, not a purely imaginary number. Therefore, option D is also incorrect. Is there another expression you would like to examine?\nStudent：Let me try option B, $i^2(1-i)$. $i^2 = -1$, so $i^2(1-i) = -1 \\cdot (1-i) = -1 + i$.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified $i^2(1-i)$ to $-1 + i$, which again has both a real part ($-1$) and an imaginary part ($i$), meaning it is a complex number, not a purely imaginary number. Therefore, option B is also incorrect. Let’s now examine option C: $(1+i)^2$. What did you find when you expanded this expression?\nStudent：When I expanded $(1+i)^2$, I got $2i$.\nTeacher：You have correctly expanded $(1+i)^2$ to $2i$, which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. However, let me confirm: did you check whether any of the other options could also result in a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：No, I didn’t check all the options before choosing; I just saw the $i$ and $(1+i)$ and quickly chose option A based on that.\nTeacher：You made a critical error in your initial selection by not thoroughly evaluating all the options before concluding. While you correctly identified that option C results in a purely imaginary number, your mistake was in prematurely choosing option A without verifying whether it actually yielded a purely imaginary number. This oversight led to an incorrect initial choice.\nStudent：zzc",
