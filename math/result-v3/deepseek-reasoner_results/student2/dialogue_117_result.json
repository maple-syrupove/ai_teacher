    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is C, $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：Your error is in the expansion of \\((\\cos \\alpha - \\sin \\alpha)^2\\). You computed it as \\(\\cos^2 \\alpha + \\sin^2 \\alpha\\), omitting the \\(-2 \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\alpha\\) term, which led to an incorrect simplification.\nStudent：I actually didn't expand \\((\\cos \\alpha - \\sin \\alpha)^2\\) in my solution. Could you point out where you think I made this specific mistake?\nTeacher：To identify your error, I need to understand your approach. How did you express \\(\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) in terms of \\(\\sin 2\\alpha\\)? Specifically, which trigonometric identities or steps did you rely on to connect the given \\(\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}\\) to your answer of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)?\nStudent：I first rewrote \\(\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) as \\(1 - \\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\). Then, since I was given \\(\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}\\), I thought I could directly substitute that value for \\(\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\), so I used \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) in place of \\(\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\).\nTeacher：Based on your explanation, your approach involved rewriting \\(\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) as \\(1 - \\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) and then substituting \\(\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) with the given \\(\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}\\). The critical error here is that you treated \\(\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) and \\(\\sin 2\\alpha\\) as equivalent expressions, which they are not. Specifically, \\(\\sin 2\\alpha = 2 \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\alpha\\), while \\(\\sin\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(\\sin \\alpha + \\cos \\alpha)\\), making their squares fundamentally different. This incorrect substitution led to an invalid step in your solution. \n\nWhat specific aspect of this substitution do you recognize as problematic?\nStudent：The problematic aspect is that I assumed \\(\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) could be directly replaced with the given value of \\(\\sin 2\\alpha\\), even though their forms and the angles involved are different, so they're not equivalent. I should have looked for a way to correctly express \\(\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) in terms of \\(\\sin 2\\alpha\\) or relate the angles properly before substituting.\nTeacher：Your error lies in the substitution step: you directly replaced \\(\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) with the value of \\(\\sin 2\\alpha\\) (\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)) without establishing a valid trigonometric relationship between these two distinct expressions. This is invalid because \\(\\sin 2\\alpha\\) and \\(\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) are not equivalent—they involve different angles and functional forms.\nStudent：zzc",
