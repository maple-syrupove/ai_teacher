    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: $\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：To identify the error in your reasoning, let's examine your steps carefully. You mentioned that φ cannot be solved, so we need to pinpoint where the mistake occurred. \n\nFirst, recall that shifting the graph of \\(y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)\\) to the right by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) units means replacing \\(x\\) with \\(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). What expression did you obtain for the new function after this shift? \n\nPlease show your step-by-step calculation for the shifted function.\nStudent：After shifting to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, I replaced $x$ with $x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ in the original function. So I got:\n\n$y = \\cos\\left(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi\\right) = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly derived the shifted function as \\( y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) \\) and set it equal to \\( y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) \\). To solve for \\(\\phi\\), you need to relate these trigonometric expressions. \n\nWhat specific identity or method did you use to equate \\(\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)\\) and \\(\\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\)?\nStudent：I saw that one side was a cosine function and the other side was a sine function, but I didn't think of any specific identity to connect the two. I didn't use any formula to convert cosine to sine or vice versa, so I just thought they couldn't be set equal unless they were already in the same form.\n\nTeacher：Based on your explanation, I've identified the precise error in your reasoning. You correctly derived the shifted function as \\( \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) \\) and recognized that it must equal \\( \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) \\). However, your mistake occurred when you concluded that these expressions \"couldn't be set equal unless they were already in the same form.\"  \n\n**Your error:** You failed to apply the fundamental trigonometric identity \\( \\cos(\\theta) \\equiv \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\) (or equivalent transformations) to reconcile the cosine and sine functions into comparable forms. This omission prevented you from establishing a solvable equation for \\(\\phi\\).  \n\nProceed with your response.\nStudent：zzc",
