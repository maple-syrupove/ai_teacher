    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was: $k>0$.\nTeacher：To begin, let's recall the necessary condition for a function to be monotonically increasing on an interval. What must be true about the derivative \\(f'(x)\\) for \\(f(x)\\) to be monotonically increasing on \\((1, +\\infty)\\)? Please state the condition clearly.\nStudent：For the function to be monotonically increasing on \\((1,+\\infty)\\), its derivative \\(f'(x)\\) must satisfy \\(f'(x) \\geq 0\\) for all \\(x > 1\\).\nTeacher：Based on our discussion, I have identified the error in your reasoning. You correctly stated that \\(f'(x) \\geq 0\\) must hold for all \\(x > 1\\) to ensure \\(f(x)\\) is monotonically increasing on \\((1, +\\infty)\\). However, your initial answer of \\(k > 0\\) is insufficient. The error is that you did not account for the behavior of \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) as \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right. Specifically, \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) approaches 1 in this limit, so \\(k \\geq 1\\) is necessary to satisfy \\(k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0\\) for all \\(x > 1\\). Your condition \\(k > 0\\) allows values like \\(k = 0.5\\), which fails near \\(x = 1\\) (e.g., at \\(x = 1.1\\), \\(f'(x) = 0.5 - \\frac{1}{1.1} \\approx -0.409 < 0\\)).\nStudent：zzc",
