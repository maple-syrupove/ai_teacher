    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is D.\nTeacher：For the function in option D, let \\( n(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| \\). How would you compute \\( n(-x) \\) using the given properties of \\( f \\) and \\( g \\)?\nStudent：To compute \\( n(-x) \\), we substitute \\(-x\\) into the function:  \n\\( n(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| \\).  \nSince \\( f(x) \\) is odd, \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\).  \nSince \\( g(x) \\) is even, \\( g(-x) = g(x) \\).  \nSo, \\( n(-x) = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)| \\).\nTeacher：To determine if \\( n(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| \\) is odd, you computed \\( n(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| \\). This shows \\( n(-x) = n(x) \\).  \n\nRecall the definition of an odd function: \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).  \nDoes \\( n(-x) = -n(x) \\) hold based on your result?\nStudent：Based on my result, \\( n(-x) = n(x) \\), so \\( n(-x) \\) does not equal \\( -n(x) \\) in general. Therefore, the function is not odd.\nTeacher：Based on our dialogue, I have identified your initial error. You selected option D, claiming that \\( |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| \\) is an odd function. However, as you later computed, \\( n(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = n(x) \\), which means \\( n(-x) = n(x) \\). This satisfies the definition of an even function, not an odd one. Therefore, your choice of D was incorrect.\nStudent：zzc",
