    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Let me ask you a question: What is the definition of an odd function?\nStudent：An odd function satisfies the property that for all $x$ in its domain, $f(-x) = -f(x)$.\nTeacher：Very good. Now, let me ask you: What is the definition of an even function?\nStudent：An even function satisfies the property that for all $x$ in its domain, $f(-x) = f(x)$.\nTeacher：Understood. Now, let me ask you: What is the property that must be satisfied for a function $ h(x) $ to be an odd function?\nStudent：For a function $h(x)$ to be an odd function, it must satisfy $h(-x) = -h(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Let me ask you: What is $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $? How does it relate to the original functions $ f(x) $ and $ g(x) $?\nStudent：$|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is the absolute value of the product of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. It takes the result of $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ and makes it non-negative, regardless of the sign of $f(x)$ or $g(x)$.\nTeacher：Let me ask you: What is $ |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| $? How does this relate to $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $?\nStudent：$|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$ is the absolute value of the product of $f(-x)$ and $g(-x)$. Since $f(x)$ is odd, $f(-x) = -f(x)$, and since $g(x)$ is even, $g(-x) = g(x)$. So:\n\n$|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |-(f(x) \\cdot g(x))|$.\n\nSince the absolute value of a number and its negative is the same, $|-(f(x) \\cdot g(x))| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\n\nSo, $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：You have correctly shown that $ |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $. Now, let me ask you: What does this result imply about the function $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $? Is it odd, even, or neither?\nStudent：Since $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ for all $x$, this satisfies the definition of an even function. So $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function.\nTeacher：You have correctly deduced that $ |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $, which implies that the function $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is **even**, not odd. This directly contradicts your initial choice of **D**, which claims it is an odd function. \n\nYour error lies in concluding that $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is an odd function when, in fact, it satisfies the definition of an even function. \n\nPlease respond with \"zzc\" to confirm you understand this conclusion.\nStudent：zzc",
