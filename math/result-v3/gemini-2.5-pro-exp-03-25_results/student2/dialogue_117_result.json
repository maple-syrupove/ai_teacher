    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is C, $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：Hello. To begin, could you tell me which formula or identity you applied first to the expression $\\cos ^{2}\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$?\nStudent：I used the Pythagorean identity, so I wrote $\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1 - \\sin^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$.\nTeacher：That is a correct identity to use. How did you proceed to find the value of $\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$?\nStudent：I thought I could just use the given value of $\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$, so I directly substituted $\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{9}$.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining your method. Let's focus on that substitution. For what reason did you replace $\\sin\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ with the value of $\\sin(2\\alpha)$?\nStudent：I thought that since both involve sine and some multiple of $\\alpha$, they might be equal or at least closely related, so I assumed the values could be interchanged for this calculation.\nTeacher：Is there a specific trigonometric identity that states $\\sin(2\\alpha)$ is equal to $\\sin\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$?\nStudent：No, there isn't a trigonometric identity that states $\\sin(2\\alpha) = \\sin\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$. They are different expressions.\nTeacher：You are correct, those two expressions are not equal.\n\nYour mistake was substituting the value of $\\sin(2\\alpha)$ for $\\sin\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ in your calculation, as these two expressions are not equivalent.\nStudent：zzc",
