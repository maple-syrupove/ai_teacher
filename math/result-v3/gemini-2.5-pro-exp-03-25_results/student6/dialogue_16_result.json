    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My incorrect answer: $\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：Hello. To begin, could you tell me what the new function is after shifting the graph of $y=\\cos(2x+\\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units?\nStudent：After shifting the graph of $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units, the new function is $y = \\cos\\left(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi\\right) = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：Your expression for the new function is correct. Did you try to simplify the expression $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$ before comparing it to the other function?\nStudent：No, I did not try to further simplify $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$ before comparing it to $y = \\sin \\left(2 x+\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$.\nTeacher：Very well. To solve for $\\phi$, the two expressions for the function must be equal. This gives the equation $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) = \\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$. What was it about this specific equation that made you conclude that $\\phi$ cannot be solved?\nStudent：I didn't recognize a way to directly compare $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$ and $\\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$, since they are different types of trigonometric functions (cosine and sine). I wasn't sure how to combine them into the same form, so I thought $\\phi$ could not be solved.\nTeacher：You've correctly identified that the difficulty is comparing a cosine function with a sine function. Let's focus on that specific point. Are you familiar with any trigonometric identities that allow you to rewrite a sine function as a cosine function?\nStudent：Yes, I know that $\\sin\\theta$ can be written as $\\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nTeacher：That's a correct identity. So, what does the right side of the original equation, $\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})$, become when you apply this identity to it?\nStudent：Applying the identity, $\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})$ can be rewritten as $\\cos\\left((2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3}) - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\cos\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)$.\nTeacher：Excellent. You now have the equation $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) = \\cos(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6})$.\nIf we have a general equation of the form $\\cos(A) = \\cos(B)$, what must be the relationship between A and B for this equality to hold true for all values of the variable?\nStudent：For the equality $\\cos(A) = \\cos(B)$ to hold true for all values of the variable, $A$ and $B$ must differ by an integer multiple of $2\\pi$, or $A = B + 2k\\pi$ or $A = -B + 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k$. If we want the functions to coincide for all $x$, the coefficients and constant terms in the expressions must match exactly.\nTeacher：That is the correct general condition for the cosine of two arguments to be equal. When you applied these two conditions, $A=B+2k\\pi$ and $A=-B+2k\\pi$, to the arguments in your equation, what did you find?\nStudent：I didn't go further to actually set $2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ or $2x - \\pi + \\phi = - (2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6})$. Since I hadn't rewritten both sides into the same function at first, I didn't even get to the point of equating their arguments and solving for $\\phi$. That's why I thought $\\phi$ could not be solved.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the two general conditions for when the cosine of two arguments are equal. Let's test one of them. What is the result of applying the condition $A = -B + 2k\\pi$ to the arguments in your equation?\nStudent：Applying the condition $A = -B + 2k\\pi$ to the arguments, we have:\n\n$2x - \\pi + \\phi = -\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) + 2k\\pi$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$2x - \\pi + \\phi = -2x + \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$\n\nCollect like terms:\n\n$2x + 2x + \\phi = \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$\n\n$4x + \\phi = \\frac{7\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$\n\nBut for the functions to coincide for all $x$, the coefficients of $x$ on both sides must be equal, so $4x$ must be $0$, which is not possible for all $x$. Therefore, this condition does not give a valid solution for all $x$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning that this condition is not possible if the two functions are to be identical for all $x$ is sound. You've shown that one of the two general conditions for equality, $A=-B+2k\\pi$, does not work. Does this discovery support your original conclusion that $\\phi$ cannot be solved?\nStudent：No, this discovery alone doesn't fully support my original conclusion. Even though the $A = -B + 2k\\pi$ condition doesn't give a valid solution for all $x$, I should have also tried the $A = B + 2k\\pi$ condition. Only if both routes fail can we decisively claim that $\\phi$ cannot be solved, so I should not have concluded this based on just one case.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the logical flaw in your original approach. Your error was concluding that a solution was impossible before you had tested all the valid mathematical conditions that would make the two functions identical.\nStudent：zzc",
