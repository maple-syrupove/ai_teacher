    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was D, $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Hello. To begin, can you tell me the mathematical definition of an odd function?\nStudent：An odd function satisfies the condition that for all $x$ in its domain, $f(-x) = -f(x)$.\nTeacher：Excellent. And what is the definition of an even function?\nStudent：An even function satisfies $g(-x) = g(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Excellent. Your definitions for both odd and even functions are perfectly correct.\n\nLet's analyze the function in option D. Let's call it $H(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$. What is the first step you would take to test if $H(x)$ is an odd function?\nStudent：The first step I would take is to use the definition of an odd function and calculate $H(-x)$, which means substituting $-x$ into the function: $H(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$.\nTeacher：That's a very clear and logical first step.\n\nNow that you have the expression $H(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$, what does this expression become when you use the properties of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that you mentioned earlier?\nStudent：Using the properties that $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, we have $f(-x) = -f(x)$ and $g(-x) = g(x)$. \n\nSo,\n\\[\nH(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |(-f(x)) \\cdot g(x)| = |-f(x)g(x)| = |f(x)g(x)|\n\\]\n\nSo $H(-x) = H(x)$.\nTeacher：Your calculation correctly shows that for the function in option D, which we've called $H(x)$, the result is $H(-x) = H(x)$. However, you selected option D, which states the function is odd. A function is odd if $H(-x) = -H(x)$. Your calculation demonstrates that the function is even, which contradicts your answer.\nStudent：zzc",
