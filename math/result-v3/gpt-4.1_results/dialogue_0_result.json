    "history_prompt": "\n学生：I wasn't able to obtain a specific value for $M+m$. I tried to directly differentiate $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ and look for its extrema, but the calculations became too complicated, and I couldn't carry them through to the end.\n教师：Since you mentioned that you weren't able to obtain a specific value for $M+m$ and the calculations for finding extrema became too complicated, let me clarify: Is your difficulty limited to algebraic manipulation in solving $f'(x)=0$, or do you think there may have been an error in your approach to differentiating or analyzing the function for its extrema?\n学生：My main difficulty was with the algebraic manipulation when differentiating $f(x)$ and solving $f'(x)=0$. The derivative got very complex, and I wasn't confident in finding or simplifying the solutions for the extrema.\n教师：Thank you for clarifying. Based on your description, your difficulty stemmed from the algebraic complexity involved in differentiating and solving $f'(x) = 0$, not necessarily from a fundamental error in your method. At this point, I see no clear evidence of a mathematical mistake in your approach; rather, the challenge lies in manipulating the expressions. If you have specific derivative steps or equations you computed that you feel unsure about, please share them so I can identify any concrete errors.\n学生：I did not arrive at a concrete value for $M + m$. My approach was to directly differentiate $f(x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ to find its extrema, but I got stuck because the resulting expression for the derivative became quite unwieldy, and I wasn't able to simplify or solve for the critical points.\n教师：From your description, your error is not in your differentiation or initial approach, but rather in not recognizing that the function's maximum and minimum may be more easily determined through analysis of its structure (possibly leveraging symmetry, bounds of $\\sin x$, or alternative reasoning) rather than solely by algebraic manipulation and differentiation. Therefore, your mistake is relying only on direct critical point calculation without considering other potentially simpler strategies for bounding or evaluating $M + m$.\n学生：zzc",
