    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer is A, $i(1+i)^2$.\n教师：To confirm your reasoning, could you explain what it means for a number to be \"purely imaginary\"?\n学生：A purely imaginary number is a complex number that has no real part, meaning it can be written as $bi$ where $b$ is a real number and the real part is zero.\n教师：That's correct. When considering option A, what did you obtain as the result of calculating $i(1+i)^2$? Did the real part of your result become zero?\n学生：I actually didn't expand and calculate $i(1+i)^2$ when I answered; I just saw the $i$ and $(1+i)$, and assumed the result would be purely imaginary. I didn't check if the real part would be zero.\n教师：Thank you for clarifying your process. The error in your solution was assuming the expression $i(1+i)^2$ would be purely imaginary without actually expanding and checking whether the real part is zero.\n学生：zzc",
