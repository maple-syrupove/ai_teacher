How did you determine that all these values were in both \\(M\\) and \\(N\\)?\n学生：I looked at all the elements in set \\(N\\), which are \\(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1\\), and I checked which of them are between \\(-3\\) and \\(1\\), without really considering if the endpoints should be included. So I chose all the ones from \\(-3\\) to \\(1\\) in \\(N\\), but now I realize I didn't carefully check the exact range or intervals.\n教师：Your error is in including the endpoint \\(1\\) from set \\(N\\), which does not lie within the open interval for set \\(M\\). \\(M\\) includes numbers strictly between \\(-3\\) and \\(1\\), excluding both endpoints.\n学生：zzc",
