If so, how many?\n学生：I thought that more than one combination satisfied the condition, but I specifically remember identifying (3, 4, 5) as one. I also thought some other combinations did as well, so I counted more than one.\n教师：The error lies in your belief that more than one combination from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\\) forms a Pythagorean triple. Among these combinations, only (3, 4, 5) is a Pythagorean triple due to the relationship \\(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\\).\n学生：zzc",
