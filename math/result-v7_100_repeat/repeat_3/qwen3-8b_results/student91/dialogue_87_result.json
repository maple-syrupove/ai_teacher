    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried using the distance formula to find the cosine, but I got confused and couldn't get a reasonable answer.\nTeacher：To find the cosine of the angle between vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$, you need to use the dot product formula: $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}}{|\\vec{a}||\\vec{b}|}$. Did you compute $\\vec{b}$ first?\nStudent：No, I didn't compute $\\vec{b}$ first.\nTeacher：You need to determine $\\vec{b}$ first using the given equation $2\\vec{a} + \\vec{b} = (3, 18)$. Did you solve for $\\vec{b}$ correctly?\nStudent：No, I didn't solve for $\\vec{b}$ correctly.\nTeacher：You need to isolate $\\vec{b}$ by subtracting $2\\vec{a}$ from both sides of the equation. Did you perform this step correctly?\nStudent：No, I didn't perform that subtraction step.\nTeacher：You need to subtract $2\\vec{a}$ from both sides of the equation to solve for $\\vec{b}$. Did you correctly compute $2\\vec{a}$?\nStudent：No, I didn't compute $2\\vec{a}$ correctly.\nTeacher：You need to compute $2\\vec{a}$ by multiplying each component of $\\vec{a} = (4, 3)$ by 2, resulting in $2\\vec{a} = (8, 6)$. Did you do this correctly?\nStudent：No, I didn't multiply each component by 2 to get $(8, 6)$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly computed $2\\vec{a}$. The correct value is $2\\vec{a} = (8, 6)$, not what you obtained. Did you use this correct value to solve for $\\vec{b}$?\nStudent：No, I didn't use $(8, 6)$ to solve for $\\vec{b}$.\nTeacher：You need to subtract $2\\vec{a} = (8, 6)$ from $(3, 18)$ to find $\\vec{b}$. Did you perform this vector subtraction correctly?\nStudent：No, I didn't perform that vector subtraction correctly.\nTeacher：You need to subtract the corresponding components of $2\\vec{a} = (8, 6)$ from $(3, 18)$ to find $\\vec{b}$. Did you subtract $8$ from $3$ and $6$ from $18$?\nStudent：No, I didn't subtract $8$ from $3$ and $6$ from $18$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly performed the vector subtraction. The correct value of $\\vec{b}$ is $(3 - 8, 18 - 6) = (-5, 12)$. Did you use this to compute the dot product and magnitudes?\nStudent：No, I didn't use $(-5, 12)$ to compute the dot product and magnitudes.\nTeacher：You did not use the correct vector $\\vec{b} = (-5, 12)$ to compute the dot product $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$ and magnitudes $|\\vec{a}|$ and $|\\vec{b}|$. This is the source of your error.\nStudent：zzc",
