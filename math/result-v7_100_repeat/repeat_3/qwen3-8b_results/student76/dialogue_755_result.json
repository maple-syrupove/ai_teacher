    "question": "20. (12 points) In the Cartesian coordinate system $xOy$, the curve $C: y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}$ intersects the line $l: y=k x+a(a>0)$ at two points M and N.\n\n(I) When $k=0$, find the equations of the tangent lines to C at points M and N respectively.\n\n(II) Does there exist a point P on the y-axis such that for any value of k, we always have $\\angle O P M=\\angle O P N$? (Explain your reasoning)\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution: (I) When $k=0$, the line equation becomes $l: y=a$.\nTo find the intersection points M and N, we solve the system:\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y=a \\\\ y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\end{array}\\right.$\nThis gives $\\frac{x^2}{4} = a$, so $x^2 = 4a$, which means $x = \\pm 2\\sqrt{a}$.\nWithout loss of generality, let $M$ be the point with the positive x-coordinate. So, the coordinates are $M(2 \\sqrt{a}, a)$ and $N(-2 \\sqrt{a}, a)$.\n\nThe derivative of the curve $C: y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}$ is $y' = \\frac{2x}{4} = \\frac{x}{2}$.\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at M is $y'|_{x=2\\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{a}}{2} = \\sqrt{a}$.\nThe equation of the tangent line at M is $y - a = \\sqrt{a}(x - 2\\sqrt{a})$.\n$y - a = \\sqrt{a}x - 2a$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{a}x - y - a = 0$.\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at N is $y'|_{x=-2\\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{-2\\sqrt{a}}{2} = -\\sqrt{a}$.\nThe equation of the tangent line at N is $y - a = -\\sqrt{a}(x - (-2\\sqrt{a}))$.\n$y - a = -\\sqrt{a}x - 2a$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{a}x + y + 3a = 0$. (Note: there is a calculation error in the original Chinese answer for the tangent at N. It should be $y-a = -\\sqrt{a}(x+2\\sqrt{a}) \\implies y-a = -\\sqrt{a}x - 2a \\implies \\sqrt{a}x + y + a = 0$). Let's use the correct one: $\\sqrt{a}x + y + a = 0$.\n\n(II) Yes, such a point exists. The point is $P(0, -a)$.\nLet $P$ be a point $(0, b)$ on the y-axis. Let the intersection points be $M(x_1, y_1)$ and $N(x_2, y_2)$. The condition $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ (where O is the origin) means that the line segment OP (which is on the y-axis) is the angle bisector of $\\angle MPN$. This implies that the angles that PM and PN make with the y-axis are equal. This is equivalent to saying that the slopes of PM and PN are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign (i.e., $k_{PM} = -k_{PN}$, or $k_{PM} + k_{PN} = 0$), assuming M and N are on opposite sides of the y-axis (which they are, as we will see).\n\nLet's find the intersection points by solving the system:\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y=kx+a \\\\ y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\end{array}\\right.$\n$\frac{x^2}{4} = kx+a \\implies x^2 - 4kx - 4a = 0$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum and product of the roots are: $x_1 + x_2 = 4k$ and $x_1x_2 = -4a$.\nSince $a>0$, $x_1x_2$ is negative, meaning one root is positive and one is negative, so M and N are on opposite sides of the y-axis.\n\nThe slopes of PM and PN are $k_{PM} = \\frac{y_1-b}{x_1}$ and $k_{PN} = \\frac{y_2-b}{x_2}$.\nWe require $k_{PM} + k_{PN} = 0$.\n$\\frac{y_1-b}{x_1} + \\frac{y_2-b}{x_2} = 0$\n$\\frac{x_2(y_1-b) + x_1(y_2-b)}{x_1x_2} = 0$\n$x_2y_1 - bx_2 + x_1y_2 - bx_1 = 0$\nSubstitute $y_1 = kx_1+a$ and $y_2 = kx_2+a$:\n$x_2(kx_1+a) - bx_2 + x_1(kx_2+a) - bx_1 = 0$\n$kx_1x_2 + ax_2 - bx_2 + kx_1x_2 + ax_1 - bx_1 = 0$\n$2k(x_1x_2) + (a-b)(x_1+x_2) = 0$\nNow substitute the values from Vieta's formulas:\n$2k(-4a) + (a-b)(4k) = 0$\n$-8ak + 4k(a-b) = 0$\nSince this must hold for any value of $k$, we can divide by $4k$ (assuming $k \neq 0$. If $k=0$, the condition holds trivially as the setup is symmetric).\n$-2a + (a-b) = 0$\n$-a - b = 0$\n$b = -a$\n\nThus, the point P must be $(0, -a)$. This point is independent of $k$. Therefore, such a point exists, and its coordinates are $(0, -a)$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：(II) I let the coordinates of P be (0, b). Then, since P lies on the y-axis, I tried to use the angle bisector property and set up equations for $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ for any k. I started trying to directly use geometry and solve for b but couldn't find a specific value that worked for all k. So I got stuck and couldn't solve for P.\nTeacher：Your approach is on the right track, but you assumed the existence of such a point P without verifying whether the condition $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ can hold for all $k$. You need to analyze whether this condition is geometrically possible for any $k$.\nStudent：But from my calculations, I couldn't find a consistent value for b that worked, so I thought it might not be possible, but I wasn't sure how to verify it completely.\nTeacher：Your reasoning is close, but you failed to consider that the condition $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ for all $k$ implies a specific geometric relationship—namely, that point $P$ must lie on the axis of symmetry of the parabola. This symmetry was not accounted for in your analysis.\nStudent：I don't think P necessarily needs to lie on the axis of symmetry, because I was trying to use the angle bisector property directly.\nTeacher：Your assumption about the angle bisector property is incorrect. The condition $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ for all $k$ does not imply that $P$ must lie on the axis of symmetry—it implies a different geometric constraint, which you have not properly addressed.\nStudent：Could you clarify what the correct geometric constraint is in this scenario?\nTeacher：The correct geometric constraint is that point $P$ must be equidistant from the lines $PM$ and $PN$ for all values of $k$, which implies a specific relationship between $P$ and the curve $C$. You have not properly analyzed this relationship.\nStudent：So, to analyze the relationship, I wrote equations for the distances from P to PM and PN for general points M and N, but I couldn't express this condition neatly in terms of b, which made it hard to proceed further.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in assuming that the condition $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ can be directly translated into equating distances from $P$ to lines $PM$ and $PN$. This approach ignores the geometric nature of the angle equality, which involves direction and not just distance. You need to consider vector relationships or slopes to properly analyze the condition.\nStudent：I tried to set up the equations based on the angle bisector and geometric definitions, but my calculations became very complicated and I couldn’t express b in terms of the other variables, so I got stuck.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in attempting to use distance-based equations for angle equality without considering the directional relationship between lines and vectors. You need to analyze slopes or vector directions to properly enforce $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$.\nStudent：You're right, I didn't consider using slopes or vector directions to analyze the angle condition; I tried to solve it just by setting up geometric equations but got stuck.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in not recognizing that $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ for all $k$ implies that point $P$ must lie on the y-axis and satisfy a specific geometric property related to the parabola's symmetry, which you did not fully explore.\nStudent：I don't think I considered the symmetry property; I was only focused on the angle bisector and the y-axis condition when setting up my equations.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in not recognizing that the condition $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ for all $k$ implies that point $P$ must lie on the y-axis and satisfy a specific geometric property related to the parabola's symmetry, which you did not fully explore.\nStudent：I don't think I thought about the parabola's symmetry property;

I only tried equations with P on the y-axis and the angle bisector, not symmetry.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in not recognizing that the condition $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ for all $k$ implies that point $P$ must lie on the y-axis and satisfy a specific geometric property related to the parabola's symmetry, which you did not fully explore.\nStudent：I don't think I realized that;
