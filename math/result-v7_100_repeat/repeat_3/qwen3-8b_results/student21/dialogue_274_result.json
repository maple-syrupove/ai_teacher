    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is 3.\nTeacher：The distance from a point to a line is calculated using a specific formula. Can you recall the formula for the distance from a point $(x_0, y_0)$ to a line $Ax + By + C = 0$?\nStudent：Yes, the formula is $\\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}$.\nTeacher：The asymptotes of the hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{16} - \\frac{y^2}{9} = 1$ have equations $y = \\pm \\frac{3}{4}x$. Can you write these equations in the form $Ax + By + C = 0$?\nStudent：Yes, they are $4y - 3x = 0$ and $4y + 3x = 0$.\nTeacher：Teacher：Now, using the formula, what value do you get for the distance from the point $(3, 0)$ to one of these lines?\nStudent：For $4y - 3x = 0$, the distance is $\\frac{|4\\times 0 - 3\\times 3|}{\\sqrt{16 + 9}} = \\frac{9}{5}$.\nTeacher：You calculated the distance correctly for one of the asymptotes. However, the question asks for the distance to *one of the asymptotes*, not both. Since both asymptotes are symmetric with respect to the x-axis and the point $(3, 0)$ lies on the x-axis, the distance to either asymptote is the same. Therefore, your answer $\\frac{9}{5}$ is correct.\nStudent：Okay, thank you.\nTeacher：You are welcome. Your answer of $\\frac{9}{5}$ is correct, and you have successfully applied the distance formula to one of the asymptotes. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I understand now!\nTeacher：You're welcome! Your understanding is correct, and your answer of $\\frac{9}{5}$ is accurate. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\nStudent：My answer is 3.\nTeacher：The formula for the distance from a point to a line is correct. However, you did not convert the asymptote equations into the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$ before applying the formula. Let's examine the equations of the asymptotes again.\nStudent：The equations are $4y - 3x = 0$ and $4y + 3x = 0$.\nTeacher：You correctly converted the asymptote equations into standard form. However, you did not apply the distance formula correctly. Let's recheck your calculation for one of the asymptotes.\nStudent：For $4y - 3x = 0$ and point $(3,0)$, the distance is $\\frac{|0-9|}{\\sqrt{16+9}} = \\frac{9}{5}$.\nTeacher：Your calculation is correct. However, the answer $\\frac{9}{5}$ is not among the given choices. Let's double-check the problem statement.\nStudent：I checked again—my answer was 3, but I didn't see it in the options.\nTeacher：The answer $\\frac{9}{5}$ is actually one of the given choices (Option A). Your initial answer of 3 was incorrect. The error lies in your final selection of the answer from the options.\nStudent：I didn't see $\\frac{9}{5}$ in the options at first, so I left it blank.\nTeacher：You initially answered 3, but the correct calculation gives $\\frac{9}{5}$, which is option A. Your error was in not recognizing $\\frac{9}{5}$ as one of the choices.\nStudent：zzc",
