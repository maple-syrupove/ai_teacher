Please explain how you arrived at your conclusion.\nStudent：I tried multiplying out the terms and listed a few that I saw, but I couldn't find an $x^2y^7$ term.\nTeacher：You assumed there is no $x^2 y^7$ term without analyzing the structure of the expansion. Let's consider how the terms are formed. What is the degree of the polynomial $(x-y)(x+y)^8$?\nStudent：The degree of $(x-y)(x+y)^8$ is $1 + 8 = 9$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the degree of the polynomial, but this does not guarantee the presence of the $x^2 y^7$ term. Let's analyze how terms are formed in the expansion. What is the general form of a term in $(x+y)^8$?\nStudent：The general term in the expansion of $(x+y)^8$ is $\\binom{8}{k} x^{k} y^{8-k}$.\nTeacher：You are correct about the general term in $(x+y)^8$, but you have not considered how multiplying by $(x - y)$ affects the exponents. What happens to the exponents when you multiply a term from $(x+y)^8$ by $x$ and by $-y$?\nStudent：When you multiply a term from $(x+y)^8$ by $x$, the exponent of $x$ increases by 1. When you multiply by $-y$, the exponent of $y$ increases by 1 and you introduce a negative sign.\nTeacher：You correctly described the effect of multiplying by $x$ and $-y$, but you have not considered which specific terms from $(x+y)^8$ would produce $x^2 y^7$ when multiplied by $x$ or $-y$. Let's determine which term in $(x+y)^8$ would combine with $x$ or $-y$ to form $x^2 y^7$. What is the exponent of $x$ in the term that, when multiplied by $x$, gives $x^2 y^7$?\nStudent：The exponent of $x$ should be $1$, since $1 + 1 = 2$ for $x^2$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that the exponent of $x$ in the term from $(x+y)^8$ must be $1$ to produce $x^2 y^7$ when multiplied by $x$. Now, what is the corresponding exponent of $y$ in that term?",
