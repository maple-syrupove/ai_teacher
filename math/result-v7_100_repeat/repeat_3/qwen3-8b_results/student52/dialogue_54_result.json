    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$\\tan\\alpha = \\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)$\nTeacher：Your approach incorrectly assumes that $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}$ implies $\\tan \\alpha = \\tan(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4})$. This misapplies the tangent addition formula. What is the correct relationship between $\\tan(\\alpha - \\beta)$ and $\\tan \\alpha$?\nStudent：The correct relationship is $\\tan(\\alpha - \\beta) = \\frac{\\tan \\alpha - \\tan \\beta}{1 + \\tan \\alpha \\tan \\beta}$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the tangent subtraction formula, but you misapplied it. The equation $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}$ does not imply $\\tan \\alpha = \\tan(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4})$. What is the value of $\\tan(\\frac{5\\pi}{4})$?\nStudent：The value of $\\tan\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)$ is $1$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified $\\tan\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1$, but you still misapplied the formula. The equation $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}$ implies a relationship between $\\tan \\alpha$ and $\\tan \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$. What is the correct form of the equation after substituting $\\tan \\frac{5\\pi}{4} = 1$?\nStudent：After substituting, the equation becomes $\\frac{\\tan\\alpha - 1}{1 + \\tan\\alpha \\cdot 1} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly substituted the values into the formula. However, you have not yet solved for $\\tan \\alpha$. What is the next step in solving the equation $\\frac{\\tan\\alpha - 1}{1 + \\tan\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{5}$?\nStudent：The next step is to cross-multiply: $5(\\tan\\alpha - 1) = 1 + \\tan\\alpha$.\nTeacher：You have correctly set up the equation. What is the simplified form of $5(\\tan\\alpha - 1) = 1 + \\tan\\alpha$?\nStudent：The simplified form is $5\\tan\\alpha - 5 = 1 + \\tan\\alpha$.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the equation. What is the next step in solving for $\\tan \\alpha$?\nStudent：The next step is to subtract $\\tan\\alpha$ from both sides: $4\\tan\\alpha - 5 = 1$.\nTeacher：You have correctly subtracted $\\tan \\alpha$ from both sides. What is the value of $\\tan \\alpha$ after solving $4\\tan\\alpha - 5 = 1$?\nStudent：$4\\tan\\alpha = 6$, so $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly solved for $\\tan \\alpha$. However, your initial approach was flawed. The error was in misapplying the tangent addition formula instead of using the subtraction formula. Your final answer is correct.\nStudent：zzc",
