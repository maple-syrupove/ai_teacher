Only provide the information necessary to answer the teacher's current question.\n**If the teacher points out your mistake in a statement and this accusation exactly matches the reason in 【Specific Error JSON】, you must respond with the exact string \"zzc\". If the teacher states an error that does not match your actual mistake, you should deny it and wait for the teacher's next question. If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly. Exception: If asked what your mistake is (e.g., \"What was your error?\"), reply \"I don't know\" and do not reveal the reason.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $4 \\notin M$\nTeacher：If the complement of M in U is {1, 3}, then M must contain all elements of U not in {1, 3}. Therefore, M contains 2, 4, and 5. Your answer C is incorrect because 4 is in M.\nStudent：Oh, I see.\nTeacher：D. $5 \\notin M$ is also incorrect because 5 is in M. The complement of M is {1, 3}, so M must contain 2, 4, and 5. Therefore, 5 is in M, making D false.\nStudent：Understood.\nTeacher：A. $2 \\in M$ is correct because 2 is not in the complement of M, so it must be in M.\nStudent：I got it.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. Your initial answer, C. $4 \\notin M$, was incorrect because the complement of $M$ is $\\{1, 3\\}$, meaning $M$ must contain all elements of $U$ not in the complement, which are $2, 4,$ and $5$. Therefore, $4 \\in M$, making option C false.\nStudent：zzc",
