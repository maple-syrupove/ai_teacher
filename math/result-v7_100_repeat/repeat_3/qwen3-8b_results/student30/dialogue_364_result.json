    "question": "18. (12 points) A supermarket plans to order a certain type of yogurt on a monthly basis. The daily stock is the same. The purchase cost is 4 yuan per bottle, and the selling price is 6 yuan per bottle. Unsold yogurt is sold at a reduced price of 2 yuan per bottle and is completely cleared out on the same day. Based on past sales experience, the daily demand is related to the daily maximum temperature (in ${}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$). If the maximum temperature is not less than 25, the demand is 500 bottles; if the maximum temperature is in the interval [20, 25), the demand is 300 bottles; if the maximum temperature is below 20, the demand is 200 bottles. To determine the order plan for June, the maximum temperature data for each day in June for the past three years were collected, resulting in the following frequency distribution table:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline Max Temperature & {$[10,15)$} & {$[15,20)$} & {$[20,25)$} & {$[25,30)$} & {$[30,35)$} & {$[35,40)$} \\\\\n\\hline Number of Days & 2 & 16 & 36 & 25 & 7 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nUse the frequency of the maximum temperature being in each interval to estimate the probability of it being in that interval.\n\n(1) Find the probability that the daily demand for this yogurt in June is no more than 300 bottles.\n\n(2) Let the daily profit from selling this yogurt in June be Y (in yuan). If the daily stock of this yogurt in June is 450 bottles, write down all possible values of Y and estimate the probability that Y is greater than zero.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\nThe total number of days in the data is the sum of the frequencies: $2+16+36+25+7+4 = 90$ days.\n\n(1) The daily demand is no more than 300 bottles when the maximum temperature is less than 25${}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\nThis corresponds to the temperature intervals $[10,15)$, $[15,20)$, and $[20,25)$.\nNumber of days with temperature less than 25${}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ = (Days in $[10,15)$) + (Days in $[15,20)$) + (Days in $[20,25)$)\n$= 2 + 16 + 36 = 54$ days.\nThe estimated probability is the relative frequency:\n$P(\\text{Demand} \\le 300) = \\frac{\\text{Number of days with temp} < 25}{\\text{Total days}} = \\frac{54}{90} = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6$ or $\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\n(2) The daily stock is fixed at 450 bottles. Profit Y depends on the demand, which in turn depends on the temperature.\nProfit = (Revenue from full-price sales) + (Revenue from reduced-price sales) - (Total cost).\nTotal cost = $450 \\times 4 = 1800$ yuan.\n\nCase 1: Temperature $\\ge 25^{\\circ}C$ (Demand = 500 bottles)\nSince demand (500) > stock (450), all 450 bottles are sold at the full price of 6 yuan.\nRevenue = $450 \\times 6 = 2700$.\nProfit Y = $2700 - 1800 = 900$ yuan.\n\nCase 2: Temperature $\\in [20, 25)^{\\circ}C$ (Demand = 300 bottles)\nSince demand (300) < stock (450), 300 bottles are sold at 6 yuan, and the remaining $450-300=150$ bottles are sold at 2 yuan.\nRevenue = $(300 \\times 6) + (150 \\times 2) = 1800 + 300 = 2100$.\nProfit Y = $2100 - 1800 = 300$ yuan.\n\nCase 3: Temperature $< 20^{\\circ}C$ (Demand = 200 bottles)\nSince demand (200) < stock (450), 200 bottles are sold at 6 yuan, and the remaining $450-200=250$ bottles are sold at 2 yuan.\nRevenue = $(200 \\times 6) + (250 \\times 2) = 1200 + 500 = 1700$.\nProfit Y = $1700 - 1800 = -100$ yuan.\n\nSo, the possible values of Y are $\\{900, 300, -100\\}$.\n\nY is greater than zero when the profit is 900 or 300. This occurs when the temperature is $\\ge 20^{\\circ}C$.\nWe need to find the number of days with temperature $\\ge 20^{\\circ}C$. From the table, this is:\n(Days in $[20,25)$) + (Days in $[25,30)$) + (Days in $[30,35)$) + (Days in $[35,40)$)\n$= 36 + 25 + 7 + 4 = 72$ days.\n\nThe estimated probability that Y is greater than zero is:\n$P(Y > 0) = \\frac{\\text{Number of days with temp} \\ge 20}{\\text{Total days}} = \\frac{72}{90} = \\frac{8}{10} = 0.8$ or $\\frac{4}{5}$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer: The probability that demand does not exceed 300 bottles is (2+16+36)/6/90 = 54/540 = 0.1.\nTeacher：Your calculation incorrectly uses the total number of days (90) as the denominator. The correct denominator should be the total number of days in the frequency distribution table, which is 2 + 16 + 36 + 25 + 7 + 4 = 90. However, you should only consider the intervals where demand is no more than 300 bottles, which are [10,15), [15,20), and [20,25). Thus, the probability should be (2 + 16 + 36)/90.\nStudent：Oh, so the probability should be (2+16+36)/90 = 54/90.\nTeacher：Your calculation is now correct. The probability that the daily demand is no more than 300 bottles is $ \\frac{54}{90} = 0.6 $.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I understand now.\nTeacher：For part (2), you have not considered the different scenarios of demand relative to the stock of 450 bottles. You need to calculate profit for each temperature interval and determine when Y > 0.\nStudent：Okay, I’ll consider all three demand scenarios based on the stock of 450 bottles:\n\n- If demand = 200, all 200 sold normally, 250 at a discount.\n- If demand = 300, 300 sold normally, 150 at a discount.\n- If demand = 500, only 450 sold at the normal price, 0 at a discount. \n\nIs this correct?\nTeacher：Your analysis is incorrect. You have not considered that the demand in each temperature interval is fixed, not variable. You must calculate profit based on the fixed demand for each temperature interval, not assume different demand values.\nStudent：So, for each interval, if demand is 200, profit is (200 × 2)+(250 × –2). If demand is 300, profit is (300 × 2)+(150 × –2). If demand is 500, profit is (450 × 2)+(50 × 0).\nTeacher：Your calculation for the profit when demand is 500 is incorrect. You have not accounted for the fact that unsold yogurt is sold at a reduced price of 2 yuan, not 0. The correct profit in this case should be (450 × 2) + (50 × 2).\nStudent：Oh, I see! So, when demand is 500, profit is (450 × 2) + (0 × 2), since all 450 stocked bottles match the demand and there's no unsold inventory. Right?\nTeacher：Your calculation for the profit when demand is 500 is still incorrect. You have not properly accounted for the fact that all 450 bottles are sold at the normal price, and there is no unsold inventory. The correct profit in this case should be (450 × 2) + (0 × 2).\nStudent：So for demand 500, profit is (450 × 2) + (0 × 2) = 900 yuan.\nTeacher：Your calculation for the profit when demand is 500 is still incorrect. You have not properly accounted for the fact that all 450 bottles are sold at the normal price, and there is no unsold inventory. The correct profit in this case should be (450 × 2) + (0 × 2).\nStudent：Okay, so when demand is 500, profit is 450 × 2 = 900 yuan.\nTeacher：Your calculation for the profit when demand is 500 is still incorrect. You have not properly accounted for the fact that all 450 bottles are sold at the normal price, and there is no unsold inventory. The correct profit in this case should be (450 × 2) + (0 × 2).\nStudent：But isn't it just 450 × 2 = 900 if all 450 are sold at normal price and none left over?\nTeacher：Your calculation is correct. The profit when demand is 500 is indeed $450 \\times 2 = 900$ yuan.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I will use these profit values to estimate the probability that Y > 0.\nTeacher：Your calculation for the profit when demand is 500 is correct. Now, you need to calculate the profit for each temperature interval and determine the probability that Y > 0.\nStudent：Okay, I will calculate the profit for each interval and then find the probability that Y > 0.\nTeacher：Your calculation for the profit when demand is 300 is incorrect. You have not properly accounted for the fact that only 300 bottles are sold at the normal price, and the remaining 150 are sold at a reduced price. The correct profit in this case should be $ (300 \\times 2) + (150 \\times 2) $.\nStudent：So for demand 300, profit is (300 × 2) + (150 × 2) = 600 + 300 = 900 yuan.\nTeacher：Your calculation for the profit when demand is 300 is incorrect. You have not properly accounted for the fact that only 300 bottles are sold at the normal price, and the remaining 150 are sold at a reduced price of 2 yuan. The correct profit in this case should be $ (300 \\times 6) + (150 \\times 2) $.\nStudent：So for demand 300, profit is (300 × 6) + (150 × 2) = 1800 + 300 = 2100 yuan.\nTeacher：Your calculation for the profit when demand is 300 is still incorrect. You have not properly accounted for the selling prices: normal price is 6 yuan, and reduced price is 2 yuan. The correct profit in this case should be $ (300 \\times 6) + (150 \\times 2) $.\nStudent：So for demand 300, profit is (300 × 6) + (150 × 2) = 1800 + 300 = 2100 yuan.\nTeacher：Your calculation for the profit when demand is 300 is correct. Now, you need to calculate the profit for each temperature interval and determine the probability that Y > 0.\nStudent：Okay, I’ll do the same for demand 200: (200 × 6) + (250 × 2) = 1200 + 500 = 1700 yuan.\nTeacher：Your calculation for the profit when demand is 200 is incorrect. You have not properly accounted for the fact that only 200 bottles are sold at the normal price, and the remaining 250 are sold at a reduced price of 2 yuan. The correct profit in this case should be $ (200 \\times 6) + (250 \\times 2) $.\nStudent：So for demand 200, profit is (200 × 6) + (250 × 2) = 1200 + 500 = 1700 yuan.\nTeacher：Your calculation for the profit when demand is 200 is correct. Now, you need to calculate the probability that Y > 0 by considering the frequency of each temperature interval and the corresponding profit values.\nStudent：Okay, I will check the number of days for each demand case and the corresponding profit, then find the total probability for Y > 0.\nTeacher：Your calculation for the profit when demand is 200 is correct. Now, you need to determine the probability that Y > 0 by considering the frequency of each temperature interval and the corresponding profit values.\nStudent：Okay. For demand 200: 18 days (2 + 16), for demand 300: 36 days, for demand 500: 36 days (25 + 7 + 4). So the probability that Y > 0 is (18 + 36 + 36)/90 = 90/90 = 1.\nTeacher：Your calculation for the number of days corresponding to demand 500 is incorrect. The interval with a demand of 500 bottles is [25, 30), which corresponds to 25 days, not 36.\nStudent：Oh, I see. So for demand 500, only [25, 30) applies, which is 25 days.\nTeacher：Your calculation for the number of days corresponding to demand 500 is correct. Now, you need to verify if all profit values are positive and sum the probabilities accordingly.\nStudent：Yes, for profit: demand 200 (18 days), demand 300 (36 days), demand 500 (25 days). All profits are positive. Probability Y > 0 is (18+36+25)/90 = 79/90.\nTeacher：Your calculation for the probability that Y > 0 is correct. The probability that Y is greater than zero is $ \\frac{79}{90} $.",
