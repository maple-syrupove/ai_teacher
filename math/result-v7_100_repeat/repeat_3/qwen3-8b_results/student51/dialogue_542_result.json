    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I first expanded (1 + a x) to get 1 + a x, then expanded (1 + x)^5; I took the x^2 term directly. My answer is a = 0.\nTeacher：When you expand $(1 + ax)(1 + x)^5$, you must consider all contributions to the $x^2$ term, not just the direct multiplication of the $x^2$ term from $(1 + x)^5$ with the constant term from $(1 + ax)$. What did you overlook in your calculation?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You forgot to consider the contribution of the $x$ term from $(1 + ax)$ multiplied by the $x$ term from $(1 + x)^5$. What is the coefficient of $x$ in $(1 + x)^5$?\nStudent：The coefficient of $x$ in $(1 + x)^5$ is 5.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the coefficient of $x$ in $(1 + x)^5$, but you did not multiply it by $a$ when calculating the total coefficient of $x^2$. What is the contribution of the $x$ term from $(1 + ax)$ and the $x$ term from $(1 + x)^5$ to the $x^2$ term?\nStudent：The contribution is $a \\times 5 = 5a$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the contribution of $5a$ from the $x$ term in $(1 + ax)$ and the $x$ term in $(1 + x)^5$. However, you also need to account for the contribution of the constant term from $(1 + ax)$ multiplied by the $x^2$ term from $(1 + x)^5$. What is the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(1 + x)^5$?\nStudent：The coefficient of $x^2$ in $(1 + x)^5$ is 10.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(1 + x)^5$ as 10. Now, what is the total coefficient of $x^2$ in the expansion of $(1 + ax)(1 + x)^5$?\nStudent：The total coefficient of $x^2$ is $10 + 5a$.\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated the total coefficient of $x^2$ as $10 + 5a$. However, you did not set this equal to the given value of 5 and solve for $a$. What is the equation you should solve to find $a$?\nStudent：The equation is $10 + 5a = 5$.\nTeacher：You have correctly formed the equation $10 + 5a = 5$, but you solved it incorrectly. What is the value of $a$ that satisfies this equation?\nStudent：The value of $a$ that satisfies $10 + 5a = 5$ is $a = -1$.\nTeacher：You have correctly solved the equation and found $a = -1$. However, this answer is not among the provided choices. What did you do wrong in your calculation?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You incorrectly solved the equation $10 + 5a = 5$. What is the correct value of $a$ that satisfies this equation?\nStudent：$a = -1$\nTeacher：You correctly solved the equation $10 + 5a = 5$, but your answer $a = -1$ is not among the choices.

What is the correct total coefficient of $x^2$ in the expansion?\nStudent：The correct total coefficient of $x^2$ should be $10 + 5a$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the total coefficient of $x^2$ as $10 + 5a$, but you did not account for the contribution of the constant term from $(1 + ax)$ multiplied by the $x^2$ term from $(1 + x)^5$. What is the contribution of the constant term from $(1 + ax)$ to the $x^2$ term?\nStudent：The contribution is $1 \\times 10 = 10$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the contribution of the constant term from $(1 + ax)$ as $1 \\times 10 = 10$. However, you did not account for the contribution of the $ax$ term multiplied by the $x$ term from $(1 + x)^5$. What is the coefficient of $x$ in $(1 + x)^5$?\nStudent：The coefficient of $x$ in $(1 + x)^5$ is $5$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the coefficient of $x$ in $(1 + x)^5$ as 5, but you did not multiply it by $a$ when calculating the total coefficient of $x^2$.
