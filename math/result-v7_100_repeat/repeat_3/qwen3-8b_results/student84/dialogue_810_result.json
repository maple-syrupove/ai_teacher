    "question": "18. A student interest group randomly investigated the daily air quality level and the number of people exercising in a certain park for 100 days in a certain city. The data is organized into the table below (unit: days):\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}\n\\hline $\\begin{array}{l}\\text{Number of People} \\\\\n\\text{Air Quality Level}\\end{array}$ & {$[0,200]$} & $(200,400]$ & $(400,600]$ \\\\\n\\hline 1 (Excellent) & 2 & 16 & 25 \\\\\n\\hline 2 (Good) & 5 & 10 & 12 \\\\\n\\hline 3 (Light Pollution) & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline 4 (Moderate Pollution) & 7 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(1) Estimate the respective probabilities that the city's daily air quality level is 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n(2) Find the estimated average number of people exercising in the park per day (use the midpoint of each group interval as the representative value).\n\n(3) If the air quality level on a certain day is 1 or 2, it is called a \"good air quality\" day. If the level is 3 or 4, it is called a \"poor air quality\" day. Based on the given data, complete the following $2 \\times 2$ contingency table, and based on the table, determine if there is 95% confidence to believe that the number of people exercising in the park is related to the city's air quality on that day.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\n\\hline & People $\\leq 400$ & People $>400$ \\\\\n\\hline Good Air Quality & & \\\\\n\\hline Poor Air Quality & & \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nAppendix: $\\quad K^{2}=\\frac{n(a d-b c)^{2}}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)}$,\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}\n\\hline$P\\left(K^{2} \\geq k\\right)$ & 0.050 & 0.010 & 0.001 \\\\\n\\hline$k$ & 3.841 & 6.635 & 10.828 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n",
    "correct_answer": "【Solution】\n(1) The total number of days surveyed is 100.\nNumber of days with level 1 quality = $2+16+25 = 43$. Probability P(Level 1) = $\\frac{43}{100} = 0.43$.\nNumber of days with level 2 quality = $5+10+12 = 27$. Probability P(Level 2) = $\\frac{27}{100} = 0.27$.\nNumber of days with level 3 quality = $6+7+8 = 21$. Probability P(Level 3) = $\\frac{21}{100} = 0.21$.\nNumber of days with level 4 quality = $7+2+0 = 9$. Probability P(Level 4) = $\\frac{9}{100} = 0.09$.\n\n(2) We use the midpoints of the intervals for the number of people: 100 for $[0,200]$, 300 for $(200,400]$, and 500 for $(400,600]$.\nThe total number of people for each interval is:\n- $[0,200]$: $2+5+6+7 = 20$ days.- $(200,400]$: $16+10+7+2 = 35$ days.- $(400,600]$: $25+12+8+0 = 45$ days.The estimated average number of people is:\n$\\bar{x} = \\frac{100 \\times 20 + 300 \\times 35 + 500 \\times 45}{100} = \\frac{2000 + 10500 + 22500}{100} = \\frac{35000}{100} = 350$ people.\n\n(3) We need to fill the $2 \\times 2$ contingency table.\n\"Good Air Quality\" corresponds to levels 1 and 2.\n\"Poor Air Quality\" corresponds to levels 3 and 4.\n\"People $\\leq 400$\" corresponds to the first two columns of the number of people.\n\"People $> 400$\" corresponds to the last column.\n\n- Good Air Quality & People $\\leq 400$: $(2+16) + (5+10) = 18 + 15 = 33$.\n- Good Air Quality & People $> 400$: $25 + 12 = 37$.\n- Poor Air Quality & People $\\leq 400$: $(6+7) + (7+2) = 13 + 9 = 22$.\n- Poor Air Quality & People $> 400$: $8 + 0 = 8$.\n\nThe completed $2 \\times 2$ table is:\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}\n\\hline & People $\\leq 400$ & People $>400$ & Total \\\\\n\\hline Good Air Quality & 33 & 37 & 70 \\\\\n\\hline Poor Air Quality & 22 & 8 & 30 \\\\\n\\hline Total & 55 & 45 & 100 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nNow we calculate the $K^2$ statistic: $a=33, b=37, c=22, d=8, n=100$.\n$K^2 = \\frac{n(ad-bc)^2}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)} = \\frac{100(33 \\times 8 - 37 \\times 22)^2}{(70)(30)(55)(45)}$\n$K^2 = \\frac{100(264 - 814)^2}{5197500} = \\frac{100(-550)^2}{5197500} = \\frac{100(302500)}{5197500} = \\frac{30250000}{5197500} \\approx 5.820$.\n\nFor 95% confidence, the significance level is $\\alpha=0.05$. From the appendix, the critical value is $k=3.841$.\nSince our calculated value $K^2 \\approx 5.820 > 3.841$, we reject the null hypothesis of independence.\nTherefore, there is 95% confidence to believe that the number of people exercising in the park is related to the city's air quality on that day.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Good Air Quality: 33 (sum of all for levels 1 and 2, people ≤400), 37 (sum for levels 1 and 2, people >400)\nPoor Air Quality: 22 (sum of all for levels 3 and 4, people ≤400), 8 (sum for levels 3 and 4, people >400)\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated the totals for each category, but you have misclassified the number of people exercising in the park. The \"People ≤ 400\" column should include all days where the number of people is in the intervals [0,200] and (200,400], while \"People > 400\" should include those in (400,600]. You have incorrectly assigned values to these categories.\nStudent：I thought “People ≤ 400” should be the total of the [0,200] and (200,400] intervals added together for each air quality group, and “People > 400” should be the (400,600] interval for each group. So for “Good Air Quality” ([levels 1 and 2]), I summed all values in those intervals together for both categories.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the grouping for \"People ≤ 400\" and \"People > 400,\" but you have misapplied the totals. The contingency table requires the counts of days, not the number of people, based on air quality and exercise levels. You have summed the number of people instead of the number of days.\nStudent：No, I summed the number of days for each air quality group and people interval, not the number of people.\nTeacher：You have misunderstood the contingency table's structure. It requires the count of days, not the number of people, for each combination of air quality and exercise level. You have summed the number of people instead of the number of days.\nStudent：No, I did add up the days within each cell—I used the table's cell entries, which are all in days.\nTeacher：You have correctly summed the days for each cell, but you have misassigned the values to the contingency table. The \"People ≤ 400\" column should include all days where the number of people is in [0,200] or (200,400], while \"People > 400\" should include those in (400,600]. You have incorrectly assigned the totals across the rows.\nStudent：zzc",
