    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by directly differentiating $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^{2}+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$ and setting the derivative equal to zero to solve for $x$.\nTeacher：What did you obtain for the derivative $ f'(x) $?\nStudent：I got $f'(x)=\\frac{2(x+1)(x^2+1) - ((x+1)^2+\\sin x)\\cdot 2x + \\cos x (x^2+1)}{(x^2+1)^2}$.\nTeacher：Your derivative is incorrect. Let me ask: Did you apply the quotient rule correctly, and did you account for the derivative of the numerator properly?\nStudent：I thought I applied the quotient rule, but I may have made mistakes in differentiating the numerator, especially with the $\\sin x$ part.\nTeacher：You forgot to differentiate the entire numerator, which includes both $(x+1)^2$ and $\\sin x$. Did you compute the derivative of the numerator correctly?\nStudent：I took the derivative of $(x+1)^2$ as $2(x+1)$ and of $\\sin x$ as $\\cos x$, then added them together.\nTeacher：You correctly differentiated the numerator, but you forgot to multiply the derivative of the numerator by the denominator when applying the quotient rule. Did you account for the chain rule in the entire differentiation process?\nStudent：I think I used the standard quotient rule format, but I might have missed some parts involving the chain rule across the full expression.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the quotient rule by not properly multiplying the derivative of the numerator by the denominator. Let me ask: Did you use the correct formula for the quotient rule, $ \\left( \\frac{u}{v} \\right)' = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} $?\nStudent：Yes, I tried to use that formula: $\\frac{u'}{v} - \\frac{u v'}{v^2}$.\nTeacher：You misapplied the quotient rule by incorrectly distributing the terms. The correct derivative should involve subtracting $ u v' $, not adding it. Let me ask: Did you correctly compute $ u'v - uv' $?\nStudent：I guess I made an error with the subtraction and ended up getting the wrong expression, likely adding instead.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the quotient rule by adding $ u v' $ instead of subtracting it. This led to an incorrect derivative.\nStudent：I see. I made an error in the sign while computing the derivative, which caused the result to be incorrect.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the quotient rule by adding $ u v' $ instead of subtracting it, leading to an incorrect derivative.\nStudent：Sorry, I don't think that's the source of my main error.\nTeacher：You still have not addressed the core issue: you forgot to differentiate the entire numerator, which includes both $(x+1)^2$ and $\\sin x$. Did you compute the derivative of the numerator correctly?\nStudent：Yes, I computed the derivative of the numerator as $2(x+1) + \\cos x$.\nTeacher：You correctly differentiated the numerator, but you forgot to multiply the derivative of the numerator by the denominator when applying the quotient rule. This led to an incorrect derivative.\nStudent：Sorry, that's not the main source of my mistake.\nTeacher：You still have not addressed the core issue: you forgot to differentiate the entire numerator, which includes both $(x+1)^2$ and $\\sin x$. Did you compute the derivative of the numerator correctly?\nStudent：Yes, I added the derivatives of $(x+1)^2$ and $\\sin x$ to get $2(x+1)+\\cos x$ as the numerator's derivative.\nTeacher：You correctly differentiated the numerator, but you forgot to multiply the derivative of the numerator by the denominator when applying the quotient rule.

Did you compute the derivative of the numerator correctly?\nStudent：Yes, I differentiated both $(x+1)^2$ and $\\sin x$, so the derivative of the numerator is $2(x+1) + \\cos x$.\nTeacher：You correctly differentiated the numerator, but you forgot to multiply the derivative of the numerator by the denominator when applying the quotient rule.
