    "question": "17. (12 points) Given that $\\{a_{n}\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3. The sequence $\\{b_{n}\\}$ satisfies $b_{1}=1, b_{2}=\\frac{1}{3}$, and $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$.\n\n(I) Find the general term formula for $\\{a_{n}\\}$.\n\n(II) Find the sum of the first $n$ terms of $\\{b_{n}\\}$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\n(I) We are given the recurrence relation $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$, which can be factored as $(a_n+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\nLet's use the given values for $n=1$ to find $a_1$.\nFor $n=1$: $(a_1+1)b_2 = 1 \\cdot b_1$.\nWe are given $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n$(a_1+1)(\\frac{1}{3}) = 1$.\n$a_1+1 = 3$.\n$a_1 = 2$.\n\nWe are told that $\\{a_n\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $d=3$. \nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$a_n = 2 + (n-1)3 = 2 + 3n - 3 = 3n - 1$.\n\n(II) Now we need to find the sum of the first n terms of $\\{b_n\\}$. First, let's find a general formula for $\\{b_n\\}$.\nFrom part (I), we know $a_n = 3n-1$. Substitute this into the recurrence relation $(a_n+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\n$((3n-1)+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\n$(3n)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\nFor $n \\ge 1$, we can divide by $n$:\n$3b_{n+1} = b_n$.\nThis can be rewritten as $\\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThis shows that $\\{b_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with a common ratio $q = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nWe are given the first term $b_1 = 1$.\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula $S_n = \\frac{b_1(1-q^n)}{1-q}$.\n$S_n = \\frac{1(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n)}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{3}{2}(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n) = \\frac{3}{2}(1 - 3^{-n})$.\nThis can also be written as $\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot 3^n} = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^{n-1}}$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：(I) $a_n = 2 + 3(n-1)$\n\n(II) I couldn't find a general term for $b_n$, so I wasn't able to find the sum of the first $n$ terms.\nTeacher：For part (I), your formula for $ a_n $ is correct. For part (II), you have not properly utilized the recurrence relation provided to derive a general term for $ b_n $, which is necessary to compute the sum.\nStudent：Okay. For part (II), I just used the given values $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$, and couldn't deduce a general term from the recurrence relation.\nTeacher：You have not analyzed the recurrence relation $ a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = n b_n $ thoroughly. You need to manipulate it algebraically to express $ b_{n+1} $ in terms of $ b_n $, which will help you find a pattern or closed-form expression for $ b_n $.\nStudent：So, should I try to solve for $b_{n+1}$ in terms of $b_n$ directly from the recurrence?\nTeacher：Yes, that is the correct approach. Let's proceed with solving for $ b_{n+1} $ in terms of $ b_n $.\nStudent：If I solve for $b_{n+1}$, I get:\n$a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = n b_n$\n$\\Rightarrow (a_n + 1) b_{n+1} = n b_n$\n$\\Rightarrow b_{n+1} = \\dfrac{n b_n}{a_n + 1}$\nTeacher：That is correct. Now, substitute the expression for $ a_n $ from part (I) into this formula to express $ b_{n+1} $ in terms of $ b_n $. This will allow you to identify a pattern or derive a general term for $ b_n $.\nStudent：$a_n = 2 + 3(n-1)$, so $a_n + 1 = 3n$.  \nThus, $b_{n+1} = \\frac{n b_n}{3n} = \\frac{b_n}{3}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly substituted $ a_n + 1 = 3n $, but you have made an error in simplifying $ \\frac{n b_n}{3n} $. The correct simplification is $ \\frac{b_n}{3} $, which you did. However, this suggests a constant ratio between consecutive terms of $ \\{b_n\\} $, implying a geometric sequence. You have not verified this pattern with the given initial terms or derived the general term accordingly.\nStudent：Oh, I see. But when I checked $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$, they fit $b_2 = \\frac{b_1}{3}$. I just couldn't see how to continue to a general formula, so I stopped there.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $ \\{b_n\\} $ is a geometric sequence with common ratio $ \\frac{1}{3} $. However, you have not explicitly stated the general term formula for $ b_n $, which is necessary to compute the sum.\nStudent：So in that case, should I just use $b_n = 1 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{3})^{n-1}$ for the general term?\nTeacher：Yes, that is correct. However, you have not verified this formula with the recurrence relation or confirmed its validity for all $ n $. You must ensure that the general term satisfies both the initial conditions and the recurrence relation.\nStudent：I checked $b_1 = 1$ and $b_2 = \\frac{1}{3}$, which fit $b_n = (\\frac{1}{3})^{n-1}$, so it seems to work.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the general term for $ b_n $, but you have not verified that it satisfies the recurrence relation for all $ n $. This is essential to confirm the validity of your solution.\nStudent：Let me check: For $b_{n+1} = (\\frac{1}{3})^n,$ and $b_n = (\\frac{1}{3})^{n-1}$, so $\\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} = \\frac{1}{3}$. It fits the pattern.\nTeacher：You have verified the ratio between consecutive terms, but you have not explicitly substituted the general term into the original recurrence relation to confirm its validity. This is a critical step in proving the correctness of your solution.\nStudent：Should I substitute $b_{n+1} = (\\frac{1}{3})^{n}$ and $b_n = (\\frac{1}{3})^{n-1}$ into the original recurrence equation and check?\nTeacher：Yes, that is the correct approach. Let's proceed with this verification.\nStudent：$a_n = 2+3(n-1)$, so $a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = (2+3(n-1)) \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n$?\n\nSo, $(2+3(n-1)+1)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n = n\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{n-1}\\ ?$\nTeacher：You have correctly substituted the general term into the recurrence relation, but you have not simplified both sides of the equation properly to verify that they are equal. This is a critical step in confirming the validity of your solution.\nStudent：Should I expand and simplify both sides to check if they match?\nTeacher：Yes, that is the correct next step. Let's proceed with simplifying both sides of the equation to verify their equality.\nStudent：On the left: $[2 + 3(n-1) + 1]\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n = (3n)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n$\n\nOn the right: $n\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$\n\nSo, $3n\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n = n\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$?\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified both sides, but you have not verified that they are equal. This is essential to confirm the validity of your solution.\nStudent：If I further simplify, $3n \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n = n \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$ becomes $n \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$ on both sides, so they are equal.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified both sides and confirmed that they are equal, thereby validating your general term for $ b_n $. Your solution is now complete and accurate.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I understand now.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the general term for $ b_n $ and validated it against the recurrence relation.
