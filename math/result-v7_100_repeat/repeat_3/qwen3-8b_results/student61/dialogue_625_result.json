    "question": "8. (5 points) The Chinese mathematician Chen Jingrun achieved world-leading results in the study of Goldbach's Conjecture. Goldbach's Conjecture states that 'every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes', for example, $30=7+23$. If two distinct numbers are randomly selected from the prime numbers not exceeding 30, what is the probability that their sum is 30?

Did you consider other pairs like (7, 23) or (11, 19)?\nStudent：I didn't think to try all combinations systematically, and only checked a few pairs that seemed likely. I missed (7, 23) and (11, 19).\nTeacher：You missed the valid pairs (7, 23) and (11, 19). Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes, not 1.\nStudent：zzc",
