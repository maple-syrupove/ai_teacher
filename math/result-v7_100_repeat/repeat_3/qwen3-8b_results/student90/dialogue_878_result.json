You incorrectly computed the conjugate of the denominator.\nStudent：Actually, I took the conjugate just by flipping the sign of the imaginary part in both numerator and denominator.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in the computation of $ \\bar{z} $. You incorrectly assumed that taking the conjugate of a complex fraction involves only flipping the sign of the imaginary part in both numerator and denominator, without properly applying the conjugate to the entire denominator.\nStudent：I thought you take the conjugate by changing signs in both numerator and denominator, so that's what I did.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in the assumption that conjugating a complex fraction involves simply flipping the signs of both numerator and denominator. The correct approach requires conjugating the entire denominator, not just flipping its sign arbitrarily.\nStudent：I see. I just changed the signs in both numerator and denominator when finding the conjugate.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in the assumption that conjugating a complex fraction involves flipping the signs of both numerator and denominator. The correct approach requires conjugating the entire denominator, not just flipping its sign arbitrarily.\nStudent：I understand.

The correct approach requires conjugating the entire denominator, not just flipping its sign arbitrarily.\nStudent：I understand. I tried subtracting the two fractions directly after flipping the signs to get $z-\\bar{z}$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in the direct subtraction of the two fractions without first simplifying $ z $ and $ \\bar{z} $ correctly.
