    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A.\nTeacher：Let me ask you: If $\\{a_n\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence, what form does $S_n$ take? And what does that imply about $\\frac{S_n}{n}$?\nStudent：If $\\{a_n\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence, $S_n$ is a quadratic function of $n$, so $\\frac{S_n}{n}$ is a linear function of $n$.\nTeacher：You're correct that if $\\{a_n\\}$ is arithmetic, $S_n$ is quadratic and $\\frac{S_n}{n}$ is linear. But does the converse hold? Could $\\frac{S_n}{n}$ be linear without $\\{a_n\\}$ being arithmetic?\nStudent：If $\\frac{S_n}{n}$ is linear, then $S_n$ is quadratic in $n$. But $a_n = S_n - S_{n-1}$ might not necessarily form an arithmetic sequence; it would depend on the specific form of $S_n$.\nTeacher：You are on the right track. Let me ask: If $\\frac{S_n}{n}$ is linear, does that always mean $S_n$ is a quadratic function of $n$? And if so, does that guarantee that $a_n = S_n - S_{n-1}$ is arithmetic?\nStudent：If $\\frac{S_n}{n}$ is linear, then $S_n$ must be quadratic in $n$. But whether $a_n = S_n - S_{n-1}$ is arithmetic depends on the coefficients of $S_n$, so it's not always guaranteed.\nTeacher：You have identified the key issue. The error in your initial choice of A is that you assumed the sufficiency of A for B without considering cases where B holds independently of A. Therefore, A is not a necessary condition for B.\nStudent：zzc",
