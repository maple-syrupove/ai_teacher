    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：2\nTeacher：What is the relationship between $ |z_1 + z_2| $ and $ |z_1 - z_2| $ when $ |z_1| = |z_2| $?\nStudent：If $|z_1| = |z_2| = r$, then $|z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 4r^2$.\nTeacher：You correctly recalled the identity, but did you use it properly? Let's compute $ |z_1 + z_2|^2 $ first.\nStudent：$|z_1 + z_2|^2 = |\\sqrt{3} + i|^2 = (\\sqrt{3})^2 + (1)^2 = 3 + 1 = 4$.\nTeacher：You have computed $ |z_1 + z_2|^2 = 4 $. Using the identity $ |z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 4r^2 $, with $ r = 2 $, what is $ 4r^2 $?\nStudent：$4r^2 = 4 \\times (2)^2 = 4 \\times 4 = 16$.\nTeacher：You have $ |z_1 + z_2|^2 = 4 $ and $ 4r^2 = 16 $. Using the identity, what is $ |z_1 - z_2|^2 $?\nStudent：$|z_1 - z_2|^2 = 16 - 4 = 12$.\nTeacher：Then, $ |z_1 - z_2| = \\sqrt{12} $. However, your answer of 2 is incorrect. You have not simplified $ \\sqrt{12} $ properly. What is $ \\sqrt{12} $ in its simplest radical form?\nStudent：$\\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\nTeacher：Your final answer of $ 2\\sqrt{3} $ is correct, but your initial answer of 2 was incorrect. You did not simplify $ \\sqrt{12} $ properly.\nStudent：I don't think that was my mistake. I thought the answer was 2 because of the magnitudes.\nTeacher：You assumed the answer was 2 based on the magnitudes of $ z_1 $ and $ z_2 $, but this ignores the geometric relationship between $ z_1 + z_2 $ and $ z_1 - z_2 $. The correct value is $ 2\\sqrt{3} $.\nStudent：zzc",
