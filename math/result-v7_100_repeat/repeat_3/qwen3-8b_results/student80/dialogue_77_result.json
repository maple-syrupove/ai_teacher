    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I got $d = \\frac{|2-8|}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{5}}$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of the distance uses the point (2, -8), but this is not the correct coordinates of the right focus of the hyperbola. What are the coordinates of the foci for this hyperbola?\nStudent：I didn't find the coordinates of the foci—I directly used the vertex at $(2, 0)$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly used the vertex coordinates instead of the foci coordinates for the hyperbola. What is the formula for finding the foci of a hyperbola of the form $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$?\nStudent：The foci are at $(\\pm c, 0)$, where $c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the formula for the foci, but you did not compute $ c $ properly. What is the value of $ c $ for this hyperbola?\nStudent：For this hyperbola, $a^2 = 4$, $b^2 = 5$, so $c = \\sqrt{4+5} = 3$.\nTeacher：Teacher：You correctly calculated $ c = 3 $, so the right focus is at $ (3, 0) $. However, you used the point $ (2, -8) $ in your distance formula. What is the correct point to use for the right focus?\nStudent：The correct point to use is $(3, 0)$.\nTeacher：You now have the correct focus point $(3, 0)$. However, you used the incorrect formula for the distance from a point to a line. What is the correct formula for the distance from a point $(x_0, y_0)$ to the line $Ax + By + C = 0$?\nStudent：The correct formula is $d = \\frac{|A x_0 + B y_0 + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}$.\nTeacher：You now have the correct formula, but you did not substitute the coordinates of the focus $(3, 0)$ into the formula properly. What is the value of $A x_0 + B y_0 + C$ when $(x_0, y_0) = (3, 0)$ and the line is $x + 2y - 8 = 0$?\nStudent：When $(x_0, y_0) = (3, 0)$, $A x_0 + B y_0 + C = 3 + 2 \\times 0 - 8 = 3 - 8 = -5$.\nTeacher：The absolute value of $-5$ is $5$, but you did not include it in your final calculation. What is the correct value of the numerator in the distance formula?\nStudent：The correct numerator is $|3 + 2 \\times 0 - 8| = |-5| = 5$.\nTeacher：The correct numerator is $5$, but you did not divide by $\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}$. What is the value of $\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}$ for the line $x + 2y - 8 = 0$?\nStudent：The value of $\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}$ is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5}$.\nTeacher：The correct distance is $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\sqrt{5}$. Your final answer was incorrect because you did not compute the distance properly after correcting the numerator.\nStudent：Okay, the correct distance should be $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\sqrt{5}$.\nTeacher：You have now arrived at the correct final answer, $\\sqrt{5}$. Well done.\nStudent：Thank you! I'll be more careful distinguishing between the vertex and the focus in the future.\nTeacher：You have now arrived at the correct final answer, $\\sqrt{5}$. Well done.\nStudent：Thank you! I'll remember to find the right point next time.\nTeacher：You're welcome! I'm glad we could clarify the process. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Have a great day!\nStudent：Thank you, teacher! I will double-check the required point next time.\nTeacher：You're welcome! I'm glad we could clarify the process. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
