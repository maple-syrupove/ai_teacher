    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I think the answer is $\\overrightarrow{E B} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your answer suggests that point E is the same as point B, which is incorrect. Can you explain how you arrived at this conclusion?\nStudent：I saw that $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ points from $E$ to $B$, and since $A$, $D$, and $E$ are on a median, I thought $E$ was just along $AB$, so I took $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that point $E$ lies on segment $AB$, but this is not necessarily true. Can you explain how you determined the position of $E$ relative to the triangle?\nStudent：I thought since $E$ is the midpoint of median $AD$, and $A$ is a vertex, $E$ would just be somewhere between $A$ and $D$, but I didn't calculate its exact coordinates.\nTeacher：Your assumption that $E$ lies on segment $AB$ is incorrect. Can you explain how you determined the relationship between $E$ and the sides of the triangle?\nStudent：I assumed $E$ was just along $AD$, but I didn't really find how it's related to $AB$ or $AC$. I didn't work out its coordinates in terms of $A$, $B$, and $C$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is assuming that the position of $E$ can be directly related to $AB$ without considering its vector relationship with $A$, $B$, and $C$. Can you explain how you would express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of vectors from point $A$?\nStudent：I would try to express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ as a combination of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$ starting from $A$, but I'm not sure how to set it up.\nTeacher：Your error is in not properly expressing $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ as a linear combination of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$ using vector addition and midpoint properties. Can you explain how you would express $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$?\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{AD}$ should be written as the vector from $A$ to the midpoint of $BC$. So, I should calculate the midpoint of $BC$ first using $B$ and $C$.\nTeacher：You are on the right track, but you have not yet considered how to express $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ as a combination of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$. Can you explain how you would find $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ in terms of these vectors?\nStudent：To find $\\overrightarrow{AD}$, first calculate the midpoint $D$ of $BC$: $D = \\frac{1}{2}(B + C)$. Then, $\\overrightarrow{AD} = \\overrightarrow{OD} - \\overrightarrow{OA} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{OB} + \\overrightarrow{OC}) - \\overrightarrow{OA}$. This simplifies to $\\overrightarrow{AD} = \\frac{1}{2}\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\frac{1}{2}\\overrightarrow{AC}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly expressed $\\overrightarrow{AD}$, but you have not yet accounted for the fact that $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$, which affects the final expression for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. Can you explain how you would find $\\overrightarrow{AE}$ using this information?\nStudent：Since $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$, $\\overrightarrow{AE} = \\frac{1}{2} \\overrightarrow{AD} = \\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AB} + \\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AC}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $\\overrightarrow{AE}$, but you have not yet used it to determine $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. Can you explain how you would find $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ using $\\overrightarrow{AE}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AB}$?\nStudent：I would use $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{EA} + \\overrightarrow{AB}$. Since $\\overrightarrow{EA} = -\\overrightarrow{AE}$, I'd have $\\overrightarrow{EB} = -\\overrightarrow{AE} + \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly applied vector addition, but your final expression for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ is not fully simplified. Can you explain how you would simplify $-\\overrightarrow{AE} + \\overrightarrow{AB}$ using your earlier result for $\\overrightarrow{AE}$?\nStudent：Sure. Since $\\overrightarrow{AE} = \\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AB} + \\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AC}$, then $-\\overrightarrow{AE} = -\\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AC}$, so $\\overrightarrow{EB} = -\\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AC} + \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：You have made a mistake in the simplification of $-\\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AC} + \\overrightarrow{AB}$. Can you explain how you combined the terms?\nStudent：I added $-\\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ to get $\\frac{3}{4} \\overrightarrow{AB}$, so it becomes $\\frac{3}{4} \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AC}$.\nTeacher：Your final expression $\\frac{3}{4} \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AC}$ matches option A, which is correct. However, you initially claimed $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$, which was incorrect. Your mistake was in the initial assumption about the position of $E$.\nStudent：zzc",
