    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：y = 3x\nTeacher：What is the derivative of $ y = 3(x^2 + x)e^x $? Have you applied the product rule correctly?\nStudent：I haven't actually calculated the derivative yet; I just used the coefficient 3 directly.\nTeacher：You assumed the derivative of $ y = 3(x^2 + x)e^x $ is simply $ 3x $, but you neglected to apply the product rule and chain rule properly. What is the correct derivative of $ y $?\nStudent：The correct derivative would be:\n\n$y' = 3\\left[ (2x+1)e^x + (x^2+x)e^x \\right]$\nTeacher：You correctly applied the product rule, but you forgot to simplify the expression. What is the simplified form of $ y' $?\nStudent：The simplified form is $y' = 3e^x \\left(2x + 1 + x^2 + x\\right) = 3e^x (x^2 + 3x + 1)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the derivative. Now, what is the value of $ y' $ at $ x = 0 $?\nStudent：At $x = 0$, $y' = 3e^0(0^2 + 3\\cdot0 + 1) = 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 3$.\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated the derivative and evaluated it at $ x = 0 $. What is the equation of the tangent line at $ (0, 0) $?\nStudent：The equation is $y = 3x$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the slope of the tangent line as 3, but you have not used the point-slope form of a line. What is the point-slope form of a line given a point and a slope?\nStudent：The point-slope form is $y - y_0 = k(x - x_0)$, where $(x_0, y_0)$ is the point and $k$ is the slope.\nTeacher：You have correctly recalled the point-slope form. Now, substitute the point $(0, 0)$ and the slope $3$ into the formula. What is the resulting equation?\nStudent：Substituting into the formula: $y - 0 = 3(x - 0)$, which simplifies to $y = 3x$.\nTeacher：You have correctly derived the equation of the tangent line as $ y = 3x $. There is no error in your solution.\nStudent：I used $y = 3x$ as the tangent line equation.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the equation of the tangent line as $ y = 3x $.
