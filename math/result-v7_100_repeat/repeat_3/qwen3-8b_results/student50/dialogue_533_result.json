    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $y= \\pm x$\nTeacher：The eccentricity of a hyperbola is given by $ e = \\frac{c}{a} $, where $ c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $. You have been given $ e = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} $. Did you use this relationship to find the ratio $ \\frac{b}{a} $?\nStudent：No, I didn't use that relationship.\nTeacher：You were asked to find the equation of the asymptotes, which for a hyperbola $ \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 $ is $ y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a}x $. Did you calculate $ \\frac{b}{a} $ using the eccentricity?\nStudent：No, I didn't calculate $\\frac{b}{a}$ using the eccentricity.\nTeacher：You have selected option C, which corresponds to $ \\frac{b}{a} = 1 $. However, the eccentricity $ e = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} $ implies a specific relationship between $ a $ and $ b $. Did you use the formula $ e = \\frac{c}{a} $, where $ c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $, to find $ \\frac{b}{a} $?\nStudent：No, I did not use that formula to find $\\frac{b}{a}$.\nTeacher：You have not used the relationship between eccentricity and the hyperbola's parameters to determine $ \\frac{b}{a} $. This is the key error in your approach.\nStudent：zzc",
