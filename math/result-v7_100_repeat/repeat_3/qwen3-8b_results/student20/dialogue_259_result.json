    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I set $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1$ and $a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 2$ as equations, then tried to solve for $a_6 + a_7 + a_8$ by expressing each term individually.\nTeacher：Let me understand your approach. Did you express $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of $a_1$ and the common ratio $r$?\nStudent：Yes, I wrote $a_2 = a_1 r$ and $a_3 = a_1 r^2$.\nTeacher：Teacher: And how did you express $a_4$ in terms of $a_1$ and $r$?\nStudent：I wrote $a_4 = a_1 r^3$.\nTeacher：Teacher: Then, how did you use the given equations to solve for $a_1$ and $r$?\nStudent：I substituted $a_2 = a_1 r$, $a_3 = a_1 r^2$, and $a_4 = a_1 r^3$ into the equations, getting $a_1 + a_1 r + a_1 r^2 = 1$ and $a_1 r + a_1 r^2 + a_1 r^3 = 2$.\nTeacher：Let me see. Did you factor out $a_1$ from both equations and then divide the second equation by the first to eliminate $a_1$?\nStudent：No, I didn't try dividing the equations to eliminate $a_1$. I just tried to solve them directly.\nTeacher：You didn't eliminate $a_1$ by dividing the equations, which is a key step in simplifying the system. Let me ask: Did you notice that the second equation is the first equation multiplied by $r$?\nStudent：No, I did not notice that relationship between the two equations.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the second equation is the first equation multiplied by the common ratio $ r $. This relationship could have simplified the problem significantly.\nStudent：zzc",
