    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried $x=2, y=0$, got $z=2-0=2$, so the minimum is 2.\nTeacher：Your assumption that $x=2, y=0$ satisfies all constraints is incorrect. Let's verify if this point meets all three inequalities.\nStudent：For $x=2, y=0$:\nFirst constraint: $4(2)-3(0)-3=8-3=5 \\geq 0$, true.\nSecond: $2-2(0)-2=0 \\leq 0$, true.\nThird: $2(2)+6(0)-9=4-9=-5 \\leq 0$, true. So it does satisfy all constraints.\nTeacher：Your calculation of $z=x-5y$ at $x=2, y=0$ is incorrect. You computed $z=2$, but the correct value is $z=2 - 5(0) = 2$. This is not the minimum value. Let's examine other points within the feasible region.\nStudent：Should I try another random point from the boundary to check if $z$ can be smaller?\nTeacher：Let's consider the boundaries of the feasible region. The minimum value of $z = x - 5y$ often occurs at a vertex of the feasible region. Have you identified all the vertices?\nStudent：No, I haven't identified all the vertices yet. I only tried some random points on the boundary.\nTeacher：Let's find the intersection points of the constraints to determine the vertices of the feasible region. Have you solved the system of equations formed by pairs of constraints?\nStudent：No, I haven't solved the system of equations for the intersection points yet.\nTeacher：Let's find the intersection points of the constraints to determine the vertices of the feasible region. Have you solved the system of equations formed by pairs of constraints?\nStudent：No, I haven’t solved the systems for those intersection points yet.\nTeacher：Let's start by solving the system of equations formed by the first two constraints: $4x - 3y = 3$ and $x - 2y = 2$. Have you attempted this?\nStudent：No, I haven't attempted to solve that system yet.\nTeacher：Let's solve the system of equations $4x - 3y = 3$ and $x - 2y = 2$.
