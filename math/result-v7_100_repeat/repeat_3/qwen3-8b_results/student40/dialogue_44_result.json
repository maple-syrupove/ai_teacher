    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：The length is 3, so the diameter is 3. The radius is 1.5, so the surface area is 9π.\nTeacher：Your assumption that the length is the diameter of the sphere is incorrect. What is the relationship between the cuboid's diagonal and the sphere's diameter?\nStudent：The cuboid's diagonal is the line connecting two opposite corners through the interior of the cuboid.\nTeacher：The cuboid's diagonal is the diameter of the sphere. What is the formula for the space diagonal of a cuboid?\nStudent：The formula for the space diagonal of a cuboid with sides a, b, and c is $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$.\nTeacher：The space diagonal of the cuboid is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{14}$. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is $\\sqrt{14}$, and the radius is $\\frac{\\sqrt{14}}{2}$. You incorrectly used the length as the diameter instead of the space diagonal.\nStudent：zzc",
