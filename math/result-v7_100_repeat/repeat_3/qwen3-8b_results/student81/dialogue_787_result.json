    "correct_answer": "Solution: (1) We are given an arithmetic sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ with the first term $a_1 = -7$.\nWe are also given that the sum of the first 3 terms is $S_3 = -15$.\nThe formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$, where $d$ is the common difference.\nFor $n=3$, we have:\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + (3-1)d) = -15$\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + 2d) = 3(a_1+d) = -15$.\nDivide by 3: $a_1 + d = -5$.\nSubstitute the given value $a_1 = -7$:\n$-7 + d = -5$\n$d = 2$.\n\nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting $a_1=-7$ and $d=2$:\n$a_n = -7 + (n-1)2 = -7 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 9$.\n\n(2) To find the formula for $S_n$, we use the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$.\n$S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(-7 + (2n-9)) = \\frac{n}{2}(2n - 16) = n(n-8) = n^2 - 8n$.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $S_n$, we can treat $S_n = n^2 - 8n$ as a quadratic function of $n$. This is an upward-opening parabola. Its minimum value occurs at the vertex.\nThe vertex of a parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is at $x = -b/(2a)$.\nFor our function, the vertex is at $n = -(-8)/(2\\cdot1) = 4$.\nSince $n=4$ is a positive integer, the minimum value of the sequence $S_n$ occurs at $n=4$.\nLet's find the value of $S_4$:\n$S_4 = 4^2 - 8(4) = 16 - 32 = -16$.\nAlternatively, we can complete the square for $S_n$: \n$S_n = n^2 - 8n = (n^2 - 8n + 16) - 16 = (n-4)^2 - 16$.\nThe minimum value of this expression is -16, which occurs when $n=4$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $S_n$ is -16.",

What is the common difference of the sequence?\nStudent：The common difference I got was $d = -4$.\nTeacher：Your common difference is incorrect. What is the value of $a_2$?\nStudent：$a_2 = a_1 + d = -7 + (-4) = -11$\nTeacher：Your value for $a_2$ is incorrect. What is the correct value of $a_2$?\nStudent：$a_2 = S_2 - S_1 = (a_1 + a_2) - a_1 = a_2$, but I don't have $S_2$.\nTeacher：What is the value of $S_3$ given in the problem?\nStudent：$S_3 = -15$\nTeacher：The value of $S_3$ is given as $-15$. Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence, $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$, substitute $n=3$, $S_3=-15$, and $a_1=-7$ to find the common difference $d$. What value do you get for $d$?\nStudent：Substituting in: $-15 = \\frac{3}{2}(2 \\times -7 + 2d)$. So, $-15 = \\frac{3}{2}(-14 + 2d)$. $-15 = \\frac{3}{2}(-14 + 2d)$. Solving: $-15 \\times 2 = 3(-14 + 2d)$, $-30 = -42 + 6d$, $12 = 6d$, $d = 2$.\nTeacher：Your common difference is now correct.
