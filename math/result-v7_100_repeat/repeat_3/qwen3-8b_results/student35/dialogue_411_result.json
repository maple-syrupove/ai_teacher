    "question": "22. In the Cartesian coordinate system $xOy$, a polar coordinate system is established with the origin as the pole and the positive x-axis as the polar axis. The polar equation of a curve $C$ is $\\rho=2 \\sqrt{2} \\cos \\theta$.\n\n(1) Convert the polar equation of C to a Cartesian equation.\n\n(2) Let point A have Cartesian coordinates $(1,0)$, and let M be a moving point on C. Point P satisfies the vector equation $\\overrightarrow{A P}=\\sqrt{2} \\overrightarrow{A M}$. Write the parametric equation of the locus of P, denoted as $C_{1}$, and determine if C and $C_{1}$ have any common points.\n",
    "correct_answer": "【Detailed Explanation】(1) The polar equation of curve C is $\\rho=2 \\sqrt{2} \\cos \\theta$.\nTo convert to a Cartesian equation, we can multiply both sides by $\\rho$ (assuming $\\rho \\neq 0$. If $\\rho=0$, the point is the origin, which is included in the resulting equation).\n$\\rho^{2}=2 \\sqrt{2} \\rho \\cos \\theta$.\nUsing the conversion formulas $x^2+y^2 = \\rho^2$ and $x = \\rho\\cos\\theta$, we substitute them into the equation:\n$x^{2}+y^{2}=2 \\sqrt{2} x$.\nRearranging and completing the square to identify the shape:\n$x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + y^2 = 0$\n$(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + (\\sqrt{2})^2) - (\\sqrt{2})^2 + y^2 = 0$\n$(x-\\sqrt{2})^{2} + y^{2} = 2$.\nThis is the equation of a circle C with center $(\\sqrt{2}, 0)$ and radius $r = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\n(2) Let the coordinates of P be $(x, y)$.\nSince M is a moving point on the circle C, we can represent its coordinates parametrically. The center of C is $(\\sqrt{2}, 0)$ and its radius is $\\sqrt{2}$. So, a parametric representation for M is:\n$M(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2}\\cos\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}\\sin\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha$ is the parameter.\n\nWe are given the vector relation $\\overrightarrow{AP} = \\sqrt{2}\\overrightarrow{AM}$.\nLet's write the vectors in terms of coordinates. A is $(1,0)$.\n$\\overrightarrow{AP} = (x-1, y-0) = (x-1, y)$.\n$\\overrightarrow{AM} = ((\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2}\\cos\\alpha) - 1, (\\sqrt{2}\\sin\\alpha) - 0) = (\\sqrt{2}-1 + \\sqrt{2}\\cos\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}\\sin\\alpha)$.\n\nNow, substitute these into the vector equation:\n$(x-1, y) = \\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{2}-1 + \\sqrt{2}\\cos\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}\\sin\\alpha)$\n$(x-1, y) = (2 - \\sqrt{2} + 2\\cos\\alpha, 2\\sin\\alpha)$.\nEquating the components, we get the parametric equations for P:\n$x-1 = 2 - \\sqrt{2} + 2\\cos\\alpha \\implies x = 3 - \\sqrt{2} + 2\\cos\\alpha$\n$y = 2\\sin\\alpha$\nSo, the parametric equations for the locus $C_1$ are $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}x=3-\\sqrt{2}+2 \\cos \\alpha \\\\ y=2 \\sin \\alpha\\end{array}\\right.$ (where $\\alpha$ is the parameter).\n\nThis is a circle $C_1$ with center $(3-\\sqrt{2}, 0)$ and radius $R=2$.\n\nTo determine if C and $C_1$ have common points, we compare the distance between their centers with the sum and difference of their radii.\nCenter of C: $(\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, radius $r = \\sqrt{2}$.\nCenter of $C_1$: $(3-\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, radius $R=2$.\nDistance between centers, $d = |(3-\\sqrt{2}) - \\sqrt{2}| = |3-2\\sqrt{2}|$. \nSince $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$, $2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.828$, so $3-2\\sqrt{2}$ is positive. $d = 3-2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.172$.\n\nSum of radii: $R+r = 2 + \\sqrt{2} \\approx 3.414$.\nDifference of radii: $|R-r| = |2 - \\sqrt{2}| = 2 - \\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.586$.\n\nWe compare the distance $d$ with the sum and difference of radii. \n$d = 3-2\\sqrt{2}$. Is $d < R-r$? Is $3-2\\sqrt{2} < 2-\\sqrt{2}$? \nThis simplifies to $1 < \\sqrt{2}$, which is true.\nSince the distance between the centers is less than the difference of the radii ($d < |R-r|$), one circle is contained entirely within the other and they do not touch. Therefore, the two circles have no common points.\n",

The polar equation $ \\rho = 2\\sqrt{2} \\cos \\theta $ does not directly give $ M $ as $ (2\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\theta, 2\\sqrt{2}\\sin\\theta) $.\nStudent：I used the form $(\\rho\\cos\\theta, \\rho\\sin\\theta)$ for $M$, substituting $\\rho=2\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\theta$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in the interpretation of the polar equation. The coordinates of $ M $ should be $ (\\rho \\cos \\theta, \\rho \\sin \\theta) $, where $ \\rho = 2\\sqrt{2} \\cos \\theta $. Thus, $ M $ is $ (2\\sqrt{2} \\cos^2 \\theta, 2\\sqrt{2} \\cos \\theta \\sin \\theta) $.\nStudent：That's right, after substituting, $M$ becomes $(2\\sqrt{2}\\cos^2\\theta, 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta)$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in the parametric equations for point $ P $. You used $ \\theta $ as the parameter for both $ M $ and $ P $, but $ \\theta $ in the polar equation of $ C $ is not the same parameter as the one used for $ P $.\nStudent：I used the same parameter $\\theta$ for both $M$ on $C$ and for $P$, letting $P$'s coordinates depend on the same $\\theta$ as $M$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in assuming that the parameter $ \\theta $ used for point $ M $ on curve $ C $ is the same as the parameter for point $ P $.

The parameter for $ P $ should be independent and not necessarily tied to the same $ \\theta $ as $ M $.\nStudent：I thought using the same $\\theta$ would allow me to express $P$'s coordinates directly in terms of $\\theta$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in assuming that using the same parameter $ \\theta $ for both $ M $ and $ P $ is valid when deriving the parametric equations for $ P $.
