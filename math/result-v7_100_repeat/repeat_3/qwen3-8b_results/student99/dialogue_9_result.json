    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Insufficient information.\nTeacher：The problem provides enough information. What assumptions did you make that led you to conclude there is insufficient data?\nStudent：I assumed that I couldn't find |b| because I couldn't directly relate |2a - b| and the other conditions to eliminate variables.\nTeacher：What is the formula for the magnitude of a vector difference, such as $ |2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}| $?\nStudent：The formula is $\\sqrt{|2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2}$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the formula for the magnitude of a vector difference. The correct formula is $ |2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = |2\\vec{a}|^2 + |\\vec{b}|^2 - 2(2\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}) $. You missed the proper expansion of the dot product.\nStudent：I don't think I made a mistake in the expansion. I used the expression with the dot product term included.\nTeacher：You have not correctly expanded the square of the vector difference. The correct expansion is $ |2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = (2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}) \\cdot (2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}) $. You omitted the cross terms properly.\nStudent：I used the formula as $\\sqrt{|2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2}$, which includes the cross term $-4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly simplified the expression for $ |2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 $. The correct expansion is $ |2\\vec{a}|^2 + |\\vec{b}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $, not $ |2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2 $. You have misapplied the order of operations in the dot product.\nStudent：I followed the formula as $\\sqrt{|2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2}$ when expanding.\nTeacher：You have misapplied the formula for the magnitude squared. The correct expression is $ |2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = |2\\vec{a}|^2 + |\\vec{b}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $. You incorrectly included an extra term.\nStudent：I thought the cross term $-4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$ came after $|2\\vec{a}|^2$, so I wrote it that way.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed the order of terms in the expansion. The correct expansion is $ |2\\vec{a}|^2 + |\\vec{b}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $. You misapplied the structure of the formula.\nStudent：I thought the way I wrote the terms was still correct since the signs matched, so I used that order when expanding.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that the order of terms in the expansion affects the correctness of the formula. The correct expression is $ |2\\vec{a}|^2 + |\\vec{b}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $. You misapplied the structure of the formula.\nStudent：I thought the arrangement of the terms didn't matter as long as I had $-4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$ included.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that the arrangement of terms in the expansion does not affect the correctness of the formula. The correct expression is $ |2\\vec{a}|^2 + |\\vec{b}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $. You misapplied the structure of the formula.\nStudent：I still think my way of writing the expansion is valid if the terms are all included, so I kept it that way.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assume that the order of terms in the expansion does not affect the correctness of the formula. The correct expression is $ |2\\vec{a}|^2 + |\\vec{b}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $. You misapplied the structure of the formula.\nStudent：I still believe having $-4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$ and all the terms included is fine, so I didn't change it.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assume that the order of terms in the expansion does not affect the correctness of the formula. The correct expression is $ |2\\vec{a}|^2 + |\\vec{b}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $. You misapplied the structure of the formula.\nStudent：I still listed the terms as $|2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2$ when writing the expansion.\nTeacher：You incorrectly ordered the terms in the expansion, which led to an incorrect expression for $ |2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 $. The correct order is $ |2\\vec{a}|^2 + |\\vec{b}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $.\nStudent：I wrote it as $|2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2$ in my solution.\nTeacher：You incorrectly ordered the terms in the expansion, which led to an incorrect expression for $ |2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 $.
