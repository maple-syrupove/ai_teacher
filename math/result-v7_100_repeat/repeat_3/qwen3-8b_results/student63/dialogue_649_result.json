    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D (α and β are perpendicular to the same plane).\nTeacher：The condition in D ensures that α and β are parallel, but does it guarantee that they are parallel? Let me ask: Can two planes be perpendicular to the same plane but not parallel to each other?\nStudent：Yes, two planes can both be perpendicular to the same plane but still not be parallel to each other.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that D is not a sufficient condition. Let me ask: What is the definition of two planes being parallel?\nStudent：Two planes are parallel if they do not intersect and are always the same distance apart.\nTeacher：You mentioned that parallel planes do not intersect. Let me ask: Can two planes have infinitely many lines parallel to each other without intersecting?\nStudent：Yes, two planes that have infinitely many parallel lines and do not intersect are parallel.\nTeacher：You are conflating the existence of parallel lines with the definition of parallel planes. Let me ask: What is the precise condition for two planes to be parallel?\nStudent：The precise condition is that they do not intersect and the distance between them is constant everywhere.\nTeacher：You are still conflating the existence of parallel lines with the definition of parallel planes. Let me ask: What is the correct necessary and sufficient condition for two planes to be parallel?\nStudent：The correct necessary and sufficient condition is that the planes do not intersect and the distance between them is constant everywhere.\nTeacher：The correct necessary and sufficient condition for two planes to be parallel is that they contain two intersecting lines, each of which is parallel to the other plane. You have not yet identified the correct condition. Let me ask: What does it mean for a line in one plane to be parallel to another plane?\nStudent：A line in one plane is parallel to another plane if it does not intersect that plane, no matter how far it is extended.\nTeacher：You have not yet identified the correct condition. Let me ask: If a line in one plane is parallel to another plane, what does that imply about the relationship between the two planes?\nStudent：If a line in one plane is parallel to another plane, it means that the line does not intersect that plane and is not contained in it.\nTeacher：You are still not identifying the correct condition. Let me ask: If two planes are parallel, what can you say about the lines in one plane relative to the other plane?\nStudent：If two planes are parallel, every line in one plane is either parallel to the other plane or lies in a direction parallel to it.\nTeacher：If two planes are parallel, every line in one plane is parallel to the other plane. You have not yet identified the correct condition. Let me ask: What is the precise necessary and sufficient condition for two planes to be parallel?\nStudent：The precise necessary and sufficient condition is that the two planes do not intersect and are always the same distance apart.\nTeacher：You have not yet identified the correct condition. Let me ask: What is the precise necessary and sufficient condition for two planes to be parallel?\nStudent：The precise necessary and sufficient condition is that the two planes do not intersect and the distance between them is constant everywhere.\nTeacher：You have not yet identified the correct condition. Let me ask: What is the precise necessary and sufficient condition for two planes to be parallel?\nStudent：The precise necessary and sufficient condition is that the two planes do not intersect and the distance between them is constant everywhere.\nTeacher：You have not yet identified the correct condition. Let me ask: What is the relationship between two planes if they contain two intersecting lines, each of which is parallel to the other plane?\nStudent：If two planes each contain two intersecting lines, and each of these lines is parallel to the other plane, then the two planes are parallel.\nTeacher：You have now identified the correct condition. The error in your initial choice of D was not recognizing that it is not a sufficient condition for parallelism. The correct necessary and sufficient condition is that two planes contain two intersecting lines, each of which is parallel to the other plane.\nStudent：zzc",
