If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. 3\nTeacher：Your answer is incorrect. Let's consider the condition $x - y \\in A$. What values of $x$ and $y$ satisfy this condition?\nStudent：I tried values like $x=2, y=1$ (since $2-1=1$), $x=3, y=2$, $x=4, y=3$, and $x=5, y=4$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning is incomplete. Have you considered all possible pairs $(x, y)$ where $x - y \\in A$? For example, what about cases where $x - y = 2$ or $x - y = 3$?\nStudent：I didn't check every possible value for $x - y$, like $2$ or $3$. I only did a few examples.\nTeacher：Your error is that you only considered specific cases and did not systematically check all possible pairs $(x, y)$ where $x - y \\in A$. Let's examine all such pairs.\nStudent：zzc",
