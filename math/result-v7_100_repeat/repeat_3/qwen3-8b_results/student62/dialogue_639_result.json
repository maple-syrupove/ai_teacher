    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option C, that is, $c<a<b$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that all three values are negative, but $b$ and $c$ are positive. This is a critical error. Let me ask: Are $b$ and $c$ positive or negative?\nStudent：$b$ and $c$ are both positive values.\nTeacher：Your reasoning still contains a flaw. Let me ask: What is the sign of $a = \\log_2 0.2$?\nStudent：$a$ is negative because $0.2 < 1$, so $\\log_2 0.2 < 0$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the sign of $a$, but your conclusion about the order $c < a < b$ is still incorrect. Let me ask: Is $a$ less than $c$ or greater than $c$?\nStudent：I think $a$ is less than $c$.\nTeacher：You have incorrectly assumed that $a < c$, but this is not necessarily true. Let me ask: Is $a = \\log_2 0.2$ greater than or less than $c = 0.2^{0.3}$?\nStudent：I think $a$ is less than $c$.\nTeacher：You have incorrectly compared $a = \\log_2 0.2$ and $c = 0.2^{0.3}$. The mistake lies in assuming their relationship without proper analysis. Let me ask: Is $a = \\log_2 0.2$ greater than or less than $c = 0.2^{0.3}$?\nStudent：I think $a$ is less than $c$.\nTeacher：You have incorrectly compared $a = \\log_2 0.2$ and $c = 0.2^{0.3}$. The mistake lies in assuming their relationship without proper analysis. Let me ask: Is $a = \\log_2 0.2$ greater than or less than $c = 0.2^{0.3}$?\nStudent：I still think $a$ is less than $c$.\nTeacher：You have incorrectly assumed that $a < c$ without proper analysis. Let me ask: Is $a = \\log_2 0.2$ greater than or less than $c = 0.2^{0.3}$?\nStudent：I believe $a$ is less than $c$.\nTeacher：You have incorrectly assumed that $a < c$ without proper analysis.
