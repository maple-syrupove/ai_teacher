    "question": "17. The sides opposite to the interior angles A, B, C of $\\triangle ABC$ are $a, b, c$ respectively. Suppose $(\\sin B-\\sin C)^{2}=\\sin ^{2} A-\\sin B \\sin C$.\n\n(1) Find the measure of angle A.\n\n(2) If $\\sqrt{2} a+b=2 c$, find $\\sin C$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "【Detailed Explanation】(1) We are given the equation $(\\sin B-\\sin C)^{2}=\\sin ^{2} A-\\sin B \\sin C$.\nExpand the left side:\n$\\sin^2 B - 2\\sin B \\sin C + \\sin^2 C = \\sin^2 A - \\sin B \\sin C$.\nRearrange the terms to group the squares on one side:\n$\\sin^2 B + \\sin^2 C - \\sin^2 A = 2\\sin B \\sin C - \\sin B \\sin C$\n$\\sin^2 B + \\sin^2 C - \\sin^2 A = \\sin B \\sin C$.\n\nBy the Law of Sines, $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C} = k$. So, $\\sin A = a/k, \\sin B = b/k, \\sin C = c/k$.\nSubstitute these into the equation:\n$(b/k)^2 + (c/k)^2 - (a/k)^2 = (b/k)(c/k)$.\nMultiply the entire equation by $k^2$:\n$b^2 + c^2 - a^2 = bc$.\n\nFrom the Law of Cosines, we know that $\\cos A = \\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}$.\nSubstitute the result we just found:\n$\\cos A = \\frac{bc}{2bc} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince A is an angle in a triangle, $A \\in (0, \\pi)$. The angle A for which $\\cos A = 1/2$ is $A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\n(2) We are given $\\sqrt{2} a+b=2 c$. Using the Law of Sines again, this becomes:\n$\\sqrt{2}k\\sin A + k\\sin B = 2k\\sin C$.\n$\\sqrt{2}\\sin A + \\sin B = 2\\sin C$.\nWe know $A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and $B = \\pi - (A+C) = \\pi - (\\frac{\\pi}{3}+C)$.\nSo, $\\sin B = \\sin(\\pi - (\\frac{\\pi}{3}+C)) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}+C) = \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\cos C + \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\sin C = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos C + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin C$.\n\nSubstitute $\\sin A = \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and the expression for $\\sin B$ into the equation:\n$\\sqrt{2}(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos C + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin C) = 2\\sin C$.\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos C = 2\\sin C - \\frac{1}{2}\\sin C = \\frac{3}{2}\\sin C$.\nMultiply by 2: $\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{3}\\cos C = 3\\sin C$.\n$3\\sin C - \\sqrt{3}\\cos C = \\sqrt{6}$.\n\nWe can solve this using the R-formula, $R\\sin(C-\\alpha)$. Here $R = \\sqrt{3^2 + (-\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{9+3} = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n$2\\sqrt{3}(\\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\sin C - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\cos C) = \\sqrt{6}$.\n$2\\sqrt{3}(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\sin C - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos C) = \\sqrt{6}$.\n$2\\sqrt{3}\\sin(C - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\sqrt{6}$.\n$\\sin(C - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\nSince $A=\\frac{\\pi}{3}$, we have $0 < C < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, so $-\\frac{\\pi}{6} < C-\\frac{\\pi}{6} < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nIn this range, the only solution to $\\sin(C - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ is $C - \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n$C = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{3\\pi+2\\pi}{12} = \\frac{5\\pi}{12}$.\n\nWe need to find $\\sin C = \\sin(\\frac{5\\pi}{12})$.\n$\\sin(\\frac{5\\pi}{12}) = \\sin(75^{\\circ}) = \\sin(45^{\\circ}+30^{\\circ}) = \\sin 45^{\\circ}\\cos 30^{\\circ} + \\cos 45^{\\circ}\\sin 30^{\\circ}$\n$= \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{4}$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I divided both sides of the equation $\\sqrt{2}a + b = 2c$ by $a$, so I got $\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{b}{a} = 2\\frac{c}{a}$.\nTeacher：Using the Law of Sines, $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C} = 2R$. What relationship does this imply between $\\frac{b}{a}$ and $\\frac{c}{a}$?\nStudent：It implies that $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin B}{\\sin A}$ and $\\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{\\sin C}{\\sin A}$.\nTeacher：Using these relationships, substitute $\\frac{b}{a}$ and $\\frac{c}{a}$ into the equation $\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{b}{a} = 2\\frac{c}{a}$. What equation do you get in terms of $\\sin B$ and $\\sin C$?\nStudent：Substituting, I get: $\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{\\sin B}{\\sin A} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sin C}{\\sin A}$.\nTeacher：Multiplying both sides by $\\sin A$, what equation do you obtain?\nStudent：Multiplying both sides by $\\sin A$, I get: $\\sqrt{2}\\sin A + \\sin B = 2\\sin C$.\nTeacher：You have now expressed the relationship between the sines of angles B and C in terms of angle A. What is the value of angle A from part (1)?\nStudent：From part (1), angle A is $90^\\circ$.\nTeacher：Given that angle A is $90^\\circ$, what is the value of $\\sin A$?\nStudent：The value of $\\sin A$ is $1$.\nTeacher：Given that $\\sin A = 1$, substitute this into the equation $\\sqrt{2}\\sin A + \\sin B = 2\\sin C$. What equation do you get?\nStudent：Substituting $\\sin A = 1$, the equation becomes: $\\sqrt{2} \\times 1 + \\sin B = 2\\sin C$, or $\\sqrt{2} + \\sin B = 2\\sin C$.\nTeacher：Given that angle A is $90^\\circ$, the triangle is right-angled at A. Therefore, angles B and C are complementary, meaning $B + C = 90^\\circ$. What is the relationship between $\\sin B$ and $\\sin C$ in this case?\nStudent：Since $B + C = 90^\\circ$, $\\sin B = \\cos C$ and $\\sin C = \\cos B$.\nTeacher：You have established that $\\sin B = \\cos C$. Substitute this into the equation $\\sqrt{2} + \\sin B = 2\\sin C$. What equation do you get?\nStudent：Substituting $\\sin B = \\cos C$, the equation becomes: $\\sqrt{2} + \\cos C = 2\\sin C$.\nTeacher：Now, rewrite the equation $\\sqrt{2} + \\cos C = 2\\sin C$ in terms of a single trigonometric function. What identity can you use?\nStudent：I can use the identity $\\sin^2 C + \\cos^2 C = 1$ to express everything in terms of $\\sin C$. So, $\\cos C = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 C}$.\nTeacher：Let $ x = \\sin C $. Then the equation becomes $ \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x $. What is your next step?\nStudent：My next step is to isolate the square root: $\\sqrt{1-x^2} = 2x - \\sqrt{2}$, then square both sides to remove the square root.\nTeacher：Squaring both sides, you get $1 - x^2 = (2x - \\sqrt{2})^2$. Did you expand the right-hand side correctly?\nStudent：I expanded it as $1 - x^2 = 4x^2 - 4\\sqrt{2}x + 2$.\nTeacher：Your expansion of $ (2x - \\sqrt{2})^2 $ is incorrect. The correct expansion is $ 4x^2 - 4\\sqrt{2}x + 2 $.\nStudent：Yes, I see now: $(2x - \\sqrt{2})^2 = 4x^2 - 4\\sqrt{2}x + 2$.\nTeacher：You have corrected your expansion. Now, simplify the equation $1 - x^2 = 4x^2 - 4\\sqrt{2}x + 2$. Did you move all terms to one side correctly?\nStudent：Yes, after moving all terms to one side, I get: $1 - x^2 - 4x^2 + 4\\sqrt{2}x - 2 = 0$.\nTeacher：Simplify the left-hand side: $ -5x^2 + 4\\sqrt{2}x - 1 = 0 $. Did you multiply through by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive?\nStudent：Yes, after multiplying by $-1$, the equation becomes $5x^2 - 4\\sqrt{2}x + 1 = 0$.\nTeacher：You have now obtained a quadratic equation in $ x $. Did you solve it using the quadratic formula?\nStudent：Yes, I used the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2} \\pm \\sqrt{(4\\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 1}}{2 \\cdot 5}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly applied the quadratic formula. What is the discriminant of this equation?\nStudent：The discriminant is $(4\\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 1 = 32 - 20 = 12$.\nTeacher：The discriminant is $12$. What are the two solutions for $x$?\nStudent：The two solutions are $x = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2} + 2\\sqrt{3}}{10}$ and $x = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2} - 2\\sqrt{3}}{10}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated the solutions for $ x $. However, you must check which solution is valid by substituting back into the original equation $ \\sqrt{2} + \\cos C = 2\\sin C $, as squaring can introduce extraneous solutions. Have you done this?\nStudent：No, I haven't yet checked which of the two solutions is valid in the original equation.\nTeacher：You have not yet verified which solution satisfies the original equation, which is essential to ensure correctness. Please check both solutions in the original equation.\nStudent：Let me check the first solution: $x = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2} + 2\\sqrt{3}}{10}$. I will compute $\\cos C = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$ and substitute into the equation $\\sqrt{2} + \\cos C = 2x$.\nTeacher：You have not yet completed the verification process. Have you substituted both solutions into the original equation and determined which one is valid?",
