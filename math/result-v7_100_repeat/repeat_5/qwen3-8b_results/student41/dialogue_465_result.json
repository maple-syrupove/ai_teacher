    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: The maximum value is approximately $2.484$.\nTeacher：What method did you use to find the maximum value of the function?\nStudent：I tried to rewrite the function by completing the square, focusing on the $\\sin^2 x$ term.\nTeacher：What did you do with the $\\sin^2 x$ term specifically?\nStudent：I rewrote $\\sin^2 x$ as $(\\sin x)^2$ and tried to form a square by combining it with other terms.\nTeacher：You attempted to complete the square, but you did not account for the interaction between $\\sin^2 x$ and $\\cos x$. This approach is incomplete. What is the relationship between $\\sin^2 x$ and $\\cos x$?\nStudent：$\\sin^2 x$ and $\\cos x$ are both trigonometric functions of $x$, and $\\sin^2 x$ can be written as $1 - \\cos^2 x$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the identity $\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x$, but you did not substitute it into the function or simplify properly. This is where the error occurred.\nStudent：I see, but I thought using completing the square directly on $\\sin^2 x$ would work, so I didn't try substituting.\nTeacher：You assumed that completing the square on $\\sin^2 x$ alone would suffice, ignoring the interaction with $\\cos x$. This is the core error. Let me know if you'd like to explore this further.\nStudent：zzc",
