(12 points) \n(I) Discuss the monotonicity of the function $f(x)=\\frac{x-2}{x+2} e^{x}$, and prove that when $x>0$, $(x-2)e^{x}+x+2>0$.\n\n(II) Prove that when $a \\in[0,1)$, the function $g(x)=\\frac{e^{x}-a x-a}{x^{2}}(x>0)$ has a minimum value. Let the minimum value of $g(x)$ be $h(a)$, and find the range of the function $h(a)$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\n(I) To discuss the monotonicity of $f(x)$, we find its derivative, $f'(x)$. The domain of f(x) is $(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, +\\infty)$.\nUsing the quotient rule and product rule: $f'(x) = \\left(\\frac{(1)(x+2) - (x-2)(1)}{(x+2)^2}\\right)e^x + \\left(\\frac{x-2}{x+2}\\right)e^x = \\left(\\frac{4}{(x+2)^2} + \\frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{(x+2)^2}\\right)e^x$\n$f'(x) = \\frac{4 + x^2 - 4}{(x+2)^2}e^x = \\frac{x^2 e^x}{(x+2)^2}$.\nSince $x^2 \\ge 0$, $e^x > 0$, and $(x+2)^2 > 0$ for $x \\neq -2$, we have $f'(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$ in the domain. The derivative is 0 only at $x=0$. \nTherefore, $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing on $(-\\infty, -2)$ and on $(-2, +\\infty)$.\n\nTo prove the inequality for $x>0$: since $f(x)$ is increasing on $(-2, +\\infty)$, for any $x>0$, we have $f(x) > f(0)$.\n$f(0) = \\frac{0-2}{0+2}e^0 = \\frac{-2}{2}(1) = -1$.\nSo, for $x>0$, we have $\\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x > -1$. \nMultiplying by $(x+2)$ (which is positive for $x>0$):\n$(x-2)e^x > -(x+2)$\n$(x-2)e^x + x+2 > 0$. The proof is complete.\n\n(II) To find the minimum of $g(x)$, we find its derivative $g'(x)$ for $x>0$.\n$g'(x) = \\frac{(e^x-a)(x^2) - (e^x-ax-a)(2x)}{x^4} = \\frac{x(e^x-a) - 2(e^x-ax-a)}{x^3}$\n$g'(x) = \\frac{xe^x - ax - 2e^x + 2ax + 2a}{x^3} = \\frac{(x-2)e^x + ax + 2a}{x^3}$\n$g'(x) = \\frac{(x+2)(\\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x + a)}{x^3}$.\nSince $x>0$, the sign of $g'(x)$ is determined by the sign of the term $G(x) = \\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x + a = f(x)+a$.\n\nFrom part (I), $f(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x>0$. Also, $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(x) = f(0) = -1$ and $\\lim_{x\\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$. So, for $x>0$, the range of $f(x)$ is $(-1, \\infty)$.\nWe are looking for roots of $G(x)=0$, which is $f(x) = -a$. \nSince $a \\in [0, 1)$, we have $-a \\in (-1, 0]$. Since $-a$ is in the range of $f(x)$ for $x>0$, and $f(x)$ is strictly increasing, there exists a unique solution $t>0$ such that $f(t)=-a$.\n\n- When $0 < x < t$, $f(x) < f(t) = -a$, so $G(x) < 0$, which means $g'(x) < 0$. Thus, $g(x)$ is decreasing.\n- When $x > t$, $f(x) > f(t) = -a$, so $G(x) > 0$, which means $g'(x) > 0$. Thus, $g(x)$ is increasing.\nThis confirms that $g(x)$ has a unique minimum value at $x=t$. The minimum value is $h(a) = g(t) = \\frac{e^t-at-a}{t^2}$.\n\nTo find the range of $h(a)$, we express it in terms of $t$. From $f(t)=-a$, we have $a = -f(t) = -\\frac{t-2}{t+2}e^t$.\nSubstitute $a$ into the expression for $h(a)$:\n$h(a) = \\frac{e^t - (t+1)a}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t + (t+1)\\frac{t-2}{t+2}e^t}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(1 + \\frac{t^2-t-2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(\\frac{t+2+t^2-t-2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(\\frac{t^2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$.\n\nSo, the minimum value is a function of $t$: $h(a) = k(t) = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$.\nWe need to find the range of $k(t)$ for the possible values of $t$. \n$t$ is defined by $f(t) = -a$, where $a \\in [0, 1)$. This means $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$. \nWe need to find the values of $t>0$ for which $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$.\n$f(0)=-1$, and $f(2)=0$. Since $f(x)$ is increasing for $x>0$, $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$ corresponds to $t \\in (0, 2]$.\n\nNow we find the range of $k(t) = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$ for $t \\in (0, 2]$.\n$k'(t) = \\frac{e^t(t+2) - e^t(1)}{(t+2)^2} = \\frac{e^t(t+1)}{(t+2)^2}$.\nFor $t>0$, $e^t>0$, $t+1>0$, and $(t+2)^2 > 0$, so $k'(t) > 0$. \nThus, $k(t)$ is strictly increasing on $(0, 2]$.\nThe range of $k(t)$ is therefore $(k(0), k(2)]$.\n$k(0) = \\frac{e^0}{0+2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$k(2) = \\frac{e^2}{2+2} = \\frac{e^2}{4}$.\nThe range of $h(a)$ is $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{e^2}{4}]$.\n",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I directly differentiated $g(x)$ to get $g'(x) = \\frac{(e^{x}-a)x^2 - 2x(e^{x}-ax-a)}{x^4}$, but then I got stuck simplifying the result.\nTeacher：You correctly differentiated $ g(x) $, but you did not simplify the numerator properly. Let's examine the expression again. What is the simplified form of the numerator?\nStudent：The numerator is $(e^{x}-a)x^2 - 2x(e^{x}-ax-a) = (e^{x}-a)x^2 - 2x e^x + 2a x + 2a x$.\nTeacher：You have made an error in expanding the terms. Let's re-examine the expansion of $ 2x(e^x - ax - a) $. What is the correct expansion of this term?\nStudent：The correct expansion is $2x e^x - 2a x^2 - 2a x$.\nTeacher：You have now correctly expanded the term. Let's simplify the entire numerator step by step. What is the simplified form of $(e^x - a)x^2 - 2x e^x + 2a x^2 + 2a x$?\nStudent：The simplified form is $e^x x^2 - a x^2 - 2x e^x + 2a x^2 + 2a x$.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the expression. Now, let's combine like terms. What is the result after combining $ -a x^2 + 2a x^2 $?\nStudent：After combining, $-a x^2 + 2a x^2 = a x^2$.\nTeacher：You have correctly combined the terms. Now, let's combine all like terms in the numerator. What is the final simplified form of the numerator?\nStudent：The numerator is $e^{x}x^2 - 2x e^{x} + a x^2 + 2a x$.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the numerator. Now, let's factor out common terms. What is the factored form of $ e^x x^2 - 2x e^x + a x^2 + 2a x $?\nStudent：The factored form is $e^x(x^2 - 2x) + a(x^2 + 2x)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly factored the expression. Now, let's analyze the sign of the numerator for $ x > 0 $. What is the behavior of $ e^x(x^2 - 2x) + a(x^2 + 2x) $ when $ x > 0 $?\nStudent：For $x > 0$, $x^2 - 2x$ can be negative when $0 < x < 2$, and positive when $x > 2$. $x^2 + 2x$ is always positive for $x > 0$. So the sign depends on the relative sizes of $e^x(x^2 - 2x)$ and $a(x^2 + 2x)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly analyzed the behavior, but you have not yet considered how the sign of the entire expression depends on $ a \\in [0,1) $. Let's examine the critical points and how $ a $ influences the sign. What is the value of the numerator at $ x = 2 $?\nStudent：At $x=2$, the numerator is $e^2(4-4)+a(4+4) = 0 + 8a = 8a$.\nTeacher：You have correctly evaluated the numerator at $ x = 2 $. Now, let's consider the behavior of the numerator for $ x \\in (0, 2) $ and $ x > 2 $, and how $ a \\in [0,1) $ affects its sign. What is the sign of $ e^x(x^2 - 2x) + a(x^2 + 2x) $ when $ x \\in (0, 2) $?\nStudent：When $x \\in (0,2)$, $x^2-2x<0$ and $x^2+2x>0$. So $e^x(x^2-2x)$ is negative and $a(x^2+2x)$ is positive. The total sign depends on which term has a greater absolute value.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the behavior, but you have not yet analyzed how $ a \\in [0,1) $ affects the comparison between the two terms. Let's examine whether the numerator is always positive for $ x \\in (0,2) $ when $ a \\in [0,1) $.\nStudent：When $a \\in [0,1)$, $a(x^2+2x)$ is less than $x^2+2x$. But $e^x(x^2-2x)$ is negative here, so the sum might not always be positive.\nTeacher：You have correctly noted the dependency on $ a $, but you have not yet established whether the numerator is always positive for $ x \\in (0,2) $ when $ a \\in [0,1) $. Let's analyze this more carefully. Is the numerator positive for all $ x \\in (0,2) $ and $ a \\in [0,1) $?\nStudent：I'm not completely sure. For small $a$, the negative $e^x(x^2-2x)$ term might dominate for some $x$ in $(0,2)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the uncertainty, but you have not yet considered the critical role of the inequality $ a \\in [0,1) $ in ensuring the positivity of the numerator for all $ x \\in (0,2) $. Let's examine whether this inequality guarantees the positivity.\nStudent：If $a=0$, then the numerator is just $e^x(x^2-2x)$, and for $x\\in(0,2)$, this is negative. So for $a$ close to $0$, it can be negative.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the issue. The mistake is that for $ a = 0 $, the numerator is negative in $ (0,2) $, contradicting the requirement that $ g(x) $ has a minimum value when $ a \\in [0,1) $.\nStudent：Okay, thank you.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the issue. The mistake is that for $ a = 0 $, the numerator is negative in $ (0,2) $, contradicting the requirement that $ g(x) $ has a minimum value when $ a \\in [0,1) $.\nStudent：zzc",
