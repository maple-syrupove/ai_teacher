    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. 10\nTeacher：The answer you provided, A. 10, is incorrect. Let's examine your reasoning. Did you correctly identify the coordinates of points M and N?\nStudent：I found the intersection points by substituting the line equation into the parabola, which gave me coordinates for M and N.\nTeacher：Did you correctly calculate the coordinates of the focus F of the parabola $ y^2 = 4x $?\nStudent：Yes, I used F = (1, 0) as the focus of the parabola $y^2 = 4x$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the focus F as (1, 0). Did you compute the vectors $ \\overrightarrow{FM} $ and $ \\overrightarrow{FN} $ accurately?\nStudent：Yes, I calculated the vectors from F to M and F to N using their coordinates.\nTeacher：You calculated the vectors $ \\overrightarrow{FM} $ and $ \\overrightarrow{FN} $, but you did not correctly compute their dot product. Let's verify your calculation of $ \\overrightarrow{FM} \\bullet \\overrightarrow{FN} $.\nStudent：I took the lengths FM and FN, then multiplied them together: $2 \\times 5 = 10$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly computed the dot product by multiplying the lengths of vectors $ \\overrightarrow{FM} $ and $ \\overrightarrow{FN} $, rather than using the formula $ \\overrightarrow{FM} \\bullet \\overrightarrow{FN} = FM_x \\cdot FN_x + FM_y \\cdot FN_y $.\nStudent：zzc",
