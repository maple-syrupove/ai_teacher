    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I got $d = \\frac{|2-8|}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{5}}$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of the distance uses the point (2, -8), but this is not the correct coordinates of the right focus of the hyperbola. What is the standard form of a hyperbola and how do you find the foci?\nStudent：The standard form of a hyperbola is $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$. The foci are at $(h \\pm c, k)$, where $c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ for a hyperbola centered at $(h, k)$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the formula for the foci, but you did not apply it to the given hyperbola. What are the values of $a^2$, $b^2$, and the center of the hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{4} - \\frac{y^2}{5} = 1$?\nStudent：For this hyperbola, $a^2 = 4$, $b^2 = 5$, and the center is at $(0,0)$.\nTeacher：Teacher：You correctly identified $a^2$, $b^2$, and the center. What is the value of $c$ for this hyperbola, and where is the right focus located?\nStudent：$c = \\sqrt{4+5} = 3$, so the right focus is at $(3,0)$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is using the incorrect point (2, -8) in the distance formula. The correct coordinates of the right focus are (3, 0). What is the distance from the point (3, 0) to the line $x + 2y - 8 = 0$?\nStudent：The distance is $d = \\frac{|3-8|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\sqrt{5}$.\nTeacher：Your final answer is correct, but your calculation of the numerator in the distance formula is incorrect. The absolute value should be $|3 + 2(0) - 8| = | -5 | = 5$, not $|3 - 8|$. What is the correct distance?\nStudent：The correct distance is $d = \\frac{|3 + 2 \\times 0 - 8|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\sqrt{5}$.\nTeacher：Your calculation is now correct. The distance from the right focus (3, 0) to the line $x + 2y - 8 = 0$ is indeed $\\sqrt{5}$.\nStudent：Thank you! I understand how to approach this kind of problem better now.\nTeacher：You're welcome!
