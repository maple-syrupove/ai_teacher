    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：\\(\\tan\\alpha = \\tan \\left( \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4} \\right)\\)\nTeacher：Your approach assumes that $\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4} = \\frac{1}{5}$, which is incorrect. You have misinterpreted the given equation. What is the relationship between $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4})$ and $\\tan \\alpha$?\nStudent：I think $\\tan(\\alpha-\\frac{5\\pi}{4})$ and $\\tan\\alpha$ are related, but I’m not exactly sure how to express one in terms of the other.\nTeacher：You need to use the tangent subtraction formula. What is the formula for $\\tan(A - B)$?\nStudent：The formula is $\\tan(A-B) = \\frac{\\tan A - \\tan B}{1 + \\tan A \\tan B}$.\nTeacher：You have the correct formula, but you have not applied it properly. Let me rephrase the given equation: $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}$. Use the formula with $A = \\alpha$ and $B = \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$. What is $\\tan(\\frac{5\\pi}{4})$?\nStudent：\\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1\\)\nTeacher：You have correctly identified $\\tan\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1$, but you have not substituted this value into the formula. Let me restate the equation:  \n$$\n\\frac{\\tan \\alpha - 1}{1 + \\tan \\alpha \\cdot 1} = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$  \nNow solve for $\\tan \\alpha$. What is the next step?\nStudent：The next step is to set \\(\\frac{\\tan \\alpha - 1}{1 + \\tan \\alpha} = \\frac{1}{5}\\) and solve for \\(\\tan \\alpha\\).\nTeacher：You have set up the equation correctly. Now solve for $\\tan \\alpha$. What is the value of $\\tan \\alpha$?\nStudent：Multiply both sides by \\(1 + \\tan\\alpha\\):\n\n\\[\n\\tan\\alpha - 1 = \\frac{1}{5} (1 + \\tan\\alpha)\n\\]\n\nExpand:\n\n\\[\n\\tan\\alpha - 1 = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{5}\\tan\\alpha\n\\]\nTeacher：You have correctly expanded the equation, but you have not yet isolated $\\tan \\alpha$. What is the next step in solving for $\\tan \\alpha$?\nStudent：Next, I will subtract \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\tan\\alpha\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\tan\\alpha - \\frac{1}{5}\\tan\\alpha - 1 = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\nTeacher：You have correctly subtracted $\\frac{1}{5}\\tan\\alpha$ from both sides, but you have not yet moved the constant term to the right side. What is the next step?\nStudent：The next step is to add \\(1\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\tan\\alpha - \\frac{1}{5}\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{1}{5} + 1\n\\]\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the left side, but you have not yet combined like terms. What is the value of $\\tan\\alpha - \\frac{1}{5}\\tan\\alpha$?\nStudent：\\(\\tan\\alpha - \\frac{1}{5}\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{4}{5}\\tan\\alpha\\)\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the left side to $\\frac{4}{5}\\tan\\alpha$, but you have not yet solved for $\\tan\\alpha$. What is the next step?\nStudent：The next step is to divide both sides by \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{6}{5}}{\\frac{4}{5}} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\nTeacher：You have correctly solved the equation, but your final answer is incorrect. The value of $\\frac{1}{5} + 1$ is $\\frac{6}{5}$, not $\\frac{6}{5}$. What is the correct value of $\\frac{1}{5} + 1$?\nStudent：The correct value of \\(\\frac{1}{5} + 1\\) is \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $\\frac{1}{5} + 1 = \\frac{6}{5}$, but you have not performed the division correctly. What is $\\frac{\\frac{6}{5}}{\\frac{4}{5}}$?\nStudent：\\(\\frac{\\frac{6}{5}}{\\frac{4}{5}} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\nTeacher：You have correctly performed the division, but your final answer is still incorrect. What is $\\frac{6}{4}$ in simplest form?\nStudent：\\(\\frac{6}{4}\\) in simplest form is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified $\\frac{6}{4}$ to $\\frac{3}{2}$, but this is not the correct answer to the original problem. What is the mistake in your approach?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You have correctly followed the algebraic steps, but your final answer is not consistent with the original equation. Let me recheck your calculation of $\\frac{\\frac{6}{5}}{\\frac{4}{5}}$. What is the correct value of this expression?\nStudent：The correct value is \\(\\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $\\frac{\\frac{6}{5}}{\\frac{4}{5}} = \\frac{3}{2}$, but this value does not satisfy the original equation. What is the mistake in your approach?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You have correctly solved the equation algebraically, but your final answer does not satisfy the original equation. What is $\\tan\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)$ when $\\tan \\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$?\nStudent：When \\(\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}\\), then\n\n\\[\n\\tan\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2} - 1}{1 + \\frac{3}{2} \\times 1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{5}{2}} = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\nTeacher：You have correctly verified that $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$ satisfies the original equation. Therefore, your final answer is correct.\nStudent：Thank you! So the final answer is \\(\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly solved the problem and verified your answer. The final answer is $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nStudent：\\(\\tan\\alpha = \\tan \\left( \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4} \\right)\\)\nTeacher：Your approach assumes that $\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4} = \\frac{1}{5}$, which is incorrect. You have misinterpreted the given equation. What is the relationship between $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4})$ and $\\tan \\alpha$?\nStudent：I think $\\tan(\\alpha-\\frac{5\\pi}{4})$ is related to $\\tan\\alpha$, but I’m not sure how to write it directly.\nTeacher：You have not used the tangent subtraction formula correctly. What is the formula for $\\tan(A - B)$?",
