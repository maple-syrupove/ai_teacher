    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I let $AB = x$, $AC = y$, and used $AD = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$ in the Law of Cosines, but didn’t finish.\nTeacher：What relationship did you use between $AC$ and $AB$?\nStudent：I set $AC = y$ and $AB = x$, and used the condition $AC = \\sqrt{2} AB$, so $y = \\sqrt{2} x$.\nTeacher：You correctly related $AC$ and $AB$, but you did not consider the full implications of $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$ in your Law of Cosines application. Specifically, you may have misapplied the angle or its cosine value.\nStudent：I set up the Law of Cosines for triangle $ABD$: $AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BD \\cdot \\cos 135^\\circ$.\nTeacher：You have misapplied the Law of Cosines. The angle $ \\angle ADB = 135^\\circ $ is in triangle $ ABD $, but you should have used $ \\cos(180^\\circ - 135^\\circ) $ for the adjacent side relationship.\nStudent：I used $\\cos 135^\\circ$ directly in the formula, setting up $AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2 - 2\\cdot AB \\cdot BD \\cdot \\cos 135^\\circ$.\nTeacher：You have misapplied the Law of Cosines by using $ \\cos 135^\\circ $ directly in triangle $ ABD $. The angle at $ D $ is $ 135^\\circ $, but the adjacent sides are $ AD $ and $ BD $, so you should use $ \\cos(180^\\circ - 135^\\circ) = \\cos 45^\\circ $ instead.\nStudent：I see. So the correct cosine value should be $\\cos 45^\\circ$ instead of $\\cos 135^\\circ$ there.\nTeacher：You have corrected your mistake. The cosine of the angle in the Law of Cosines should indeed be $ \\cos(45^\\circ) $, not $ \\cos(135^\\circ) $, because the angle between sides $ AD $ and $ BD $ is supplementary to $ 135^\\circ $. Wait for your final response.\nStudent：Okay, so I will rewrite the Law of Cosines as $AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BD \\cdot \\cos 45^\\circ$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the cosine value to use. Now, consider the relationship between triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$. You have not yet used the given condition $AC = \\sqrt{2} AB$ effectively in your calculations.\nStudent：I only substituted $AC = \\sqrt{2}AB$ and kept $AB$ and $BD$ as unknowns in the formulas. I didn't express $BC$, $CD$, or other sides in terms of $BD$.\nTeacher：You have not fully utilized the relationship $ BC = 3BD $, which is essential for expressing other sides in terms of $ BD $. This omission prevents you from solving for $ BD $ directly.\nStudent：I see. I didn't use $BC = 3BD$, so I kept $AB$ and $BD$ as separate variables without relating everything to $BD$.\nTeacher：You have not properly expressed $ AB $ in terms of $ BD $, which is necessary to solve for $ BD $. This prevents you from completing the problem.\nStudent：That's right. I didn't express $AB$ in terms of $BD$, so I couldn't solve for $BD$.\nTeacher：You have not established a relationship between $ AB $ and $ BD $ using the given condition $ AC = \\sqrt{2} AB $, which is essential for solving the problem.\nStudent：That's correct. I only substituted $AC = \\sqrt{2}AB$, but didn't relate $AB$ to $BD$.\nTeacher：You have not utilized triangle $ ACD $ effectively to relate $ AB $ and $ BD $, which is necessary to solve for $ BD $.\nStudent：That's true. I didn't use triangle $ACD$ to relate $AB$ and $BD$ and just left them as separate variables.\nTeacher：You have not applied the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines in triangle $ ACD $ to relate $ AB $ and $ BD $, which is essential for solving the problem.\nStudent：That's correct. I didn't apply the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines in triangle $ACD$ to relate $AB$ and $BD$.\nTeacher：You have not considered the full implications of triangle $ ACD $, particularly the relationship between $ AC $, $ AD $, and $ CD $, which is essential for establishing a solvable equation involving $ BD $.\nStudent：That's correct. I only used the Law of Cosines in triangle $ABD$, and didn't set up equations involving $ACD$ or relate $CD$ to $BD$.\nTeacher：You have not expressed $ CD $ in terms of $ BD $, which is necessary to apply the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines in triangle $ ACD $. This omission prevents you from forming a solvable equation involving $ BD $.\nStudent：That's right. I didn't express $CD$ in terms of $BD$, so I couldn't make further progress in solving for $BD$.\nTeacher：You have not expressed $ CD $ in terms of $ BD $, which is necessary to apply the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines in triangle $ ACD $. This omission prevents you from forming a solvable equation involving $ BD $.\nStudent：That's right—I didn't express $CD$ in terms of $BD$, so I couldn't proceed to set up the equation.\nTeacher：You have not expressed $ CD $ in terms of $ BD $, which is essential for applying the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines in triangle $ ACD $. This omission prevents you from forming a solvable equation involving $ BD $.\nStudent：That's correct—I didn't express $CD$ in terms of $BD$, so I couldn't set up an equation to solve for $BD$.\nTeacher：You have not expressed $ CD $ in terms of $ BD $, which is essential for applying the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines in triangle $ ACD $.
