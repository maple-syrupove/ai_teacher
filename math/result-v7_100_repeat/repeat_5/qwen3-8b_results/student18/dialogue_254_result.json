    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose C. The graph of $f(x)$ is symmetric with respect to the line $x = \\pi$.\nTeacher：To assess symmetry about $ x = \\pi $, we need to check if $ f(\\pi + a) = f(\\pi - a) $. Have you tested this for specific values of $ a $?\nStudent：I checked $f(\\pi-x)$ and found it equals $f(x)$, but I didn't check $f(\\pi+a)$ and $f(\\pi-a)$ for specific $a$.\nTeacher：To confirm symmetry about $ x = \\pi $, you must verify if $ f(\\pi + a) = f(\\pi - a) $ for all $ a $. Have you tested this with specific values of $ a $?\nStudent：No, I haven't tested specific values of $a$ for $f(\\pi + a)$ and $f(\\pi - a)$.\nTeacher：Let’s test with $ a = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $. Compute $ f(\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) $ and $ f(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) $. Have you done this?\nStudent：No, I haven't computed $f(\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ and $f(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ yet.\nTeacher：Let’s compute $ f(\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = f(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) $ and $ f(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = f(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) $. Have you evaluated these?\nStudent：No, I haven't evaluated $f(\\frac{3\\pi}{2})$ and $f(\\frac{\\pi}{2})$ yet.\nTeacher：Let’s compute $ f\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)} $ and $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} $. Have you done this?\nStudent：No, I haven't done these calculations yet.\nTeacher：Let’s compute these values now. What is $ \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right) $ and $ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $?\nStudent：$\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1$, $\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right) = -1$.\nTeacher：Then $ f\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right) = -1 + \\frac{1}{-1} = -2 $, and $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{1} = 2 $. Since $ f(\\pi + a) \\neq f(\\pi - a) $, the graph is not symmetric about $ x = \\pi $. Your choice of C is incorrect.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：Your mistake was assuming symmetry about $ x = \\pi $ without verifying it with specific values. The function is not symmetric about $ x = \\pi $.\nStudent：zzc",
