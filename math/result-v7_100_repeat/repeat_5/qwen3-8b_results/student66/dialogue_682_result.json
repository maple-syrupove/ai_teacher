    "question": "3. During the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control period, a supermarket launched an online sales business and can complete the distribution of 1200 orders per day. Due to a sharp increase in the number of orders, a backlog of orders has occurred. To solve the problem, many volunteers enthusiastically signed up to participate in the distribution work. It is known that on a certain day, the supermarket has a backlog of 500 orders that have not been distributed. The probability that the new orders for the next day will exceed 1600 is 0.05. Each volunteer can complete the distribution of 50 orders per day. To ensure that the probability of completing the backlogged orders and the current day's orders on the next day is not less than 0.95, at least how many volunteers are needed?

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A. 10.\nTeacher：To ensure the probability of completing all orders is at least 0.95, you must account for both the backlog and the new orders. Did you consider the variability in the number of new orders?\nStudent：I thought most new orders would be around 1600, so I used 1600 as the average.\nTeacher：You assumed the new orders would be exactly 1600, but the problem states there is a 5% chance they will exceed 1600. Did you account for this probability in your calculation?\nStudent：I used 1600 as the number of new orders and didn't account for those rare cases exceeding 1600.\nTeacher：You need to calculate the number of volunteers required to handle both the backlog and the expected new orders, considering the probability distribution. Did you use the correct statistical method to determine the number of volunteers?\nStudent：I calculated based on the average value, not using a probability distribution method.\nTeacher：You calculated based on an average without considering the probability distribution, which is essential for determining the required number of volunteers to meet the 0.95 probability threshold.\nStudent：zzc",
