    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I answered “cannot be determined” because I couldn't get the values for $\\sin\\alpha$ and $\\cos\\alpha$ from the given information.\nTeacher：Why did you assume that $\\sin\\alpha$ and $\\cos\\alpha$ cannot be determined? Is there a trigonometric identity that relates $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha\\right)$ to $\\sin 2\\alpha$?\nStudent：I thought I needed to know both $\\sin\\alpha$ and $\\cos\\alpha$ separately to use the double angle formula, and I didn't see an identity linking the given expression directly to $\\sin2\\alpha$.\nTeacher：You assumed that $\\sin\\alpha$ and $\\cos\\alpha$ cannot be determined, but the given expression can be expanded using a trigonometric identity to find $\\sin 2\\alpha$ directly. What identity relates $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha)$ to $\\sin 2\\alpha$?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You know that $\\cos(A - B) = \\cos A \\cos B + \\sin A \\sin B$. Apply this identity to $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha\\right)$ and then relate it to $\\sin 2\\alpha$. What is the value of $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ and $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$?\nStudent：$\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly expanded $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha\\right)$ as $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(\\cos\\alpha + \\sin\\alpha) = \\frac{3}{5}$. However, you did not solve for $\\sin\\alpha + \\cos\\alpha$ or proceed to find $\\sin 2\\alpha = 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$. This is the key error.\nStudent：I thought since I didn’t have separate values for $\\sin\\alpha$ and $\\cos\\alpha$, I couldn’t find $\\sin2\\alpha$.\nTeacher：You correctly expanded the expression but failed to recognize that $\\sin 2\\alpha = 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$ can be found using $(\\sin\\alpha + \\cos\\alpha)^2 = 1 + \\sin 2\\alpha$. This is the key error.\nStudent：Oh, I see. I didn’t notice that identity, so I just stopped since I only had $\\sin\\alpha + \\cos\\alpha$, but not their separate values.\nTeacher：You correctly expanded the given expression but failed to recognize that $\\sin 2\\alpha$ can be derived from $(\\sin\\alpha + \\cos\\alpha)^2$. This is the key error.\nStudent：zzc",
