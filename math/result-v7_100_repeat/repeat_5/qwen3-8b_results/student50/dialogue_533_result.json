    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $y= \\pm x$\nTeacher：The eccentricity of a hyperbola is given by $ e = \\frac{c}{a} $, where $ c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $. You have correctly identified the asymptotes formula as $ y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a}x $, but you have not used the eccentricity to find the relationship between $ a $ and $ b $. What is the relationship between $ e $, $ a $, and $ b $?\nStudent：The relationship is $e = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly expressed the relationship between $ e $, $ a $, and $ b $. Now, using the given eccentricity $ e = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} $, what equation do you get when you substitute into $ e = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a} $?\nStudent：Substituting gives $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a}$.\nTeacher：Squaring both sides of the equation, you should get $ \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a^2} $. What is the next step in simplifying this equation?\nStudent：The next step is to multiply both sides by $a^2$ to get $5a^2/4 = a^2 + b^2$.\nTeacher：Then subtract $ a^2 $ from both sides to get $ \\frac{a^2}{4} = b^2 $. This implies $ \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{2} $, so the asymptotes are $ y = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}x $. Your answer of $ y = \\pm x $ is incorrect.\nStudent：zzc",
