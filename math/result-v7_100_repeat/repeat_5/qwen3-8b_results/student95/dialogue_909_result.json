    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. 3\nTeacher：The eccentricity of a hyperbola is always greater than 1. Since option B is 3, which is greater than 1, it is a valid possibility. However, let's verify if the calculation aligns with the given information. What is the distance between the two foci?\nStudent：The distance between the two foci is $|4 - (-4)| = 8$.\nTeacher：The distance between the foci is 8, so $2c = 8$, which means $c = 4$. What is the definition of eccentricity for a hyperbola?\nStudent：The eccentricity $e$ of a hyperbola is defined as $e = \\frac{c}{a}$, where $c$ is the distance from the center to a focus, and $a$ is the semi-transverse axis.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the formula for eccentricity. Now, let's determine the value of $a$. What is the definition of a hyperbola in terms of distances from two foci?\nStudent：For a hyperbola, the absolute value of the difference of distances from any point on the hyperbola to the two foci is constant and equal to $2a$.\nTeacher：You are correct. Let's calculate the difference in distances from the point $(-6, 4)$ to each focus. What is the distance from $(-6, 4)$ to $(0, 4)$?\nStudent：The distance from $(-6, 4)$ to $(0, 4)$ is $|-6 - 0| = 6$.\nTeacher：The distance from $(-6, 4)$ to $(0, 4)$ is indeed 6. What is the distance from $(-6, 4)$ to $(0, -4)$?\nStudent：The distance from $(-6, 4)$ to $(0, -4)$ is $\\sqrt{(-6-0)^2 + (4-(-4))^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 64} = 10$.\nTeacher：The difference in distances is $|10 - 6| = 4$, so $2a = 4$, which means $a = 2$. Since $c = 4$ and $e = \\frac{c}{a}$, the eccentricity is $\\frac{4}{2} = 2$. Your answer B. 3 is incorrect. The correct answer is C. 2.\nStudent：Understood, thank you.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated the difference in distances and found $a = 2$. However, you initially selected option B (3) as your answer, which was incorrect. The correct answer is C (2).\nStudent：Got it.\nTeacher：You initially selected option B (3) as your answer, which was incorrect.
