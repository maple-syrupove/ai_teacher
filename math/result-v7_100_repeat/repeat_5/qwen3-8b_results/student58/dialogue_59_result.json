    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：y = 3x\nTeacher：What is the derivative of $ y = 3(x^2 + x)e^x $? Have you applied the product rule correctly?\nStudent：I didn't actually calculate the derivative. I just used 3 from the equation.\nTeacher：You need to compute the derivative of the entire function, not just extract the constant factor. What is the derivative of $ y = 3(x^2 + x)e^x $?\nStudent：To find the derivative, I should use the product rule with $u = x^2 + x$ and $v = e^x$.\nTeacher：You applied the product rule, but did you correctly differentiate $ u = x^2 + x $ and $ v = e^x $? What are $ u' $ and $ v' $?\nStudent：The derivative of $u = x^2 + x$ is $u' = 2x + 1$, and $v' = e^x$.\nTeacher：You have correctly found $ u' $ and $ v' $. Now, apply the product rule: $ y' = u'v + uv' $. What is the expression for $ y' $?\nStudent：$y' = 3[(2x + 1)e^x + (x^2 + x)e^x]$\nTeacher：You have correctly applied the product rule, but you forgot to simplify the expression before evaluating it at $ x = 0 $. What is the simplified form of $ y' $?\nStudent：$y' = 3[(2x + 1 + x^2 + x)e^x] = 3(x^2 + 3x + 1)e^x$\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the expression, but you did not evaluate it at $ x = 0 $ to find the slope of the tangent line. What is the value of $ y' $ at $ x = 0 $?\nStudent：When $x=0$, $y' = 3(0^2 + 3*0 + 1)e^0 = 3*1*1 = 3$.\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated the slope of the tangent line as 3. However, you did not use this slope and the point (0, 0) to write the equation of the tangent line. What is the equation of a line with slope 3 passing through (0, 0)?\nStudent：The equation is $y = 3x$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the equation of the tangent line as $ y = 3x $. There is no error in your final answer.\nStudent：Okay.\nTeacher：You have correctly solved the problem and identified the equation of the tangent line as $ y = 3x $. There is no error in your final answer.\nStudent：Okay.\nTeacher：You have correctly solved the problem and identified the equation of the tangent line as $ y = 3x $.
