    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: k > 0.\nTeacher：The function $ f(x) = kx - \\ln x $ is monotonically increasing on $ (1, +\\infty) $ if its derivative is non-negative on that interval. Did you check the sign of the derivative?\nStudent：Yes, I calculated the derivative $f'(x) = k - \\dfrac{1}{x}$ and set it to be greater than or equal to zero.\nTeacher：To ensure monotonic increase, $ f'(x) = k - \\dfrac{1}{x} \\geq 0 $ for all $ x \\in (1, +\\infty) $. Did you analyze the behavior of $ f'(x) $ as $ x \\to 1^+ $ and $ x \\to +\\infty $?\nStudent：I only considered that $k > 0$ would make $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$, so I didn't analyze the endpoints.\nTeacher：To ensure $ f'(x) \\geq 0 $ for all $ x \\in (1, +\\infty) $, you must ensure the minimum value of $ f'(x) $ on that interval is non-negative. Did you find the minimum value of $ f'(x) $ on $ (1, +\\infty) $?\nStudent：No, I did not find the minimum value of $f'(x)$ on that interval.\nTeacher：To find the minimum value of $ f'(x) = k - \\dfrac{1}{x} $ on $ (1, +\\infty) $, you should analyze its behavior. Since $ \\dfrac{1}{x} $ decreases as $ x $ increases, the minimum value of $ f'(x) $ occurs at $ x \\to +\\infty $, where $ f'(x) \\to k $. However, the critical point is at $ x = 1 $, where $ f'(x) = k - 1 $. Therefore, to ensure $ f'(x) \\geq 0 $ for all $ x \\in (1, +\\infty) $, you must have $ k - 1 \\geq 0 $, i.e., $ k \\geq 1 $. Your mistake was not considering the value of $ f'(x) $ at $ x = 1 $.\nStudent：zzc",
