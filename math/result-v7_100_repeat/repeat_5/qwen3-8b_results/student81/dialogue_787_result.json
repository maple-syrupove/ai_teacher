    "correct_answer": "Solution: (1) We are given an arithmetic sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ with the first term $a_1 = -7$.\nWe are also given that the sum of the first 3 terms is $S_3 = -15$.\nThe formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$, where $d$ is the common difference.\nFor $n=3$, we have:\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + (3-1)d) = -15$\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + 2d) = 3(a_1+d) = -15$.\nDivide by 3: $a_1 + d = -5$.\nSubstitute the given value $a_1 = -7$:\n$-7 + d = -5$\n$d = 2$.\n\nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting $a_1=-7$ and $d=2$:\n$a_n = -7 + (n-1)2 = -7 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 9$.\n\n(2) To find the formula for $S_n$, we use the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$.\n$S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(-7 + (2n-9)) = \\frac{n}{2}(2n - 16) = n(n-8) = n^2 - 8n$.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $S_n$, we can treat $S_n = n^2 - 8n$ as a quadratic function of $n$. This is an upward-opening parabola. Its minimum value occurs at the vertex.\nThe vertex of a parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is at $x = -b/(2a)$.\nFor our function, the vertex is at $n = -(-8)/(2\\cdot1) = 4$.\nSince $n=4$ is a positive integer, the minimum value of the sequence $S_n$ occurs at $n=4$.\nLet's find the value of $S_4$:\n$S_4 = 4^2 - 8(4) = 16 - 32 = -16$.\nAlternatively, we can complete the square for $S_n$: \n$S_n = n^2 - 8n = (n^2 - 8n + 16) - 16 = (n-4)^2 - 16$.\nThe minimum value of this expression is -16, which occurs when $n=4$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $S_n$ is -16.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$a_n = -7 - 4(n-1) = -4n - 3$\nTeacher：The general term formula you provided does not match the given conditions. Let's examine the relationship between the first term and the sum of the first three terms. What is the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence?\nStudent：The formula is $S_n = \\dfrac{n}{2}(a_1+a_n)$.\nTeacher：The formula is correct, but let's verify it with the given values. What is the value of $a_3$ based on your general term formula?\nStudent：Based on my formula, $a_3 = -4 \\times 3 - 3 = -15$.\nTeacher：Using your formula, $a_3 = -15$. Now calculate $S_3$ using the sum formula. What value do you get?\nStudent：Using the formula $S_3 = \\dfrac{3}{2}(a_1 + a_3)$, I get $S_3 = \\dfrac{3}{2}(-7 + (-15)) = \\dfrac{3}{2}(-22) = -33$.\nTeacher：The calculated value of $S_3$ using your general term formula is $-33$, but it should be $-15$ based on the problem statement. This indicates an error in your general term formula. Let's examine the relationship between the first term and the common difference. What is the correct formula for the general term of an arithmetic sequence?\nStudent：The correct formula is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nTeacher：The general term formula you provided earlier does not align with the correct structure $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. Let's determine the common difference $d$ using the given information. What is the value of $S_3$ in terms of $a_1$ and $d$?\nStudent：$S_3 = \\dfrac{3}{2}\\left(2a_1 + 2d\\right) = 3a_1 + 3d$\nTeacher：The expression you provided for $S_3$ is incorrect. The correct formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence is $S_n = \\dfrac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$. Let's calculate $S_3$ using this formula and solve for $d$. What value do you get for $S_3$ in terms of $a_1$ and $d$?\nStudent：$S_3 = \\dfrac{3}{2}\\left(2a_1 + 2d\\right) = 3a_1 + 3d$\nTeacher：The expression for $S_3$ is correct, but it must equal $-15$. Given $a_1 = -7$, substitute into $S_3 = 3a_1 + 3d$ and solve for $d$. What value do you get for $d$?\nStudent：Substituting, $-15 = 3 \\times (-7) + 3d \\implies -15 = -21 + 3d \\implies 3d = 6 \\implies d = 2$.\nTeacher：The common difference $d$ is correctly calculated as $2$. However, your general term formula $a_n = -7 - 4(n-1)$ uses a common difference of $-4$, not $2$. This is the error.\nStudent：zzc",
