    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A.\nTeacher：What is the solution set for the inequality defining set A?\nStudent：The inequality is $x^2 - 2x > 0$. Solving, we get $x(x-2) > 0$, so $x < 0$ or $x > 2$. Therefore, $A = (-\\infty, 0) \\cup (2, \\infty)$.\nTeacher：What is the solution set for the inequality defining set B?\nStudent：$B = \\{x \\mid -\\sqrt{5}<x<\\sqrt{5}\\}$, so $B = \\left(-\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{5}\\right)$.\nTeacher：What is the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$?\nStudent：The intersection is $(-\\sqrt{5}, 0)\\cup(2, \\sqrt{5})$.\nTeacher：Teacher：Why do you think the intersection is not empty?\nStudent：Because both $(-\\sqrt{5}, 0)$ and $(2, \\sqrt{5})$ are non-empty intervals, so their union is not the empty set.\nTeacher：Then why did you choose A?\nStudent：I thought the sets didn't overlap, so their intersection would be empty.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that the sets $A$ and $B$ do not overlap, but in fact, they do overlap in the interval $(-\\sqrt{5}, 0)$. Therefore, $A \\cap B \\neq \\emptyset$, and option A is false.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：You initially thought $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$, but in reality, $A \\cap B = (-\\sqrt{5}, 0) \\cup (2, \\sqrt{5})$, which is not empty. Therefore, option A is false.\nStudent：zzc",
