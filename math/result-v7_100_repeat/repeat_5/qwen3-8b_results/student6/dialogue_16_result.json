    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I can't solve for $\\phi$. The two functions look too different, so I don't know how to set up an equation.\nTeacher：To solve for $\\phi$, you need to equate the transformed cosine function to the sine function and use trigonometric identities. What is the general form of a cosine function shifted to the right?\nStudent：The general form is $y = \\cos(2(x - h) + \\phi)$, where $h$ is the shift to the right.\nTeacher：You're on the right track, but you need to consider how shifting affects the phase shift. What is the relationship between the original cosine function and the shifted one?\nStudent：If the original function is $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$, then after shifting right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, it becomes $y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly transformed the cosine function, but you need to equate it to the given sine function. What is the identity that relates cosine and sine?\nStudent：I remember that $\\sin\\theta = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta)$.\nTeacher：You're correct in the identity, but you need to ensure both functions have the same argument. What is the argument of the shifted cosine function after simplification?\nStudent：After shifting, the argument becomes $2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi = 2x - \\pi + \\phi$.\nTeacher：You have simplified the argument correctly. Now, equate this to the argument of the sine function. What is the argument of the given sine function?\nStudent：The argument of the given sine function is $2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\nTeacher：You have the arguments: $2x - \\pi + \\phi$ and $2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}$. For these to be equal for all $x$, their constant terms must be equal. What is the equation you get by equating the constants?\nStudent：$-\\pi + \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$\nTeacher：You have set up the equation correctly, but you need to solve for $\\phi$ within the given interval $-\\pi \\leqslant \\phi < \\pi$. What is the value of $\\phi$ that satisfies $-\\pi + \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$?\nStudent：$\\phi = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}$\nTeacher：You have solved for $\\phi$, but the value $\\frac{4\\pi}{3}$ does not lie within the interval $-\\pi \\leqslant \\phi < \\pi$. What is the correct value of $\\phi$ that satisfies the equation within the given interval?\nStudent：The correct value should be $\\phi = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} - 2\\pi = -\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, which is in the interval.\nTeacher：You have correctly adjusted $\\phi$ to fit within the interval, but you should verify that the adjusted value satisfies the original equation. Is $-\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ the correct value of $\\phi$?\nStudent：Yes, $-\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ satisfies $-\\pi + \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, since $-\\pi + (-\\frac{2\\pi}{3}) = -\\frac{5\\pi}{3}$, which does not equal $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\nTeacher：You have made a mistake in verifying the solution. The equation $-\\pi + \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ must be satisfied, not $-\\pi + \\phi = -\\frac{5\\pi}{3}$. What is the correct value of $\\phi$ that satisfies the equation?\nStudent：$\\phi = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}$\nTeacher：You have incorrectly adjusted $\\phi$ to fit within the interval. The value $\\frac{4\\pi}{3}$ is not in the interval $-\\pi \\leqslant \\phi < \\pi$. What is the correct value of $\\phi$ that satisfies $-\\pi + \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ within the given interval?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You have not correctly adjusted $\\phi$ to fit within the interval. The correct value of $\\phi$ is $-\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\nStudent：zzc",
