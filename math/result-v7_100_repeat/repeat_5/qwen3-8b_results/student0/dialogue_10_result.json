    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the maximum and minimum of $f(x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$ by differentiating directly, but the calculations were too complicated and I couldn't get a final answer for $M + m$.\nTeacher：What approach did you take when differentiating the function? Did you simplify the expression before taking the derivative?\nStudent：I directly applied the quotient rule to the original function without trying to simplify the expression first.\nTeacher：You did not simplify the expression before taking the derivative, which likely made the differentiation process more complex and error-prone. Could you explain how you applied the quotient rule?\nStudent：I set $u = (x+1)^2 + \\sin x$ and $v = x^2 + 1$, so I computed $f'(x) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$. I found $u' = 2(x+1) + \\cos x$, and $v' = 2x$.\nTeacher：Your derivative calculation is correct, but you did not simplify the expression for $f'(x)$ before solving $f'(x) = 0$, which likely made finding critical points more difficult. Did you attempt to simplify $f'(x)$ before solving?\nStudent：No, I tried to solve $f'(x) = 0$ directly using the unsimplified derivative, which made it difficult to find the critical points.\nTeacher：You did not simplify the derivative expression before solving $f'(x) = 0$, which made it infeasible to find critical points analytically. This likely led to an incorrect or incomplete solution for $M + m$.\nStudent：zzc",
