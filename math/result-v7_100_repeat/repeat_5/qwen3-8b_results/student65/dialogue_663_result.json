    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose C.\nTeacher：What is the formula for sample standard deviation? How does it depend on the distribution of probabilities?\nStudent：The formula for sample standard deviation is $\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{4} p_{i} (x_i - \\mu)^2}$, where $\\mu$ is the mean of the data. The more spread out the probabilities are towards the ends, the larger the standard deviation.\nTeacher：The formula is correct. However, you mentioned \"more spread out towards the ends,\" but in this case, the values are symmetric around the mean. Which scenario has the greatest deviation from the mean?\nStudent：Among these, the scenario where more probability is assigned to the extreme values 1 and 4 should have a greater deviation from the mean.\nTeacher：You are correct that extreme values increase deviation. However, in scenario C, the probabilities are more evenly distributed around the mean, reducing the overall variance. Which scenario assigns the most probability to the extreme values 1 and 4?\nStudent：That would be scenario B, where $p_{1}=p_{4}=0.4$.\nTeacher：You are correct that scenario B assigns the most probability to the extreme values. However, the standard deviation depends on both the spread and the mean. Did you calculate the mean for each scenario?\nStudent：No, I only calculated the mean for options A and C.\nTeacher：You didn't consider that the mean varies across scenarios, which affects the squared deviations. Did you account for this in your analysis?\nStudent：No, I only focused on options A and C and didn't compare the means for all scenarios.\nTeacher：You failed to consider that the mean varies across scenarios, which directly affects the squared deviations from the mean. This oversight led you to incorrectly select option C.\nStudent：zzc",
