    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I expanded $(1+ax)$ to get $1 + ax$, then expanded $(1+x)^5$. For $x^2$, I just took $a$ times the coefficient of $x$ in $(1+x)^5$ plus the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(1+x)^5$. So I got $a = 0$.\nTeacher：The error is in how you combined the coefficients. You incorrectly assumed that the coefficient of $x^2$ in the product comes only from multiplying $ax$ with the coefficient of $x$ in $(1+x)^5$, but you neglected to account for the contribution from the constant term of $(1+ax)$ multiplied by the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(1+x)^5$.\nStudent：zzc",
