    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Insufficient information.\nTeacher：The problem provides enough information. What assumption did you make that led you to conclude there is insufficient data?\nStudent：I assumed that since I couldn't find a value for $|\\vec{b}|$ directly, there must be missing information.\nTeacher：What formula relates the magnitude of a vector difference to the magnitudes and angle between vectors?\nStudent：I know that $|\\vec{a}-\\vec{b}| = \\sqrt{|\\vec{a}|^2 + |\\vec{b}|^2 - 2|\\vec{a}||\\vec{b}| \\cos\\theta}$.\nTeacher：You applied the formula correctly for $|\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|$, but the problem involves $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|$, not $|\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|$. Did you adjust the formula accordingly for the scalar multiple of $\\vec{a}$?\nStudent：I tried to expand $|2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b}|$ as $\\sqrt{|2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2}$, but got stuck.\nTeacher：You expanded the expression incorrectly. The correct expansion of $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2$ involves squaring the dot product term properly. Did you use the distributive property of the dot product?\nStudent：I used the distributive property to expand $(2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b})\\cdot(2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b})$ as $4|\\vec{a}|^2-4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}+|\\vec{b}|^2$.\nTeacher：You correctly expanded the expression, but you did not substitute the known values properly. Did you use the given angle and magnitudes to compute the dot product $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$?\nStudent：I know that $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = |\\vec{a}||\\vec{b}|\\cos 45^\\circ$, but I didn't substitute it in.\nTeacher：You have not substituted the expression for $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$ into the expanded equation. This is where the error lies.\nStudent：I see. I didn’t substitute $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$ into the equation after expanding $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2$.\nTeacher：You failed to substitute the expression for $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$ into the equation, which is essential for solving for $|\\vec{b}|$.\nStudent：zzc",
