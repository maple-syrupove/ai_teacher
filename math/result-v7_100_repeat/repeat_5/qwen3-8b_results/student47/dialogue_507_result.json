    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. [0,2]\nTeacher：Your answer assumes that all elements of set $A$ are integers, which is incorrect. What is the nature of the elements in set $A$?\nStudent：The elements in set $A$ are all real numbers $x$ such that $|x| \\leq 2$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the elements of set $A$, but you failed to recognize that set $B$ contains only integers. Therefore, the intersection $A \\cap B$ must consist of integers that also belong to $A$. What is the mistake in your reasoning?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You need to identify the integers in set $B$ that also satisfy the condition of set $A$. What is the range of integers in set $B$?\nStudent：The integers in set $B$ are all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\\sqrt{x} \\leq 4$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the integers in set $B$, but you did not consider the condition $|x| \\leq 2$ from set $A$. What is the range of integers in set $B$ that also satisfy $|x| \\leq 2$?\nStudent：The integers in set $B$ that also satisfy $|x| \\leq 2$ are $0, 1, 2$.\nTeacher：D. $\\{0,1,2\\}$ is the correct answer, but you incorrectly selected B. [0,2], which includes non-integer values. Your mistake was assuming the intersection contains real numbers rather than only integers.\nStudent：zzc",
