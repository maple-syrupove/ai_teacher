    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$m = \\frac{1}{2}$\nTeacher：The asymptotes of the hyperbola are $y = \\pm \\frac{x}{m}$. Did you correctly identify the equations of the asymptotes?\nStudent：Yes, the equations of the asymptotes are $y = \\pm \\frac{x}{m}$.\nTeacher：The next step is to find the equations of the asymptotes and then determine their distance from the center of the circle. Did you calculate the center and radius of the circle correctly?\nStudent：I took the center as (0,0) and radius as $\\sqrt{3}$.\nTeacher：The center of the circle is (0, 2), not (0, 0). Did you correctly complete the square to find the center and radius?\nStudent：No, I didn't complete the square. I just used the equation as given.\nTeacher：You did not complete the square for the circle equation, which is essential to find its center and radius. Did you account for the shift in the y-coordinate when completing the square?\nStudent：No, I didn't account for the shift in the y-coordinate.\nTeacher：You failed to complete the square for the circle equation, leading to an incorrect center and radius.
