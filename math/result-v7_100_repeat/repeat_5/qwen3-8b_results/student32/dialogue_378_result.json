    "question": "17. To improve service quality, a shopping mall randomly surveyed 50 male customers and 50 female customers. Each customer gave a rating of 'satisfied' or 'dissatisfied' with the mall's service, resulting in the contingency table below:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\n\\hline & Satisfied & Dissatisfied \\\\\n\\hline Male Customer & 40 & 10 \\\\\n\\hline Female Customer & 30 & 20 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(1) Estimate the probability that a male customer is satisfied and the probability that a female customer is satisfied with the mall's service, respectively.\n\n(2) Can we be $95 \\%$ confident that there is a difference in the evaluation of the mall's service between male and female customers?\n\nAppendix: $K^{2}=\\frac{n(a d-b c)^{2}}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)}$. \n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline$P\\left(K^{2} \\geq k\\right)$ & 0.050 & 0.010 & 0.001 \\\\\n\\hline$k$ & 3.841 & 6.635 & 10.828 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n",
    "correct_answer": "【Detailed Explanation】(1) From the table provided, out of 50 surveyed male customers, 40 were satisfied.\nTherefore, the estimated probability that a male customer is satisfied is $P_{1}=\\frac{40}{50}=\\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$.\n\nOut of 50 surveyed female customers, 30 were satisfied.\nTherefore, the estimated probability that a female customer is satisfied is $P_{2}=\\frac{30}{50}=\\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$.\n\n(2) To determine if there is a statistically significant difference, we perform a chi-squared test for independence. The values for the formula are: $a=40, b=10, c=30, d=20$. The total sample size is $n = 50 + 50 = 100$. The row and column totals are: \n$a+b = 50$ (Total Males)\n$c+d = 50$ (Total Females)\n$a+c = 70$ (Total Satisfied)\n$b+d = 30$ (Total Dissatisfied)\n\nNow, we calculate the $K^2$ statistic:\n$K^{2}=\\frac{n(ad-bc)^{2}}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)} = \\frac{100(40 \\times 20 - 10 \\times 30)^{2}}{(50)(50)(70)(30)}$\n$K^{2}=\\frac{100(800 - 300)^{2}}{2500 \\times 2100} = \\frac{100(500)^{2}}{5250000}$\n$K^{2}=\\frac{100 \\times 250000}{5250000} = \\frac{25000000}{5250000} = \\frac{2500}{525} = \\frac{100}{21}$\n$K^{2} \\approx 4.762$\n\nTo have 95% confidence, we compare the calculated $K^2$ value with the critical value at a significance level of $\\alpha = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$. From the provided table, the critical value $k$ for $P(K^2 \\ge k) = 0.050$ is $3.841$.\n\nSince our calculated value $K^2 \\approx 4.762$ is greater than the critical value $3.841$, we reject the null hypothesis of independence.\nTherefore, we can be 95% confident that there is a difference in the evaluation of the mall's service between male and female customers.",
