    "question": "8. (5 points) The Chinese mathematician Chen Jingrun achieved world-leading results in the study of Goldbach's Conjecture. Goldbach's Conjecture states that 'every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes', for example, $30=7+23$. If two distinct numbers are randomly selected from the prime numbers not exceeding 30, what is the probability that their sum is 30?
