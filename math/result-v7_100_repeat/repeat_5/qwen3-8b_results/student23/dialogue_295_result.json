    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\nTeacher：To find the minimum and maximum values of $ f(x) = \\cos x + (x+1)\\sin x + 1 $ on $[0, 2\\pi]$, you must evaluate the function at critical points and endpoints. Did you compute the derivative $ f'(x) $ and solve for critical points?\nStudent：No, I didn't compute the derivative.\nTeacher：To accurately determine the extrema, you must first find the critical points by computing $ f'(x) $. Did you differentiate the function correctly?\nStudent：No, I did not differentiate the function.\nTeacher：You need to compute the derivative of $ f(x) $ to find critical points. What is $ f'(x) $?\nStudent：$f'(x) = -\\sin x + (x+1)\\cos x + \\sin x$\nTeacher：You simplified $ f'(x) $ incorrectly. The derivative of $ (x+1)\\sin x $ is not $ (x+1)\\cos x $; you must apply the product rule. What is the correct derivative of $ (x+1)\\sin x $?\nStudent：The correct derivative of $(x+1)\\sin x$ is $\\sin x + (x+1)\\cos x$.\nTeacher：You correctly applied the product rule for $ (x+1)\\sin x $, but you still made an error in simplifying $ f'(x) $. Let's examine your final expression for $ f'(x) $. What is the simplified form of $ f'(x) $?\nStudent：The simplified form is $f'(x) = -\\sin x + \\sin x + (x+1)\\cos x$. So, $f'(x) = (x+1)\\cos x$.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified $ f'(x) $ to $ (x+1)\\cos x $. However, you did not solve $ f'(x) = 0 $ to find critical points. Did you set $ (x+1)\\cos x = 0 $ and solve for $ x $ in $[0, 2\\pi]$?\nStudent：No, I didn't set $(x+1)\\cos x = 0$ and solve for $x$.\nTeacher：You missed solving $ (x+1)\\cos x = 0 $ to find critical points. Did you consider the solutions to $ \\cos x = 0 $ in the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider the solutions to $\\cos x = 0$ in the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$.\nTeacher：You did not evaluate the function $ f(x) $ at the critical points and endpoints to determine its minimum and maximum values. Did you compute $ f(x) $ at $ x = 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}, 2\\pi $ and the critical points?\nStudent：No, I didn't compute $f(x)$ at those points or the critical points.\nTeacher：You did not evaluate the function $ f(x) $ at the critical points and endpoints to determine its minimum and maximum values. Did you compute $ f(x) $ at $ x = 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}, 2\\pi $ and the critical points?\nStudent：No, I did not compute $f(x)$ at those points or the critical points.\nTeacher：You failed to evaluate the function $ f(x) $ at critical points and endpoints to determine its minimum and maximum values. This omission led to an incorrect choice of answer.\nStudent：I didn't realize I needed to check those values.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed the extrema were based on trigonometric bounds without evaluating the function at critical points and endpoints. This led to an incorrect choice of answer.\nStudent：zzc",
