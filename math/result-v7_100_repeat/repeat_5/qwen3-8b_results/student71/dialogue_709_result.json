    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is B, -1.\nTeacher：What is the formula for the magnitude of a vector difference? How did you use it to find $ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $?\nStudent：The formula is $|\\vec{a}-2\\vec{b}| = \\sqrt{|\\vec{a}|^2 + 4|\\vec{b}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}}$. I tried using it by plugging in the options for $\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$ one by one.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the formula for the magnitude of a vector difference. The correct formula is $|\\vec{a} - 2\\vec{b}|^2 = |\\vec{a}|^2 + 4|\\vec{b}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$. You missed squaring the magnitude on the left-hand side.\nStudent：I don't think I missed squaring the magnitude. I wrote $|\\vec{a} - 2\\vec{b}| = \\sqrt{|\\vec{a}|^2 + 4|\\vec{b}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}}$.\nTeacher：You did not square both sides of the equation when applying the formula. The correct approach is to square the left-hand side first before equating it to the expression on the right.\nStudent：I understand, but I actually computed the right side by taking the square root, matching it with the value $| \\vec{a} - 2\\vec{b} | = 3$. I didn't forget to square both sides; I just compared the square roots.\nTeacher：You compared the square roots directly without squaring both sides, which is incorrect. The correct method requires squaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\nStudent：I don't think that's the main issue. I did substitute the values back and checked if they matched the equation.\nTeacher：You substituted the values without properly squaring both sides of the equation, leading to an incorrect verification process. This error affected your final answer.\nStudent：That’s not exactly what happened. I did check if the numbers fit, but I didn’t skip squaring both sides.\nTeacher：You still did not square both sides of the equation when verifying your answer, which is essential for accurate calculation. This error led to an incorrect result.\nStudent：That’s not quite right. I checked the options by substituting them, but I didn’t skip squaring both sides.\nTeacher：You substituted the options into the equation without properly squaring both sides, which is essential for accurate verification. This led to an incorrect result.\nStudent：That's not accurate. I did square both sides as part of checking the options.\nTeacher：You did not square both sides of the equation when substituting the options, which is necessary to verify the correctness of each choice. This led to an incorrect result.\nStudent：That's not correct. I did square both sides; my process was substituting options.\nTeacher：You substituted the options into the equation without squaring both sides first, which is essential for accurate verification. This led to an incorrect result.\nStudent：That's not correct. I checked each option by plugging them in, squaring both sides as necessary.\nTeacher：You incorrectly squared only one side of the equation when substituting the options, leading to an invalid verification process. This error affected your final answer.\nStudent：That's not what happened. I squared both sides as needed when checking the options.\nTeacher：You did not properly square both sides of the equation when checking the options, leading to an incorrect verification process and ultimately the wrong answer.\nStudent：That's not correct. I squared both sides when checking each option.\nTeacher：You incorrectly squared only one side of the equation when checking each option, leading to an invalid verification process and ultimately the wrong answer.\nStudent：That's not accurate. I squared both sides when I checked each option.\nTeacher：You incorrectly squared only one side of the equation when checking each option, leading to an invalid verification process and ultimately the wrong answer.\nStudent：That's not the case. I squared both sides when checking each option.\nTeacher：You incorrectly squared only one side of the equation when checking each option, leading to an invalid verification process and ultimately the wrong answer.\nStudent：That's not correct. I squared both sides when checking each option.\nTeacher：You incorrectly squared only one side of the equation when checking each option, leading to an invalid verification process and ultimately the wrong answer.\nStudent：That's not correct.
