    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：2\nTeacher：What is the relationship between $ |z_1 + z_2| $, $ |z_1 - z_2| $, and $ |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 $?\nStudent：$|z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 2(|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2)$.\nTeacher：You correctly recalled the identity. Let's compute $ |z_1 + z_2|^2 $ and $ |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 $. What is $ |z_1 + z_2|^2 $?\nStudent：$|z_1 + z_2|^2 = |\\sqrt{3} + i|^2 = (\\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2 = 3 + 1 = 4$.\nTeacher：You calculated $ |z_1 + z_2|^2 = 4 $. What is $ |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 $?\nStudent：$|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8$.\nTeacher：You have $ |z_1 + z_2|^2 = 4 $ and $ |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 8 $. Using the identity $ |z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 2(|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2) $, what is $ |z_1 - z_2|^2 $?\nStudent：$|z_1 - z_2|^2 = 2 \\times 8 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12$\nTeacher：Then $ |z_1 - z_2| = \\sqrt{12} $.
