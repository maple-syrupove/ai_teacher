    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose $\\overrightarrow{E B} = \\overrightarrow{A B}$.\nTeacher：Your answer assumes that point E is the same as point B, which is incorrect. Can you explain how you arrived at this conclusion?\nStudent：I saw that $E$ and $B$ were both related to $A$, so I thought $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$. I didn't break it down further.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that the vector from E to B is the same as the vector from A to B, without considering the position of E relative to A and D. Can you explain how you determined the relationship between E and B?\nStudent：I just noticed that E is on AD, but I didn't analyze how far E is from A towards D. I didn't consider its effect fully.\nTeacher：You failed to account for the fact that E is the midpoint of AD, which affects its position relative to B. Can you explain how you determined the vector from E to B?\nStudent：I just thought of drawing vectors directly from E to B like from A to B, without splitting E's position further.\nTeacher：You treated E as a point directly connected to B without considering the vector relationships through A and D. Can you explain how you accounted for the position of E in your calculation?\nStudent：I didn't really account for the exact position of E between A and D. I skipped breaking E down with vectors.\nTeacher：You failed to express the position of E in terms of vectors from A and D, which is essential for determining $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. Can you explain how you represented E's location using vector relationships?\nStudent：I didn't actually represent E's location using vectors from A and D; I just skipped to using E without expressing it.\nTeacher：You did not express the position of E in terms of vectors from A and D, which is essential for determining $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. Can you explain how you represented E's location using vector relationships?\nStudent：I didn't represent E's location using vector relationships; I just used point E as given without breaking it into vectors.\nTeacher：You failed to express the position of E in terms of vectors from A and D, which is essential for determining $\\overrightarrow{EB}$.\nStudent：zzc",
