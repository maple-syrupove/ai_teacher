    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C, $c<a<b$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes $c < a$, but this is incorrect. What is the relationship between $a = \\log_2 0.2$ and $c = 0.2^{0.3}$?\nStudent：$a = \\log_2 0.2$ is a logarithm, and $c = 0.2^{0.3}$ is an exponential expression. I didn't explicitly compare them properly.\nTeacher：What is the approximate value of $a = \\log_2 0.2$?\nStudent：$a = \\log_2 0.2 \\approx -2.32$\nTeacher：What is the approximate value of $ c = 0.2^{0.3} $?\nStudent：$c = 0.2^{0.3} \\approx 0.617$\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $ a \\approx -2.32 $ and $ c \\approx 0.617 $. Therefore, $ a < c $. Your initial choice of C ($c < a < b$) is incorrect because it reverses the relationship between $a$ and $c$. What is the approximate value of $b = 2^{0.2}$?\nStudent：$b = 2^{0.2} \\approx 1.149$\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $ a \\approx -2.32 $, $ c \\approx 0.617 $, and $ b \\approx 1.149 $. Therefore, the correct order is $ a < c < b $, which corresponds to option B. Your initial choice of C was incorrect because it reversed the relationship between $a$ and $c$.\nStudent：zzc",
