    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I got z = 2 as the minimum value.\nTeacher：What method did you use to find the minimum value of $ z = x - 5y $? Did you consider all the vertices of the feasible region?\nStudent：I tried plugging in some points from the boundaries of the constraints, but I didn't consider all the vertices.\nTeacher：You only evaluated some points on the boundaries, but to find the minimum value of $ z = x - 5y $, you must evaluate it at all the vertices of the feasible region.\nStudent：Okay, I understand. Should I try to find the equations of intersection to get the actual vertices?\nTeacher：Yes, you should find the exact vertices by solving the system of equations formed by the intersections of the constraint lines. Once you have all the vertices, evaluate $ z = x - 5y $ at each to determine the minimum value.
