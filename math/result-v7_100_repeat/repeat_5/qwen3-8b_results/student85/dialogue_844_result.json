    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C.\nTeacher：The complement of $A \\cup B$ in $U$ includes all integers not in $A$ or $B$. What is the pattern of numbers not in $A$ or $B$?\nStudent：I think it's the numbers that don't fit $x=3k+1$ or $x=3k+2$, so maybe numbers like $x=3k$?\nTeacher：You're on the right track, but let's clarify: What is the general form of integers not in $A$ or $B$?\nStudent：The general form would be $x=3k$, where $k$ is an integer.\nTeacher：You are correct that the complement of $A \\cup B$ in $U$ consists of numbers of the form $x = 3k$. However, let's verify: What is the relationship between $x = 3k$ and the forms $x = 3k+1$ and $x = 3k+2$?\nStudent：The numbers of the form $x = 3k$ are exactly those that are neither $x = 3k+1$ nor $x = 3k+2$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that the complement of $A \\cup B$ in $U$ is $\\{x \\mid x = 3k, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.\nStudent：Okay, I see.\nTeacher：You have now correctly identified the complement of $A \\cup B$ in $U$ as $\\{x \\mid x = 3k, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$, which corresponds to option **A**. Therefore, your initial choice of **C** was incorrect.
