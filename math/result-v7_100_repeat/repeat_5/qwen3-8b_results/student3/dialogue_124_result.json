    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D.\nTeacher：What is the definition of an odd function?\nStudent：The definition of an odd function is that for all $x$ in the domain, $f(-x) = -f(x)$.\nTeacher：What is the definition of an even function?\nStudent：The definition of an even function is that for all $x$ in the domain, $g(-x) = g(x)$.\nTeacher：What happens to $f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)$ if $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even?\nStudent：If $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, then $f(-x) \\cdot g(-x) = (-f(x)) \\cdot g(x) = -f(x) \\cdot g(x)$.\nTeacher：What does this imply about the function $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $?\nStudent：It means $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = | -f(x) \\cdot g(x) | = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：The absolute value makes the result non-negative, so $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is equal to $ |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| $. This implies that $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is an even function, not an odd function. Therefore, your choice of D is incorrect.\nStudent：zzc",
