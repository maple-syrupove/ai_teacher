    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is 2.\nTeacher：The distance from B to F is not equal to the distance from A to F. Let's verify the coordinates of F and calculate |BF|.\nStudent：The focus F of the parabola \\( y^2 = 4x \\) is at (1, 0). The distance from B(3,0) to F(1,0) is \\( |3-1| = 2 \\).\nTeacher：You correctly identified the coordinates of F and calculated |BF|. Now, let's verify if there are multiple points A on the parabola that satisfy |AF| = |BF|. Is there a unique point A satisfying this condition?\nStudent：If I let A = (x, y) on the parabola, I first tried y = 0, giving A(1,0). So, I only got one point.\nTeacher：You assumed only y = 0 satisfies the condition, but there may be other points A on the parabola where |AF| = |BF|. Let's explore this further.\nStudent：Should I try substituting other values for y, for example y ≠ 0, and solve for possible x on the parabola?\nTeacher：Yes, let's consider the general case where A = (x, y) lies on the parabola $ y^2 = 4x $. Use the distance formula to express $ |AF| $ and set it equal to $ |BF| = 2 $. Solve for possible coordinates of A.\nStudent：Let A = (x, y) on the parabola, so y² = 4x. Using the distance formula, |AF| = √[(x-1)² + y²]. Set this equal to 2, so √[(x-1)² + y²] = 2.\nTeacher：Squaring both sides gives (x-1)² + y² = 4. Substitute y² = 4x into the equation. Did you do this correctly?\nStudent：Yes. Substituting y² = 4x gives (x-1)² + 4x = 4.\nTeacher：Expanding (x-1)² gives x² - 2x + 1. So the equation becomes x² - 2x + 1 + 4x = 4. Simplify to x² + 2x + 1 = 4. This simplifies further to x² + 2x - 3 = 0. Did you solve this quadratic correctly?\nStudent：Yes. Solving x² + 2x - 3 = 0, I get x = 1 or x = -3.\nTeacher：You found x = 1 or x = -3, but x = -3 is not valid since the parabola $ y^2 = 4x $ only includes x ≥ 0. Thus, x = 1 is the only valid solution. Did you check if this leads to a unique point A?\nStudent：Yes, for x = 1, from y² = 4x we get y² = 4, so y = 2 or y = -2. But I previously only considered y = 0.\nTeacher：You found two valid points A: (1, 2) and (1, -2). However, you only calculated the distance from B(3,0) to A(1,0), not to (1, 2) or (1, -2). Let's calculate |AB| for these points.\nStudent：For A(1,2), |AB| = √[(3-1)² + (0-2)²] = √[4 + 4] = √8 = 2√2. Same for A(1,-2): |AB| = 2√2.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the coordinates of A as (1, 2) and (1, -2), and calculated |AB| as $ 2\\sqrt{2} $. However, you initially assumed only y = 0 satisfies the condition, which led to an incomplete analysis. Your final answer is correct.\nStudent：Okay.\nTeacher：Your initial assumption that only y = 0 satisfies the condition was incorrect, leading to an incomplete analysis. However, your final answer is correct.\nStudent：zzc",
