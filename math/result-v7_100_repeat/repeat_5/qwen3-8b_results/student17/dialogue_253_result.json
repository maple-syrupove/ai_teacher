    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $\\sqrt{5}$\nTeacher：Using the Law of Cosines, you found AB. Then, using the Law of Sines, you calculated $\\sin B$ and $\\cos B$, but you incorrectly assumed $\\tan B = \\frac{\\sin B}{\\cos B}$. Did you use the correct values for $\\sin B$ and $\\cos B$?\nStudent：I think I found $\\sin B$ using the side lengths, but I'm not sure if the values were correct.\nTeacher：You incorrectly calculated $\\sin B$ by assuming the opposite side was 4, but in reality, the side opposite angle $B$ is $AC = 4$, and you should have used the Law of Sines with the correct sides. Did you use the correct ratio for $\\sin B$?\nStudent：I thought I used the right ratio, but maybe I mixed up which side to match with angle $B$.\nTeacher：You mixed up the sides when applying the Law of Sines. The side opposite angle $B$ is $AC = 4$, but you incorrectly associated it with another side. Did you use the correct ratio for $\\sin B$?\nStudent：I think I paired $AC = 4$ with angle $B$, but maybe I matched it incorrectly.\nTeacher：You incorrectly matched the side $AC = 4$ with angle $B$, but in reality, angle $B$ is opposite side $AC$, so you should have used the Law of Sines correctly with this pairing. Did you use the correct value for $\\sin C$?\nStudent：Yes, I used $\\sin C$ as part of my calculation.\nTeacher：You correctly used $\\sin C$, but your mistake lies in the calculation of $\\sin B$ and $\\cos B$ after applying the Law of Sines. You did not properly use the Pythagorean identity to find $\\cos B$ from $\\sin B$. Did you use the correct identity to find $\\cos B$?\nStudent：I used the Pythagorean identity, but I might have plugged in the wrong value for $\\sin B$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly calculated $\\sin B$ by using the wrong ratio in the Law of Sines. You should have used $\\frac{\\sin B}{AC} = \\frac{\\sin C}{AB}$, but you mixed up the sides. Did you use the correct side lengths in your ratio?\nStudent：I think I mixed up the side lengths and might have used the wrong ones in the ratio.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the Law of Sines by using the wrong side lengths in the ratio. Specifically, you should have used $\\frac{\\sin B}{AC} = \\frac{\\sin C}{AB}$, but you mixed up the sides. Did you use the correct side lengths in your ratio?\nStudent：I think I might have swapped the side lengths and did not use the correct ratio.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the Law of Sines by swapping the side lengths in the ratio. Specifically, you should have used $\\frac{\\sin B}{AC} = \\frac{\\sin C}{AB}$, but you mixed up the sides. Did you use the correct side lengths in your ratio?\nStudent：I think I used the side opposite angle $B$, but I may have confused their placement in the ratio.\nTeacher：You incorrectly placed the side lengths in the Law of Sines ratio. Specifically, you should have used $\\frac{\\sin B}{AC} = \\frac{\\sin C}{AB}$, but you mixed up the sides. Did you use the correct side lengths in your ratio?\nStudent：I think I made a mistake with the side lengths and confused their proper placement in the ratio.\nTeacher：You incorrectly placed the side lengths in the Law of Sines ratio. Specifically, you should have used $\\frac{\\sin B}{AC} = \\frac{\\sin C}{AB}$, but you mixed up the sides.

Specifically, you should have used $\\frac{\\sin B}{AC} = \\frac{\\sin C}{AB}$, but you mixed up the sides. Did you use the correct side lengths in your ratio?\nStudent：I think I mixed up the side lengths again and used the wrong ones in my ratio.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the Law of Sines by swapping the side lengths in the ratio.
