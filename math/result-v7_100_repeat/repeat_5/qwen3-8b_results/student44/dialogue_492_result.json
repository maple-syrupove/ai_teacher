Given that $F$ is the right focus of the hyperbola $C: \\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a>0, b>0)$, $A$ is the right vertex of $C$, and $B$ is a point on $C$ such that $B F$ is perpendicular to the $x$-axis. If the slope of $A B$ is 3, then the eccentricity of $C$ is\n",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to let $A(a,0)$ and $B(a,3a)$, then used the slope $3$ and substituted into the hyperbola, but couldn’t solve for eccentricity.\nTeacher：Your assumption that $B(a, 3a)$ is incorrect. The coordinates of $B$ are not determined solely by the slope of $AB$.\nStudent：But if the slope is 3, then shouldn’t $B$ be at $(a,3a)$ to make $AB$ have that slope?\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that the slope of $ AB $ directly determines the coordinates of $ B $, without considering the constraint that $ B $ lies on the hyperbola and that $ BF $ is perpendicular to the $ x $-axis. This oversight leads to an incorrect coordinate for $ B $.\nStudent：zzc",
