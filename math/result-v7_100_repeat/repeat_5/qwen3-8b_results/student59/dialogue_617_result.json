    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：D.\nTeacher：What is the relationship between vectors $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AB}, \\overrightarrow{AC}$? How did you determine the coefficients in your answer?\nStudent：I thought that since E is a midpoint, I could write EB using the midpoint formula. I used the formula $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})$.\nTeacher：You assumed that E is the midpoint of BC, but E is actually the midpoint of AD. How does this affect the vector relationship?\nStudent：Oh, I see. Since E is the midpoint of AD, I should reconsider how to express the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ because the position of E is different.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that E is the midpoint of AD, but you still applied the midpoint formula as if E were the midpoint of BC. How does the position of D (as the midpoint of BC) influence the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$?\nStudent：The position of D being the midpoint of BC means I need to first find the coordinates of D in terms of A, B, and C, then use those to find E and finally express EB.\nTeacher：You need to express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$, not directly apply the midpoint formula. How do you express $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$?\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{AD}$ can be written as the vector from A to the midpoint D of BC, so I should express D first as the midpoint of B and C.\nTeacher：You're on the right track, but you haven't yet expressed $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$. How would you write $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ using vector addition?\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{AD} = \\overrightarrow{AB} + \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AC} - \\overrightarrow{AB})$.\nTeacher：You have expressed $\\overrightarrow{AD}$, but you have not yet used the fact that E is the midpoint of AD. How would you express $\\overrightarrow{AE}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AD}$?\nStudent：Since E is the midpoint of AD, $\\overrightarrow{AE} = \\frac{1}{2} \\overrightarrow{AD}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly expressed $\\overrightarrow{AE}$, but you have not yet used it to find $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. How would you express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AE}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AB}$?\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{EA} + \\overrightarrow{AB}$, where $\\overrightarrow{EA} = -\\overrightarrow{AE}$. So $\\overrightarrow{EB} = -\\overrightarrow{AE} + \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：You have expressed $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AE}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, but you have not yet substituted the expression for $\\overrightarrow{AE}$. What is the final expression for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$?\nStudent：The final expression for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ is $-\\overrightarrow{AE} + \\overrightarrow{AB} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\overrightarrow{AD} + \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：You have expressed $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AD}$, but you have not yet substituted the expression for $\\overrightarrow{AD}$. What is the final expression for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$?\nStudent：If I substitute $\\overrightarrow{AD} = \\overrightarrow{AB} + \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AC} - \\overrightarrow{AB})$, then I get: \n\n$\\overrightarrow{EB} = -\\frac{1}{2}[\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AC} - \\overrightarrow{AB})] + \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Simplify the expression you have written for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. What do you get?\nStudent：After simplifying, I get:\n\n$\\overrightarrow{EB} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{4}\\overrightarrow{AC} + \\frac{1}{4}\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\n\nCombining terms, \n\n$\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\frac{3}{4}\\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{4}\\overrightarrow{AC}$.\nTeacher：You have arrived at the correct expression for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$, which matches option A. However, your initial answer was D, indicating a mistake in your original selection. Your final expression is correct.\nStudent：Thank you, I understand now. I chose D at first, but now see option A is correct.\nTeacher：You initially selected D, but your final expression for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ is $\\frac{3}{4} \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AC}$, which corresponds to option A. Your mistake was in the initial selection.\nStudent：zzc",
