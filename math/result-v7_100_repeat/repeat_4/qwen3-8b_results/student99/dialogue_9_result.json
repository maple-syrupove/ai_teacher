    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Insufficient information.\nTeacher：The problem provides enough information. What assumptions did you make that led you to conclude there is insufficient data?\nStudent：I assumed that knowing only the angle and the magnitudes of $\\vec{a}$ and $2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}$ was not enough to find $|\\vec{b}|$ directly.\nTeacher：You assumed that the relationship between the vectors cannot be expressed algebraically. Can you explain how you derived your conclusion?\nStudent：I wrote down $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = 10$, so $|2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2 = 10$, but I couldn't eliminate all the variables.\nTeacher：You incorrectly expanded the square of the vector magnitude. The correct expansion is $ |2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = |2\\vec{a}|^2 + |\\vec{b}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} $.\nStudent：That's actually the formula I wrote down: $|2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2 = 10$.\nTeacher：You correctly expanded the expression, but you failed to compute $ |2\\vec{a}|^2 $ properly. Since $ |\\vec{a}| = 1 $, $ |2\\vec{a}|^2 = 4 $.\nStudent：Yes, I had $|2\\vec{a}|^2 = 4$ since $|2\\vec{a}| = 2|\\vec{a}| = 2$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $ |2\\vec{a}|^2 = 4 $, but you did not substitute the value of $ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $, which is $ |\\vec{a}||\\vec{b}|\\cos(45^\\circ) $. This is the missing step in your calculation.\nStudent：Oh, I see. I didn't substitute $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = |\\vec{a}|\\,|\\vec{b}|\\cos(45^\\circ)$. I left it as $\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$.\nTeacher：You failed to substitute the dot product with its expression in terms of magnitudes and the angle between the vectors. This omission prevented you from solving for $|\\vec{b}|$.\nStudent：zzc",
