    "correct_answer": "Solution: (1) When $a=4$, the function is $f(x)=(x+1)\\ln x - 4(x-1)$.\nThe point of tangency is at $x=1$. Let's find $f(1)$.\n$f(1) = (1+1)\\ln(1) - 4(1-1) = 2(0) - 4(0) = 0$. So the point is $(1,0)$.\n\nNext, find the derivative of the function to get the slope of the tangent line.\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}((x+1)\\ln x - 4(x-1)) = (1)(\\ln x) + (x+1)(\\frac{1}{x}) - 4 = \\ln x + 1 + \\frac{1}{x} - 4 = \\ln x + \\frac{1}{x} - 3$.\n(Note: Original solution has a calculation error in the derivative, $4$ instead of $3$. Let's follow the original's derivative: $f'(x) = \\ln x + 1 + \\frac{1}{x} - a$. At $a=4$, $f'(x) = \\ln x + 1 + \\frac{1}{x} - 4$.)\nNow, evaluate the slope at $x=1$: \n$f'(1) = \\ln(1) + 1 + \\frac{1}{1} - 4 = 0 + 1 + 1 - 4 = -2$. The slope is $k=-2$.\n\nThe equation of the tangent line at $(1,0)$ with slope -2 is:\n$y - 0 = -2(x - 1)$\n$y = -2x + 2$.\n\n(II) We are given the condition $f(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in (1, +\\infty)$.\n$(x+1)\\ln x - a(x-1) > 0$.\nSince $x>1$, the term $(x-1)$ is positive, so we can divide by it without changing the inequality direction.\n$a < \\frac{(x+1)\\ln x}{x-1}$ for all $x \\in (1, +\\infty)$.\nThis means that $a$ must be less than or equal to the minimum value (or infimum) of the function $h(x) = \\frac{(x+1)\\ln x}{x-1}$ on the interval $(1, +\\infty)$.\n\nLet's find the behavior of $h(x)$. We can find its limit as $x \\to 1^+$. This is an indeterminate form $\\frac{0}{0}$, so we can use L'Hopital's Rule.\n$\\lim_{x\\to 1^+} h(x) = \\lim_{x\\to 1^+} \\frac{\\frac{d}{dx}((x+1)\\ln x)}{\\frac{d}{dx}(x-1)} = \\lim_{x\\to 1^+} \\frac{(1)\\ln x + (x+1)\\frac{1}{x}}{1} = \\frac{\\ln(1) + (1+1)\\frac{1}{1}}{1} = \\frac{0+2}{1} = 2$.\nSo, the function $h(x)$ approaches 2 as $x$ approaches 1 from the right.\n\nNow let's find the derivative of $h(x)$ to see if it's increasing or decreasing.\n$h'(x) = \\frac{(\\ln x + \\frac{x+1}{x})(x-1) - (x+1)\\ln x(1)}{(x-1)^2} = \\frac{(x\\ln x + x+1)(x-1) - x(x+1)\\ln x}{x(x-1)^2}$.\n$h'(x) = \\frac{x^2\\ln x + x^2 + x - x\\ln x - x - 1 - x^2\\ln x - x\\ln x}{x(x-1)^2} = \\frac{x^2 - 1 - 2x\\ln x}{x(x-1)^2}$.\nLet $k(x) = x^2 - 1 - 2x\\ln x$. We check the sign of $k(x)$ for $x>1$. \n$k'(x) = 2x - (2\\ln x + 2x(\\frac{1}{x})) = 2x - 2\\ln x - 2 = 2(x - 1 - \\ln x)$.\nLet $m(x) = x - 1 - \\ln x$. $m'(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{x-1}{x}$. For $x>1$, $m'(x)>0$, so $m(x)$ is increasing. \nSince $m(1) = 1-1-\\ln 1 = 0$, we have $m(x) > 0$ for $x>1$. This means $k'(x)>0$, so $k(x)$ is increasing. \nSince $k(1) = 1-1-0=0$, we have $k(x)>0$ for $x>1$. This means $h'(x)>0$ for $x>1$.\nSo, the function $h(x)$ is monotonically increasing on $(1, +\\infty)$.\n\nThe infimum (greatest lower bound) of $h(x)$ on this interval is its limit as $x \\to 1^+$, which is 2.\nSince $h(x)$ is always greater than 2, the condition $a < h(x)$ for all $x>1$ means that $a$ must be less than or equal to the infimum.\nTherefore, $a \\le 2$.\nThe range of values for $a$ is $(-\\infty, 2]$.",
