    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Cannot be determined.\nTeacher：The problem provides enough information to determine a unique value for $ t $. What assumption are you making that leads you to conclude it cannot be determined?\nStudent：I thought that since $t$ appears in both $\\vec{c}$ and when expanding $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{c}$, it can't be solved without more information.\nTeacher：You are assuming that the equation will not yield a unique solution for $ t $. Let's examine the relationship between $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 0 $ and the expression for $ \\vec{c} $. What does this dot product imply about the components of $ \\vec{c} $?\nStudent：It means that $\\vec{c}$ is perpendicular to $\\vec{b}$, so their dot product equals zero.\nTeacher：You are correct that $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 0 $ implies $ \\vec{c} $ is perpendicular to $ \\vec{b} $. However, you have not yet used the specific form of $ \\vec{c} $ or the angle between $ \\vec{a} $ and $ \\vec{b} $. Let's compute $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} $ explicitly. What is $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} $ in terms of $ t $?\nStudent：$\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = t(\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a}) + (1-t)(\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{b})$\nTeacher：You have correctly expanded the dot product. Now, recall that $ \\vec{a} $ and $ \\vec{b} $ are unit vectors with an angle of $ 60^\\circ $ between them. What is $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} $?\nStudent：$\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} = |\\vec{b}| \\cdot |\\vec{a}| \\cdot \\cos 60^\\circ = 1 \\times 1 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} = \\frac{1}{2} $. What is $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} $?\nStudent：$\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 1$\nTeacher：You have correctly identified $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 1 $. Now substitute these values into the expression for $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} $ and solve for $ t $. What is the resulting equation?\nStudent：$\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = t \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (1-t) \\cdot 1 = 0$\nTeacher：You have correctly substituted the values. Now solve the equation $ \\frac{1}{2}t + (1 - t) = 0 $. What is the value of $ t $?\nStudent：$\\frac{1}{2}t + 1 - t = 0$ ⟹ $1 - \\frac{1}{2}t = 0 \\Rightarrow t = 2$\nTeacher：You have correctly solved the equation and found $ t = 2 $. However, the mistake lies in the assumption that $ t $ must be a scalar multiple within the range of typical linear combinations. The problem does not restrict $ t $ to any such range, so $ t = 2 $ is a valid solution.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：You have correctly solved the equation and found $ t = 2 $.
