    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. [0,2]\nTeacher：Your answer assumes all real numbers between 0 and 2 are in set B, but set B only contains integers. What is the correct definition of set B?\nStudent：Set B is the set of all integers x such that $\\sqrt{x} \\leq 4$.\nTeacher：Your answer includes real numbers, but set B only contains integers. What is the intersection of set A (real numbers) and set B (integers)?\nStudent：The intersection would be the set of all integers from A that are also in B.\nTeacher：The intersection of a set of real numbers and a set of integers is the set of integers that are also in the real number set. Which integers in A satisfy the condition for B?\nStudent：The integers in A are $-2, -1, 0, 1, 2$. Among these, those that also satisfy $\\sqrt{x} \\leq 4$ are $0,1,2$.\nTeacher：The integers in A that satisfy $\\sqrt{x} \\leq 4$ are $0, 1, 2$. However, set B is defined as integers $x$ such that $\\sqrt{x} \\leq 4$, which implies $x \\leq 16$. All of $0, 1, 2$ satisfy this condition. Therefore, the correct answer is D. $\\{0,1,2\\}$.\nStudent：Okay, I understand now.\nTeacher：Your final answer is correct. The intersection $A \\cap B = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, so the correct choice is D.\nStudent：Thank you! I'll be more careful with set definitions next time.\nTeacher：You're welcome! I'm glad you've understood the importance of carefully analyzing set definitions. Keep up the good work!\nStudent：B.
