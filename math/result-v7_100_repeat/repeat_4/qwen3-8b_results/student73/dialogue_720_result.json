    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. $b>a>c$\nTeacher：To determine the correct order, let's analyze the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. First, consider the approximate values of the trigonometric functions involved. Next, compare these values to determine their relative sizes. What is the approximate value of $\\cos \\frac{1}{4}$?\nStudent：I think $\\cos \\frac{1}{4}$ is about 0.968.\nTeacher：Your approximation for $\\cos \\frac{1}{4}$ is reasonable. Now, what is the approximate value of $\\sin \\frac{1}{4}$?\nStudent：I think $\\sin \\frac{1}{4}$ is about 0.247.\nTeacher：Then, $c = 4 \\sin \\frac{1}{4} \\approx 4 \\times 0.247 = 0.988$. Now, compare the approximate values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. What is the correct order?\nStudent：$a < b < c$\nTeacher：Then, $a = \\frac{31}{32} \\approx 0.9689$. You stated $a < b < c$, but this contradicts the approximate values $a \\approx 0.9689$, $b \\approx 0.968$, and $c \\approx 0.988$. What is the correct order based on these values?\nStudent：Based on these values, the correct order is $b < a < c$.\nTeacher：Then, the correct order is $b < a < c$, which corresponds to option D: $a > c > b$. Your initial answer was incorrect.\nStudent：Okay, I see.\nTeacher：Your initial answer was incorrect because you misordered $b$, $a$, and $c$. The correct order is $b < a < c$, which corresponds to option D.\nStudent：I understand.\nTeacher：Your initial answer was incorrect because you misordered $b$, $a$, and $c$. The correct order is $b < a < c$, which corresponds to option D.\nStudent：zzc",
