    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{5}$.\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\tan \\theta$?\nStudent：Let me calculate that. Since $\\tan(\\theta+\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{2}$, I can use the tangent addition formula. \n\n$\\tan\\left(\\theta+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\tan\\theta+1}{1-\\tan\\theta}$\n\nSet this equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$ and solve for $\\tan\\theta$:\n\n$\\frac{\\tan\\theta+1}{1-\\tan\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$2(\\tan\\theta+1) = 1-\\tan\\theta$\n\n$2\\tan\\theta+2=1-\\tan\\theta$\n\n$3\\tan\\theta= -1$\n\n$\\tan\\theta = -\\frac{1}{3}$\nTeacher：What is the sign of $\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta$ in the second quadrant?\nStudent：In the second quadrant, $\\sin \\theta$ is positive and $\\cos \\theta$ is negative.\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta$ using $\\tan \\theta = -\\frac{1}{3}$ and the quadrant information?\nStudent：Given $\\tan\\theta=-\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\theta$ in the second quadrant, we can write $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{3}$ and $\\cos\\theta = -\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{3}$. So $\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta = 0$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of $\\sin\\theta$ and $\\cos\\theta$ is incorrect. You have not properly normalized the values based on the hypotenuse.\nStudent：Okay, I understand. Should I use the Pythagorean identity with $\\tan\\theta = -\\frac{1}{3}$ to solve for $\\sin\\theta$ and $\\cos\\theta$?\nTeacher：Yes, but you must consider the correct signs and normalize the values properly. What is the hypotenuse in this case?\nStudent：If $\\tan\\theta = -\\frac{1}{3}$, the opposite side is $1$, adjacent is $-3$, so hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{1^2 + (-3)^2} = \\sqrt{10}$.\nTeacher：You have not considered the correct quadrant when assigning signs to the sides of the triangle. In the second quadrant, the opposite side (sin) is positive, and the adjacent side (cos) is negative. However, you should not assign a negative sign to the adjacent side directly; instead, you should use the signs based on the quadrant when determining the final values of $\\sin\\theta$ and $\\cos\\theta$.\nStudent：Oh, I see. Since in the second quadrant, $\\sin\\theta$ is positive and $\\cos\\theta$ is negative, then $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}$ and $\\cos\\theta = -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nTeacher：Then $\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} - \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{10}} = -\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{10}} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{5}$. Your initial answer was incorrect in sign.\nStudent：Okay, I see my answer should have been $-\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{5}$.\nTeacher：Your initial answer was incorrect in sign. The correct value is $-\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{5}$.\nStudent：zzc",
