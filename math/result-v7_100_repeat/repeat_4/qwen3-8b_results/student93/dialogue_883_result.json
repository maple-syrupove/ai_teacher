But what if {S_n/n} is arithmetic? Does that necessarily mean {a_n} is arithmetic?\nStudent：I didn't try verifying that direction. I just substituted the formulas forward, but didn't check if it works backwards.\nTeacher：You only checked that A implies B, but didn't confirm whether B implies A. This means you didn't fully evaluate the necessary and sufficient conditions.\nStudent：zzc",
