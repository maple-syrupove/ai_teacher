    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：y = 3x\nTeacher：What is the derivative of $ y = 3(x^2 + x)e^x $? Have you applied the product rule correctly?\nStudent：I didn't calculate the derivative; I just used the 3 from the coefficient.\nTeacher：You assumed the derivative of $ y = 3(x^2 + x)e^x $ is simply $ 3x $, but this ignores the product rule and the chain rule. What is the correct derivative?\nStudent：I think the correct derivative should be found using the product rule:  \n$\\dfrac{dy}{dx} = 3\\left[ (2x+1)e^x + (x^2 + x)e^x \\right]$.\nTeacher：You applied the product rule correctly, but you did not simplify the expression. What is the simplified form of the derivative?\nStudent：The simplified form is:  \n$\\dfrac{dy}{dx} = 3e^x [ (2x + 1) + (x^2 + x) ] = 3e^x(x^2 + 3x + 1)$.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified the derivative. What is the value of the derivative at $ x = 0 $?\nStudent：At $x = 0$, $\\dfrac{dy}{dx} = 3e^0(0^2 + 3 \\times 0 + 1) = 3 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 3$.\nTeacher：You correctly found the derivative at $ x = 0 $ to be 3. What is the equation of the tangent line at the point $ (0, 0) $?\nStudent：The equation is $y = 3(x - 0)$, which simplifies to $y = 3x$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated the slope of the tangent line as 3, but you did not use the point-slope form properly. The equation of the tangent line at $ (0, 0) $ should be $ y - 0 = 3(x - 0) $, which simplifies to $ y = 3x $. Your final answer is correct.\nStudent：y = 3x\nTeacher：Your final answer is correct. The equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point $(0,0)$ is indeed $y = 3x$.\nStudent：y = 3x\nTeacher：Your final answer is correct. The equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point $(0,0)$ is indeed $y = 3x$.\nStudent：y = 3x\nTeacher：Your final answer is correct.
