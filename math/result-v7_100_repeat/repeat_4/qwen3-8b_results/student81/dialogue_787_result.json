    "correct_answer": "Solution: (1) We are given an arithmetic sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ with the first term $a_1 = -7$.\nWe are also given that the sum of the first 3 terms is $S_3 = -15$.\nThe formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$, where $d$ is the common difference.\nFor $n=3$, we have:\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + (3-1)d) = -15$\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + 2d) = 3(a_1+d) = -15$.\nDivide by 3: $a_1 + d = -5$.\nSubstitute the given value $a_1 = -7$:\n$-7 + d = -5$\n$d = 2$.\n\nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting $a_1=-7$ and $d=2$:\n$a_n = -7 + (n-1)2 = -7 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 9$.\n\n(2) To find the formula for $S_n$, we use the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$.\n$S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(-7 + (2n-9)) = \\frac{n}{2}(2n - 16) = n(n-8) = n^2 - 8n$.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $S_n$, we can treat $S_n = n^2 - 8n$ as a quadratic function of $n$. This is an upward-opening parabola. Its minimum value occurs at the vertex.\nThe vertex of a parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is at $x = -b/(2a)$.\nFor our function, the vertex is at $n = -(-8)/(2\\cdot1) = 4$.\nSince $n=4$ is a positive integer, the minimum value of the sequence $S_n$ occurs at $n=4$.\nLet's find the value of $S_4$:\n$S_4 = 4^2 - 8(4) = 16 - 32 = -16$.\nAlternatively, we can complete the square for $S_n$: \n$S_n = n^2 - 8n = (n^2 - 8n + 16) - 16 = (n-4)^2 - 16$.\nThe minimum value of this expression is -16, which occurs when $n=4$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $S_n$ is -16.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：The general term formula I got is $a_n = -4n - 3$.\nTeacher：What is the value of $a_1$ according to your formula?\nStudent：According to my formula, $a_1 = -4 \\times 1 - 3 = -7$.\nTeacher：That is correct. What is the value of $a_2$ according to your formula?\nStudent：According to my formula, $a_2 = -4 \\times 2 - 3 = -8 - 3 = -11$.\nTeacher：What is the value of $S_3$ according to your formula for $a_n$?\nStudent：Using my formula, $a_1 = -7$, $a_2 = -11$, $a_3 = -15$. So, $S_3 = -7 + (-11) + (-15) = -33$.\nTeacher：The value of $S_3$ according to your calculation is $-33$, but it should be $-15$. This indicates an error in your general term formula.\nStudent：Okay.\nTeacher：You have incorrectly calculated the common difference. Let's determine it using the given information. What is the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence?\nStudent：The formula is $S_n = \\dfrac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$.\nTeacher：You have used the wrong formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence. The correct formula is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$. Let's find the common difference $d$ using the given $S_3 = -15$. What is the value of $S_3$ in terms of $d$?\nStudent：$S_3 = \\dfrac{3}{2} [2a_1 + 2d] = \\dfrac{3}{2} (2 \\times -7 + 2d) = \\dfrac{3}{2}(-14 + 2d) = 3(-7 + d) = -21 + 3d$.\nTeacher：You have correctly expressed $S_3$ in terms of $d$. Now, set this equal to the given value of $-15$ and solve for $d$. What is the equation you get?\nStudent：$-21 + 3d = -15$\nTeacher：Solving $-21 + 3d = -15$ gives $3d = 6$, so $d = 2$. You have incorrectly calculated the common difference. Let's determine the correct general term formula. What is the general term formula for an arithmetic sequence?\nStudent：The general term formula is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nTeacher：You have not applied the correct common difference in your general term formula. Let's calculate the correct general term using $a_1 = -7$ and $d = 2$. What is the correct general term formula?\nStudent：Using $a_1 = -7$ and $d = 2$, the general term formula is $a_n = -7 + (n-1)\\times 2 = -7 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 9$.\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated the general term formula. However, your initial formula $a_n = -4n - 3$ was incorrect. The error was in the calculation of the common difference.\nStudent：Okay.\nTeacher：You incorrectly calculated the common difference $d$. The correct value of $d$ is $2$, not $-4$. This led to an incorrect general term formula.\nStudent：Okay.\nTeacher：You incorrectly calculated the common difference $d$.
