    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your answer assumes that $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ is equal to $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, which implies that points $E$ and $A$ are the same, or that $B$ lies on the line extending from $A$ through $E$. This is incorrect because $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$, and $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$.
