    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：我的答案是2。\nTeacher：Your answer suggests you believe the distance between A and B is 2. Let me ask: Did you use the coordinates of point A to calculate the distance AB?\nStudent：是的，我用点A的坐标和点B的坐标来计算了AB的距离。\nTeacher：Your answer suggests you calculated the distance AB directly using coordinates of A and B. Let me ask: Did you determine the coordinates of point A first?\nStudent：是的，我先通过条件确定了点A的坐标，然后带入计算了AB的距离。\nTeacher：Your answer suggests you found the coordinates of point A first. Let me ask: Did you correctly determine the coordinates of point A based on the condition $|AF| = |BF|$?\nStudent：我用$|AF|=|BF|$这个条件，根据A在抛物线上，列了方程，得到了A的坐标。\nTeacher：Your answer suggests you solved for point A using the condition $|AF| = |BF|$. Let me ask: Did you correctly identify the coordinates of the focus $F$ of the parabola $y^2 = 4x$?\nStudent：是的，我知道抛物线$y^2=4x$的焦点是$F(1,0)$。\nTeacher：You correctly identified the focus $ F(1,0) $. Let me ask: Did you correctly calculate the distance $ |AF| $ using the coordinates of point A and the focus $ F $?\nStudent：是的，我用了点A和焦点F的坐标来计算$|AF|$的距离。\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $ |AF| $. Let me ask: Did you correctly calculate $ |BF| $ using the coordinates of point B and the focus $ F $?\nStudent：是的，我用了点B和焦点F的坐标来算$|BF|$。\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $ |BF| $. Let me ask: Did you set $ |AF| = |BF| $ and solve for the coordinates of point A?\nStudent：是的，我设$|AF|=|BF|$，然后解方程得出了点A的坐标。\nTeacher：You set $ |AF| = |BF| $ and solved for the coordinates of point A. Let me ask: Did you correctly solve the equation $ |AF| = |BF| $ to find the coordinates of point A?\nStudent：我解这个方程时，令A的y坐标为0，然后解出了A(1,0)这个点。\nTeacher：You assumed that the y-coordinate of point A is 0, which is not necessarily true. This led to an incorrect solution for the coordinates of point A.\nStudent：zzc",
