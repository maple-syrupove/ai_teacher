    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I couldn't solve for $\\phi$. I thought $\\phi$ cannot be solved because the functions have different forms.\nTeacher：To solve for $\\phi$, you need to equate the phase shifts of the two functions after the shift. What is the phase shift of the original function $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$?\nStudent：The phase shift of $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ is $-\\frac{\\phi}{2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the phase shift of the original function. Now, what is the phase shift of the shifted function $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ after it is shifted to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units?\nStudent：After shifting to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units, the phase shift becomes $-\\frac{\\phi}{2}+\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of the new phase shift is incorrect. What is the general formula for shifting a function horizontally?\nStudent：The general formula is $f(x-a)$ shifts the graph of $f(x)$ to the right by $a$ units.\nTeacher：You are correct about the general formula, but you applied it incorrectly. How does shifting a function horizontally affect its phase shift?\nStudent：Shifting a function horizontally by $a$ units to the right replaces $x$ by $x-a$ in the function's expression, affecting the phase term.\nTeacher：You are correct in understanding the effect of horizontal shifting. Let's now focus on the phase shift of the shifted function. What is the new function expression after shifting $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units?\nStudent：After shifting to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the new function becomes $y = \\cos\\left(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi\\right) = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly derived the new function expression. Now, compare this with the given function $y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$. What is the relationship between cosine and sine functions in terms of phase shift?\nStudent：I'm not sure. I didn't think of their relationship when trying to solve the problem.\nTeacher：You are correct to recognize the relationship between sine and cosine. Recall that $\\cos(\\theta) = \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. How does this identity help you equate the two functions?\nStudent：I didn't think of using that identity, so I didn't try to convert the cosine function to a sine function for comparison.\nTeacher：You need to express the cosine function in terms of sine to compare the phase shifts. What is the phase shift of the function $y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$ using the identity $\\cos(\\theta) = \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$?\nStudent：The phase shift of $y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$ expressed as sine would be $y = \\sin\\left(2x - \\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly converted the cosine function to a sine function. Now, equate the phase shifts of the two sine functions. What is the phase shift of $y = \\sin\\left(2x - \\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$?\nStudent：The phase shift is $-\\frac{\\phi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：You have not correctly calculated the phase shift of the converted sine function. What is the general form of a sine function and how does it relate to its phase shift?\nStudent：The general form is $y = \\sin(a x + b)$. The phase shift is $-\\frac{b}{a}$.\nTeacher：You are correct about the general form and phase shift. Now, apply this to $y = \\sin\\left(2x - \\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. What is the value of $b$ in this expression?\nStudent：In $y = \\sin(2x - \\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, $b = -\\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified $b$. Now, using the phase shift formula $-\\frac{b}{a}$, what is the phase shift of this sine function?\nStudent：The phase shift is $-\\frac{-\\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}}{2}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated the phase shift of the converted sine function. Now, equate this to the phase shift of $y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$. What is the phase shift of the given sine function?\nStudent：The phase shift of $y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ is $-\\frac{\\pi}{6}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the phase shifts. Now, equate the two phase shifts and solve for $\\phi$. What is the resulting equation?\nStudent：$-\\frac{-\\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}}{2} = -\\frac{\\pi}{6}$\nTeacher：You have set up the equation correctly. Now solve for $\\phi$.\nStudent：$-\\frac{-\\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}}{2} = -\\frac{\\pi}{6}$\n\nMultiply both sides by $-2$:\n$-\\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$\n\nCombine like terms:\n$\\phi - \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$\n\n$\\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$\n\n$\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$\nTeacher：Your final answer $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ is outside the given range $-\\pi \\leqslant \\phi < \\pi$. You have not considered the periodicity of the trigonometric functions when solving for $\\phi$.\nStudent：I thought that since $-\\pi \\leqslant \\phi < \\pi$, $\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ was within the interval, so I left it as it is.\nTeacher：Your answer $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ is within the given interval $-\\pi \\leqslant \\phi < \\pi$, so your final answer is correct.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher.\nTeacher：You have correctly solved for $\\phi$ and verified that it lies within the given interval. Your final answer is correct.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher.\nTeacher：You have correctly solved for $\\phi$ and verified that it lies within the given interval. Your final answer is correct.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher.\nTeacher：You have correctly solved for $\\phi$ and verified that it lies within the given interval. Your final answer is correct.",
