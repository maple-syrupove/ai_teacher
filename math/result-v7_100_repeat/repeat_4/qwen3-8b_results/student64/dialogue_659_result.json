    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose B.\nTeacher：Since you chose B, let's examine the values. What is the relationship between the arguments of the function in option B?\nStudent：I only tried to directly compare the numbers: $\\log_8 \\frac{1}{4}$, $2^{-2/3}$, and $2^{-3/2}$, but I wasn’t sure about their exact order.\nTeacher：To determine the correct order, let's convert all values to a common base or decimal form. What is the approximate value of $\\log_8 \\frac{1}{4}$?\nStudent：$\\log_8 \\frac{1}{4} = \\log_8 (4^{-1}) = -\\log_8 4$. Since $8 = 2^3$ and $4 = 2^2$, $\\log_8 4 = \\frac{2}{3}$, so $\\log_8 \\frac{1}{4} = -\\frac{2}{3}$.\nTeacher：What is the approximate value of $2^{-2/3}$ and $2^{-3/2}$?\nStudent：$2^{-2/3} = (2^{2/3})^{-1} = 1 / 2^{2/3} \\approx 1 / 1.59 \\approx 0.63$.  \n$2^{-3/2} = 1 / 2^{3/2} = 1 / (\\sqrt{2^3}) = 1 / \\sqrt{8} \\approx 1 / 2.83 \\approx 0.35$.\nTeacher：Since $f(x)$ is even, $f(-x) = f(x)$. Therefore, we need to compare the absolute values of the arguments. What is the absolute value of $\\log_8 \\frac{1}{4}$?\nStudent：The absolute value of $\\log_8 \\frac{1}{4}$ is $\\left|-\\frac{2}{3}\\right| = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nTeacher：Since $f(x)$ is monotonically decreasing on $(0, +\\infty)$, the larger the absolute value of the argument, the smaller the function value. What is the order of the absolute values of the arguments in option B?\nStudent：The order of the absolute values is: $\\frac{2}{3}$ (for $\\log_8\\frac{1}{4}$), $0.63$ ($2^{-2/3}$), $0.35$ ($2^{-3/2}$). So, $\\frac{2}{3} > 0.63 > 0.35$.\nTeacher：Since the function is monotonically decreasing on $(0, +\\infty)$, the larger the absolute value, the smaller the function value. Therefore, the correct order of function values should be $f\\left(\\log_8 \\frac{1}{4}\\right) < f\\left(2^{-\\frac{2}{3}}\\right) < f\\left(2^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)$. Your choice of B is incorrect.\nStudent：Okay.\nTeacher：The error is in the order of the function values. The correct order should be $f\\left(2^{-\\frac{2}{3}}\\right) > f\\left(2^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\right) > f\\left(\\log_8 \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$.\nStudent：zzc",
