    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $\\sqrt{5}$\nTeacher：Using the Law of Cosines, you found AB. Then, using the Law of Sines, you calculated angle B. However, you did not account for the correct ratio when calculating tan B. Let me clarify: Did you use the correct sides in your calculation of tan B?\nStudent：I used the sides that I found earlier with the Law of Cosines when trying to calculate tan B.\nTeacher：You used the Law of Cosines to find AB, but when calculating tan B, you did not correctly identify the opposite and adjacent sides relative to angle B. Let me ask: Did you use the correct triangle sides for tan B?\nStudent：I used the side opposite angle B and an adjacent side, but I might not have matched them correctly to angle B.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the opposite side, but you did not use the correct adjacent side for angle B. Let me ask: Did you use the side adjacent to angle B, which is AC, in your calculation of tan B?\nStudent：I used AC, which is 4, in my calculation for tan B.\nTeacher：You used AC as the adjacent side, but in reality, the side adjacent to angle B is AB, not AC. Let me ask: Did you confuse the sides adjacent to angle B and angle C?\nStudent：No, I didn't confuse the sides adjacent to angle B and angle C.\nTeacher：You did not correctly identify the side adjacent to angle B. The side adjacent to angle B is AC, not AB. Let me ask: Did you use the correct side adjacent to angle B in your calculation of tan B?\nStudent：I thought I used the correct side, which was AC, as the adjacent side to angle B.\nTeacher：You incorrectly identified the side adjacent to angle B as AC, when in fact, the side adjacent to angle B is BC. Let me ask: Did you confuse the sides adjacent to angle B and angle C?\nStudent：No, I don't think I confused the sides adjacent to angle B and angle C.\nTeacher：You incorrectly identified the side adjacent to angle B as AC, when in fact, the side adjacent to angle B is BC.

Let me ask: Did you use BC as the adjacent side in your calculation of tan B?\nStudent：No, I did not use BC as the adjacent side in my calculation.\nTeacher：You have consistently misidentified the side adjacent to angle B as AC instead of BC. This fundamental error in identifying the sides relative to angle B led to an incorrect calculation of tan B.\nStudent：I don't think that's the specific error I made.\nTeacher：You have consistently misidentified the side adjacent to angle B as AC instead of BC.
