    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I picked the point $x=2, y=0$ and calculated $z=2-5\\times0=2$. So, I think the minimum value is 2.\nTeacher：Your mistake is assuming that the point $x=2, y=0$ satisfies all the constraints. You need to verify if this point meets all three inequalities before using it to calculate $z$.\nStudent：I thought since $x=2, y=0$ is on the boundary of one of the constraints, it would work, so I just quickly checked that one.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that being on the boundary of one constraint guarantees satisfaction of all constraints. You must verify the point against all three inequalities.\nStudent：I see. I didn't check all three inequalities; I only considered the one boundary and overlooked the others.\nTeacher：Your error is not checking whether the point $x=2, y=0$ satisfies all three constraints. You only verified one constraint and assumed the others were satisfied by default. To find the minimum value of $z=x-5y$, you must ensure the point lies within the feasible region defined by all three inequalities.\nStudent：I understand. So I should check all three inequalities for each point I pick.\nTeacher：You have identified the correct approach, but you still need to verify whether the point $x=2, y=0$ actually satisfies all three constraints. Let’s check each one.\nStudent：Sure. For the first constraint: $4x-3y-3\\geq0$ becomes $4(2)-3(0)-3=8-0-3=5\\geq0$, so it satisfies the first inequality.\nTeacher：For the second constraint: $x-2y-2\\leq0$ becomes $2-0-2=0\\leq0$, so it satisfies the second inequality. Now check the third constraint: $2x+6y-9\\leq0$ becomes $4+0-9=-5\\leq0$, so it also satisfies the third inequality. Thus, the point $x=2, y=0$ is valid. However, this does not mean it gives the minimum value of $z=x-5y$. You must explore other points on the boundary of the feasible region to find the true minimum.\nStudent：Okay. Should I just try other random points along the boundaries to see which gives the smallest $z$ value?\nTeacher：You are on the right track, but you need to systematically evaluate the objective function $z = x - 5y$ at all vertices of the feasible region, not just random points. This ensures you find the true minimum.\nStudent：Oh, so I should find the intersection points of the boundaries to get all the vertices, then check $z$ at each one?\nTeacher：Yes, you are correct. Your mistake was not considering that the minimum value of $z = x - 5y$ occurs at a vertex of the feasible region, not just any arbitrary point. You must evaluate $z$ at all vertices to determine the true minimum.\nStudent：zzc",
