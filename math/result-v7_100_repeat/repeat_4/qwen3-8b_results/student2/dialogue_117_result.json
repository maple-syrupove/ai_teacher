Have you used the correct trigonometric identity to express $\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ in terms of $\\sin 2\\alpha$?\nStudent：I just thought they were directly related, so I tried to substitute the value for $\\sin 2\\alpha$ into the expression, but I'm not sure if that's the correct connection.\nTeacher：Have you used the identity $\\cos^2\\theta = \\frac{1 + \\cos 2\\theta}{2}$ to rewrite $\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$?\nStudent：No, I did not use that identity. I used $\\cos^2A = 1-\\sin^2A$ instead.\nTeacher：Have you considered that $\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ involves a double angle, and thus requires an identity that relates to $\\sin 2\\alpha$?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider that.
