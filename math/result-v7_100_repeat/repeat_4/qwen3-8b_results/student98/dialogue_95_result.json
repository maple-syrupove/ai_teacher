    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is A. 2 - i.\nTeacher：To check your answer, multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator. Did you do this step correctly?\nStudent：No, I didn’t multiply by the complex conjugate of the denominator.\nTeacher：You multiplied by the conjugate of the numerator instead. Let me know if you'd like to try again.\nStudent：I didn't multiply by the conjugate of the numerator either. I divided the components separately.\nTeacher：You incorrectly separated the real and imaginary parts during division. Let me know if you'd like to try again.\nStudent：Yes, I divided \"5 by 1\" and \"5 by -2i\" separately.\nTeacher：You incorrectly split the numerator into separate components for division. Let me know if you'd like to try again.\nStudent：Yes, I split it into \"5i ÷ 1\" and \"5i ÷ -2i\" separately.\nTeacher：You incorrectly split the numerator into separate components for division. Let me know if you'd like to try again.\nStudent：Yes, I took 5i ÷ 1 = 5i and 5i ÷ -2i = -2.5, then tried to combine them for the answer.\nTeacher：You incorrectly split the numerator and treated the division as separate operations rather than simplifying the entire complex fraction properly. Let me know if you'd like to try again.\nStudent：Yes, I handled them as separate calculations rather than simplifying the entire fraction at once.\nTeacher：You incorrectly treated the division of a complex number as separate real and imaginary components rather than simplifying the entire fraction by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. Let me know if you'd like to try again.\nStudent：Yes, that's what I did—I dealt with the parts separately rather than doing it all together.\nTeacher：You incorrectly approached the problem by splitting the numerator and denominator into separate components for division, rather than simplifying the entire complex fraction by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.\nStudent：zzc",
