    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：\\(\n\\tan\\alpha = \\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\n\\)\nTeacher：Your approach is incorrect. Why did you add $\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ to $\\frac{1}{5}$? What identity are you trying to apply here?\nStudent：I was trying to isolate $\\alpha$ by adding $\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ to both sides of the equation.\nTeacher：That reasoning is flawed. The tangent function is periodic, so adding $\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ to both sides does not isolate $\\alpha$. What property of the tangent function are you forgetting?\nStudent：I forgot that tangents of sums and differences need to use the addition or subtraction formula, not just add angles directly.\nTeacher：You are on the right track, but your equation is still incorrect. The identity $\\tan(\\alpha - \\beta) = \\frac{\\tan \\alpha - \\tan \\beta}{1 + \\tan \\alpha \\tan \\beta}$ should be used, not simply adding angles. What step did you skip in applying this formula?\nStudent：I didn't substitute and solve for $\\tan\\alpha$ using the addition formula; I just tried to add the angle directly.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the tangent addition formula by adding $\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ to $\\frac{1}{5}$, which is not a valid operation. The formula requires substitution of values, not direct angle addition.\nStudent：zzc",
