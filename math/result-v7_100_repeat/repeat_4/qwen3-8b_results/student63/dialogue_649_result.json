    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D.\nTeacher：The condition in D states that two planes are perpendicular to the same plane. Is this sufficient for the planes to be parallel?\nStudent：I thought so, because if they're both perpendicular to the same plane, they seem to be facing the same direction, so I picked D.\nTeacher：If two planes are perpendicular to the same plane, they can still intersect along a line that is perpendicular to the third plane. Therefore, the condition in D is not sufficient for the planes to be parallel.\nStudent：I see. So even if they're both perpendicular to the same plane, they might still intersect?\nTeacher：Yes, they might. So the condition in D is not sufficient. What about the other options?\nStudent：Option A says there are infinitely many lines in α that are parallel to β. Option B says there are two intersecting lines in α that are parallel to β. Option C says both planes are parallel to the same line.\nTeacher：What is the difference between having infinitely many lines in α parallel to β and having two intersecting lines in α parallel to β?\nStudent：If there are two intersecting lines in α parallel to β, their generating plane must be parallel to β. Having infinitely many lines seems stronger, but just two intersecting lines is enough.\nTeacher：You are correct that two intersecting lines in α parallel to β imply α is parallel to β. However, option A states \"infinitely many lines,\" which is not necessary—just two intersecting lines suffice. Therefore, the error is that option A is not a necessary condition.\nStudent：That's right, option B should be sufficient, and option A is stronger than necessary.\nTeacher：You are correct that option B is sufficient and option A is not necessary. Therefore, the error in your initial choice of D was due to misunderstanding the sufficiency of the condition described in D.\nStudent：zzc",
