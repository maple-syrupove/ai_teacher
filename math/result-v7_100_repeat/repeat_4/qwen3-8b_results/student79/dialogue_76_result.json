    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$2\\lambda + 5 \\times 4 = 0$, so $\\lambda = -10$.\nTeacher：Your equation is incorrect. What is the condition for two vectors to be parallel?\nStudent：For two vectors to be parallel, their directions are proportional.\nTeacher：The condition for two vectors to be parallel is that one is a scalar multiple of the other. What does this mean in terms of their components?\nStudent：It means the components of one vector should be proportional to the components of the other.\nTeacher：The components of one vector must be proportional to the components of the other. This means $\\frac{a_x}{b_x} = \\frac{a_y}{b_y}$ or $\\frac{b_x}{a_x} = \\frac{b_y}{a_y}$. What is the correct equation for this condition?\nStudent：The correct equation should be $\\frac{2}{\\lambda} = \\frac{5}{4}$.\nTeacher：Your equation is still incorrect. What is the correct proportionality relationship between the components of $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$?\nStudent：The correct proportionality relationship is $\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{\\lambda}{4}$.\nTeacher：Your equation is still incorrect. What is the correct way to express that $\\vec{a}$ is a scalar multiple of $\\vec{b}$?\nStudent：The correct way is: $(2,5) = k(\\lambda, 4)$ for some scalar $k$.\nTeacher：Your equation is correct, but you have not solved for $\\lambda$. What is the relationship between the components of $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ in terms of $k$?\nStudent：$2 = k\\lambda$ and $5 = k \\times 4$.\nTeacher：From the equations $2 = k\\lambda$ and $5 = 4k$, solve for $k$ using the second equation: $k = \\frac{5}{4}$. Substitute this into the first equation: $2 = \\frac{5}{4}\\lambda$. Solve for $\\lambda$: $\\lambda = \\frac{8}{5}$. Your mistake was not solving the system of equations correctly.\nStudent：That's not where I went wrong. I didn't make a mistake in solving the system.\nTeacher：Your initial equation was $2\\lambda + 5 \\times 4 = 0$, which incorrectly applies a dot product condition instead of the parallelism condition. The correct approach involves proportionality of components, not an algebraic sum.\nStudent：zzc",
