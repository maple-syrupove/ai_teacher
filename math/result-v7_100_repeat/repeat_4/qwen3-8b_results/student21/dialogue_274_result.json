    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is 3.\nTeacher：The distance from a point to a line is calculated using a specific formula. What formula did you use to find the distance?\nStudent：I used the distance formula between two points: $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$.\nTeacher：The distance formula between two points is not applicable here, as you are calculating the distance from a point to a line, not between two points. What is the equation of one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：The asymptotes of a hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ are given by the equations $y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a}x$. What are the values of $a$ and $b$ for this hyperbola?\nStudent：For this hyperbola, $a=4$ and $b=3$.\nTeacher：The asymptotes are $y = \\pm \\frac{3}{4}x$. What is the standard form of the equation for a line to use in the distance formula?\nStudent：The standard form is $Ax + By + C = 0$.\nTeacher：The asymptotes can be rewritten in standard form. For $y = \\frac{3}{4}x$, rearranging gives $\\frac{3}{4}x - y = 0$. Multiply through by 4 to eliminate the fraction: $3x - 4y = 0$. What is the distance from the point $(3, 0)$ to this line?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：The distance from a point $(x_0, y_0)$ to a line $Ax + By + C = 0$ is given by $\\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}$. What is the value of this expression for the line $3x - 4y = 0$ and the point $(3, 0)$?\nStudent：It is $\\frac{|3\\times3 + (-4)\\times0 + 0|}{\\sqrt{3^2+(-4)^2}} = \\frac{9}{5}$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated the distance to one of the asymptotes. However, the question asks for the distance to *one of the asymptotes*, not both. Since both asymptotes are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, the distance from the point $(3, 0)$ to either asymptote is the same. Therefore, your answer $\\frac{9}{5}$ is correct.\nStudent：Okay, thank you.\nTeacher：You're welcome. Your answer of $\\frac{9}{5}$ is correct.\nStudent：Okay, thank you.\nTeacher：You're welcome.
