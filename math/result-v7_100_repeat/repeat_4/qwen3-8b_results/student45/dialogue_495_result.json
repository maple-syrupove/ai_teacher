    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：2\nTeacher：What is the relationship between $ |z_1 + z_2| $ and $ |z_1 - z_2| $ when $ |z_1| = |z_2| $?\nStudent：Since $|z_1| = |z_2|$, we can use the formula $|z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 2(|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2)$.\nTeacher：You correctly recalled the identity, but did you substitute the known values properly? Let me check your calculation.\nStudent：I substituted $|z_1| = |z_2| = 2$, so $2(|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2) = 2(4 + 4) = 16$.\nTeacher：You calculated $ |z_1 + z_2|^2 $ as part of the identity, but did you compute it correctly? Let me check.\nStudent：I took $|z_1 + z_2| = |\\sqrt{3} + i| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 1^2} = 2$.\nTeacher：You calculated $ |z_1 + z_2| $ as 2, but squared it to get $ |z_1 + z_2|^2 = 4 $. This is correct. However, you did not use this in the identity. Did you solve for $ |z_1 - z_2| $ using the identity?\nStudent：I used the formula: $|z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 16$, then substituted $|z_1 + z_2|^2 = 4$, so $4 + |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 16$. Thus $|z_1 - z_2|^2 = 12$, so $|z_1 - z_2| = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\nTeacher：You correctly applied the identity and solved for $ |z_1 - z_2| $. However, your final answer of $ 2\\sqrt{3} $ is incorrect. Let me check your calculation again.\nStudent：Okay.\nTeacher：You calculated $ |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 12 $, but you stated the final answer as $ 2\\sqrt{3} $. This is incorrect. The square root of 12 is $ 2\\sqrt{3} $, so your final answer should be $ 2\\sqrt{3} $. However, this contradicts the given choices or expected answer. Let me check if there was an error in the earlier steps.\nStudent：Okay.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $ |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 12 $, and the square root of 12 is indeed $ 2\\sqrt{3} $. Your final answer is correct.\nStudent：Thank you.\nTeacher：You have correctly solved the problem, and your final answer of $ 2\\sqrt{3} $ is accurate.\nStudent：2\nTeacher：You stated the final answer as 2, but your earlier calculation showed $ |z_1 - z_2| = 2\\sqrt{3} $. This is the error.\nStudent：I see. Sorry for the confusion.\nTeacher：You incorrectly stated the final answer as 2 instead of $ 2\\sqrt{3} $. This is the error.\nStudent：zzc",
