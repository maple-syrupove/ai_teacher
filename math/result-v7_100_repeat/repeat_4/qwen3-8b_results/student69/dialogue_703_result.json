    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. 120 ways\nTeacher：Your answer assumes each volunteer is assigned to a distinct event, but this ignores the requirement that each event must have at least one volunteer. Let's consider how you approached the distribution of volunteers.\nStudent：I thought since there are 5 volunteers and 4 events, I matched them so each volunteer goes to one event, and used A_5^4=120.\nTeacher：Your mistake is assuming that assigning each volunteer to a distinct event satisfies the condition that each event must have at least one volunteer. This approach does not account for the fact that one event will have two volunteers, and you need to consider the distribution of volunteers across events.\nStudent：I see. So instead of just arranging 5 volunteers into 4 places, I should have considered how to distribute the extra volunteer among the events?\nTeacher：You are on the right track, but your reasoning still overlooks the need to account for which volunteer is assigned to which event after distributing the extra one. Let's clarify how you handled the distribution.\nStudent：I didn’t handle the case where one event gets two volunteers; I just assigned one volunteer to each event and left it at that.\nTeacher：Your mistake is failing to account for the fact that after assigning one volunteer to each event, there is still one remaining volunteer who must be assigned to one of the four events. This means you need to multiply by 4 to account for the different ways to assign the extra volunteer.\nStudent：zzc",
