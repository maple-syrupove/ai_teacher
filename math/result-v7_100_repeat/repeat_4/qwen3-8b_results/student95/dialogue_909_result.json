    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose B.\nTeacher：What is the definition of eccentricity for a hyperbola?\nStudent：The eccentricity of a hyperbola is $e = \\frac{c}{a}$, where $c$ is the distance from the center to each focus, and $a$ is the distance from the center to each vertex.\nTeacher：What is the distance between the two foci?\nStudent：The distance between the two foci is $8$.\nTeacher：Teacher：What is the value of $ c $ for this hyperbola?\nStudent：$c = 4$.\nTeacher：Teacher：What is the value of $ a $ for this hyperbola?\nStudent：$a = 3$.\nTeacher：What is the definition of a hyperbola in terms of distances from two fixed points?\nStudent：For any point $P$ on a hyperbola with foci $F_1$ and $F_2$, $||PF_1| - |PF_2|| = 2a$.\nTeacher：What is the value of $ |PF_1| - |PF_2| $ for the point $(-6, 4)$?  \nStudent：$ |PF_1| - |PF_2| = 6 $.  \nTeacher：Then why did you choose $ a = 3 $?\nStudent：Because $2a = 6$, so I got $a = 3$.\nTeacher：The definition of a hyperbola states that the absolute difference of distances from any point on the hyperbola to the foci is $2a$, not the difference itself. You incorrectly used the difference as $2a$.\nStudent：I see. I thought $|PF_1| - |PF_2| = 2a$ directly, so I set $2a=6$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly equated the difference $ |PF_1| - |PF_2| $ to $ 2a $, whereas the correct definition states that the absolute value of this difference is $ 2a $.\nStudent：zzc",
