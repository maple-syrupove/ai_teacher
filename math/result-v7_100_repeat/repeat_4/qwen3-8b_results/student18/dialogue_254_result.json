    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose C. The graph of $f(x)$ is symmetric with respect to the line $x=\\pi$.\nTeacher：To determine symmetry about $ x = \\pi $, we check if $ f(\\pi + a) = f(\\pi - a) $. Let’s test this.\nStudent：OK, substituting $x = \\pi + a$: \n\\[\nf(\\pi + a) = \\sin(\\pi + a) + \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi + a)} = -\\sin a - \\frac{1}{\\sin a}\n\\]\nAnd for $x = \\pi - a$: \n\\[\nf(\\pi - a) = \\sin(\\pi - a) + \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi - a)} = \\sin a + \\frac{1}{\\sin a}\n\\]\nSo, $f(\\pi + a) \\neq f(\\pi - a)$.\nTeacher：Thus, the graph is not symmetric about $ x = \\pi $. Your choice of C is incorrect.\nStudent：Oh, I see. Then which answer is correct?\nTeacher：Let’s examine the symmetry about $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $. Check if $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + a\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - a\\right) $. Proceed.\nStudent：For $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + a$:\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + a\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + a\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + a\\right)} = \\cos a + \\frac{1}{\\cos a}\n\\]\nFor $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - a$:\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - a\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - a\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - a\\right)} = \\cos a + \\frac{1}{\\cos a}\n\\]\nSo, they are equal.\nTeacher：Thus, the graph is symmetric about $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $. Your initial choice of C was incorrect.\nStudent：I understand. So, the correct answer should be D.\nTeacher：D is correct. However, let’s verify the minimum value. You stated the minimum is 2—why?\nStudent：I thought $f(x)$ could be minimized when $\\sin x=1$, so $f(x)=1+1=2$.\nTeacher：Your assumption that the minimum occurs when $\\sin x = 1$ is incorrect. The function $f(x)$ may attain a lower value for other values of $\\sin x$.\nStudent：I see. So I should check for other possible values of $\\sin x$ that could give a lower $f(x)$. How should I proceed?\nTeacher：To find the minimum, consider $ f(x) = \\sin x + \\frac{1}{\\sin x} $. Let $ y = \\sin x $, so $ f(y) = y + \\frac{1}{y} $. The minimum of $ f(y) $ for $ y > 0 $ occurs at $ y = 1 $, giving $ f(y) = 2 $. However, this assumes $ \\sin x > 0 $, which is not always true. Thus, your assumption that the minimum occurs when $ \\sin x = 1 $ is incomplete.\nStudent：So I should also consider when $\\sin x$ is negative or less than 1 to find the global minimum?\nTeacher：Your error is assuming the minimum occurs only when $\\sin x = 1$. You did not consider that $\\sin x$ can be negative, which affects the behavior of $f(x)$.\nStudent：I understand. So, to find the true minimum, I need to consider the range of $\\sin x$ including its negative values and analyze $f(x)$ for those cases as well.\nTeacher：Your error is assuming the minimum occurs only when $\\sin x = 1$. You did not consider that $\\sin x$ can be negative, which affects the behavior of $f(x)$.\nStudent：I understand. So, to find the actual minimum, I should check both positive and negative values of $\\sin x$.\nTeacher：Your error is assuming the minimum occurs only when $\\sin x = 1$. You did not consider that $\\sin x$ can be negative, which affects the behavior of $f(x)$.\nStudent：I see. Should I look for the minimum by analyzing values where $\\sin x$ is negative, such as $-1 < \\sin x < 0$?\nTeacher：Your error is assuming the minimum occurs only when $\\sin x = 1$. You did not consider that $\\sin x$ can be negative, which affects the behavior of $f(x)$.\nStudent：I see. Should I check for critical points of $f(y)=y+\\frac{1}{y}$ on $-1<y<0$ as well?\nTeacher：Your error is assuming the minimum occurs only when $\\sin x = 1$. You did not consider that $\\sin x$ can be negative, which affects the behavior of $f(x)$.\nStudent：I understand. Should I analyze $f(y)$ for $y$ in $(-1, 0)$ in addition to $y$ in $(0, 1]$ for completeness?\nTeacher：Your error is assuming the minimum occurs only when $\\sin x = 1$. You did not consider that $\\sin x$ can be negative, which affects the behavior of $f(x)$.\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：Your error is assuming the minimum occurs only when $\\sin x = 1$. You did not consider that $\\sin x$ can be negative, which affects the behavior of $f(x)$.\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：Your error is assuming the minimum occurs only when $\\sin x = 1$.
