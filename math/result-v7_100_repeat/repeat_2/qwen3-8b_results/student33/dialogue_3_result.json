    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I let $AB = x$, $AC = \\sqrt{2}x$, and used the Law of Cosines in triangles $ADB$ and $ADC$, but got stuck with too many variables left.\nTeacher：You assumed both triangles ADB and ADC can be used with the Law of Cosines, but you didn't account for the relationship between angles at point D. What is the measure of angle ADC?\nStudent：Since I only knew $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$, I couldn't directly find $\\angle ADC$ without additional information.\nTeacher：You assumed that the angles at point D are supplementary, but you didn't verify if points A, D, and C form a straight line or if angle ADC is indeed related to angle ADB through supplementary or complementary relationships. Is there any information about the straightness of line AC or the relationship between angles at D?\nStudent：There is no information that says points A, D, and C are collinear, so we can't assume angle $ADC$ is supplementary to $ADB$.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that angles $\\angle ADB$ and $\\angle ADC$ are supplementary because they form a linear pair at point D. This is a critical geometric relationship that you overlooked.\nStudent：I don't think that relationship was given, so I didn't assume they were supplementary when I tried to solve for $\\angle ADC$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that angles $\\angle ADB$ and $\\angle ADC$ are not supplementary, despite the fact that they form a linear pair at point D. This is a fundamental geometric principle that must be applied.\nStudent：I didn't use that relationship because I wasn't sure if $A$, $D$, and $C$ were collinear, so I treated the angles as unrelated.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that points A, D, and C are not collinear, despite the fact that D lies on segment BC, making angles ∠ADB and ∠ADC supplementary by definition. This fundamental geometric relationship was overlooked.\nStudent：I see, but since D is just a point on BC, I didn't connect that $\\angle ADB + \\angle ADC = 180^\\circ$ directly.\nTeacher：You failed to use the supplementary relationship between ∠ADB and ∠ADC, which is essential for applying the Law of Cosines correctly in triangle ADC. This oversight led to an incorrect setup of equations.\nStudent：I understand. I set up the Law of Cosines separately for both triangles but didn't link the two angles through their sum.\nTeacher：You failed to use the supplementary relationship between ∠ADB and ∠ADC, which is essential for applying the Law of Cosines correctly in triangle ADC. This oversight led to an incorrect setup of equations.\nStudent：I understand. I set up separate cosine formulas for both triangles without linking the angles as supplementary.\nTeacher：You failed to use the supplementary relationship between ∠ADB and ∠ADC, which is essential for applying the Law of Cosines correctly in triangle ADC. This oversight led to an incorrect setup of equations.\nStudent：I understand. I used $AB = x$, $AC = \\sqrt{2}x$, and set up Law of Cosines in $ADB$ and $ADC$ separately but didn't connect the angles.\nTeacher：You failed to use the supplementary relationship between ∠ADB and ∠ADC, which is essential for applying the Law of Cosines correctly in triangle ADC. This oversight led to an incorrect setup of equations.\nStudent：I understand. I tried using the Law of Cosines in both triangles separately, treating the angles independently.\nTeacher：You failed to use the supplementary relationship between ∠ADB and ∠ADC, which is essential for applying the Law of Cosines correctly in triangle ADC. This oversight led to an incorrect setup of equations.\nStudent：zzc",
