    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$S_6 = 2a_6 + 1$\nTeacher：Your assumption that $S_6 = 2a_6 + 1$ is incorrect. The relationship $S_n = 2a_n + 1$ holds for all $n$, but $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, not just a function of $a_n$. What is the relationship between $S_n$ and $S_{n-1}$?\nStudent：$S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n$\nTeacher：You correctly identified the relationship between $S_n$ and $S_{n-1}$. Now, use the given formula $S_n = 2a_n + 1$ and the relationship $S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n$ to express $a_n$ in terms of $S_{n-1}$. What is $a_n$ in terms of $S_{n-1}$?\nStudent：$a_n = S_n - S_{n-1}$\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $a_n = S_n - S_{n-1}$. Now, substitute the given formula $S_n = 2a_n + 1$ into this expression and solve for $a_n$ in terms of $S_{n-1}$. What is the resulting equation?\nStudent：Substituting $S_n = 2a_n + 1$ gives $a_n = (2a_n + 1) - S_{n-1}$.\nTeacher：You have substituted correctly, but now you need to solve for $a_n$ in terms of $S_{n-1}$. What is the simplified form of this equation?\nStudent：So, $a_n = 2a_n + 1 - S_{n-1}$, which leads to $a_n - 2a_n = 1 - S_{n-1}$. That is, $-a_n = 1 - S_{n-1}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the equation to $-a_n = 1 - S_{n-1}$. Now, solve for $S_{n-1}$ in terms of $a_n$. What is the resulting expression?\nStudent：$S_{n-1} = 1 + a_n$\nTeacher：You have correctly derived $S_{n-1} = 1 + a_n$. Now, use the given relationship $S_n = 2a_n + 1$ and substitute $S_{n-1}$ into it to find a recursive formula for $S_n$. What is the resulting equation?\nStudent：$S_n = 2a_n + 1 = 2(S_{n-1} - 1) + 1 = 2S_{n-1} - 1$\nTeacher：You have derived the recursive formula $S_n = 2S_{n-1} - 1$. However, you have not yet used this formula to compute $S_6$. What is the value of $S_1$?\nStudent：Using $n = 1$: $S_1 = 2a_1 + 1$. Since $S_1$ is just $a_1$, so $a_1 = S_1$, so $S_1 = 2S_1 + 1$. Solving: $S_1 = -1$.\nTeacher：You correctly found $S_1 = -1$. Now, use the recursive formula $S_n = 2S_{n-1} - 1$ to compute $S_2, S_3, \\dots, S_6$. What is the value of $S_2$?\nStudent：$S_2 = 2S_1 - 1 = 2(-1) - 1 = -3$\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $S_2 = -3$. Now, use the same recursive formula to compute $S_3$. What is the value of $S_3$?\nStudent：$S_3 = 2S_2 - 1 = 2(-3) - 1 = -7$\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $S_3 = -7$. Now, use the same recursive formula to compute $S_4$. What is the value of $S_4$?\nStudent：$S_4 = 2S_3 - 1 = 2(-7) - 1 = -15$\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $S_4 = -15$. Now, use the same recursive formula to compute $S_5$. What is the value of $S_5$?\nStudent：$S_5 = 2S_4 - 1 = 2(-15) - 1 = -31$\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $S_5 = -31$. Now, use the same recursive formula to compute $S_6$. What is the value of $S_6$?\nStudent：$S_6 = 2S_5 - 1 = 2(-31) - 1 = -63$\nTeacher：You have correctly computed $S_6 = -63$. However, the question asks for $S_6$, and you have already arrived at the correct value. Your final answer is correct.\nStudent：$S_6 = 2a_6 + 1$\nTeacher：Your assumption that $S_6 = 2a_6 + 1$ is incorrect. The relationship $S_n = 2a_n + 1$ holds for all $n$, but $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, not just a function of $a_n$. What is the relationship between $S_n$ and $S_{n-1}$?\nStudent：$S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n$\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the relationship between $S_n$ and $S_{n-1}$. Now, use the given formula $S_n = 2a_n + 1$ and the relationship $S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n$ to express $a_n$ in terms of $S_{n-1}$. What is $a_n$ in terms of $S_{n-1}$?\nStudent：$a_n = S_n - S_{n-1}$\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $a_n = S_n - S_{n-1}$. Now, substitute the given formula $S_n = 2a_n + 1$ into this expression and solve for $a_n$ in terms of $S_{n-1}$. What is the resulting equation?\nStudent：Substituting $S_n = 2a_n + 1$ gives $a_n = (2a_n + 1) - S_{n-1}$.\nTeacher：You have substituted correctly, but now you need to solve for $a_n$ in terms of $S_{n-1}$. What is the simplified form of this equation?\nStudent：So, $a_n = 2a_n + 1 - S_{n-1}$, which leads to $a_n - 2a_n = 1 - S_{n-1}$.
