    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Cannot be determined.\nTeacher：The problem provides sufficient information to determine $ t $. What assumption are you making that leads you to conclude it cannot be determined?\nStudent：I thought that since $\\vec{c}=t\\vec{a}+(1-t)\\vec{b}$, when I expanded $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}$, there was still a $t$ remaining which I couldn't eliminate, so I assumed $t$ couldn't be found.\nTeacher：You assumed that the presence of $ t $ in the expression means it cannot be solved. However, the problem provides enough information to solve for $ t $. What happens when you compute $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} $ explicitly?\nStudent：If I compute $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}$, I get $t(\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a}) + (1-t)(\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{b})$.\nTeacher：You have correctly expanded the dot product. Now, recall that $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are unit vectors with an angle of $60^\\circ$ between them. What is the value of $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}$?\nStudent：$\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} = |\\vec{b}| \\cdot |\\vec{a}| \\cdot \\cos 60^\\circ = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} = \\frac{1}{2} $. What is the value of $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} $?\nStudent：$\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 1$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the values. Now substitute these into your expression for $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} $ and solve for $ t $. What do you get?\nStudent：Substituting, I get $t \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (1-t) \\cdot 1 = 0$. So, $\\frac{t}{2} + 1 - t = 0$.\nTeacher：You have correctly substituted the values. Now simplify the equation $ \\frac{t}{2} + 1 - t = 0 $. What is the simplified form of this equation?\nStudent：$\\frac{t}{2} + 1 - t = 0 \\implies 1 - \\frac{t}{2} = 0$\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the equation. Now solve for $ t $. What value of $ t $ satisfies $ 1 - \\frac{t}{2} = 0 $?\nStudent：Solving for $t$, I get $t = 2$.\nTeacher：You have correctly solved for $ t $, and the value $ t = 2 $ satisfies the equation. Your final answer is correct.\nStudent：Thank you, I understand now.\nTeacher：You have correctly solved the problem and arrived at the correct answer, $ t = 2 $.
