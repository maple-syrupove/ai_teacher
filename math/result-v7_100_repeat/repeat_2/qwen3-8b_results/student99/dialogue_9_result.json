    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I don't know, or I wrote \"insufficient information\".\nTeacher：What is the relationship between the vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ in terms of their dot product?\nStudent：The dot product is $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = |\\vec{a}||\\vec{b}|\\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|\\vec{b}|$.\nTeacher：What is the magnitude of $ |2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 $ in terms of $ |\\vec{b}| $?\nStudent：$|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = |2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2$\nTeacher：You have not correctly expanded the square of the vector expression. The correct expansion is $ |2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = (2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}) \\cdot (2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}) $. Please try again.\nStudent：$(2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}) \\cdot (2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}) = 4|\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2$\nTeacher：You have now correctly expanded the expression. What is the value of $ |2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 $ given that $ |2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}| = \\sqrt{10} $?\nStudent：$|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = (\\sqrt{10})^2 = 10$\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $ |2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = 10 $. Now substitute the known values and solve for $ |\\vec{b}| $. Have you done this?\nStudent：I wrote $10 = 4|\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2$, but could not solve for $|\\vec{b}|$.\nTeacher：You have substituted the known values correctly. Now, replace $ |\\vec{a}| = 1 $ and $ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|\\vec{b}| $ in the equation and solve for $ |\\vec{b}| $. Have you done this?\nStudent：No, I didn't substitute $\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|\\vec{b}|$ into the equation.\nTeacher：You have not substituted the expression for $ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $ into the equation.
