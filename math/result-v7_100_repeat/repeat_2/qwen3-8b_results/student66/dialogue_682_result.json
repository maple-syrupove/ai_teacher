    "question": "3. During the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control period, a supermarket launched an online sales business and can complete the distribution of 1200 orders per day. Due to a sharp increase in the number of orders, a backlog of orders has occurred. To solve the problem, many volunteers enthusiastically signed up to participate in the distribution work. It is known that on a certain day, the supermarket has a backlog of 500 orders that have not been distributed. The probability that the new orders for the next day will exceed 1600 is 0.05. Each volunteer can complete the distribution of 50 orders per day. To ensure that the probability of completing the backlogged orders and the current day's orders on the next day is not less than 0.95, at least how many volunteers are needed?

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A. 10.\nTeacher：To ensure the probability of completing all orders is at least 0.95, you must consider both the backlog and the expected new orders. What is the total number of orders that need to be completed on the next day?\nStudent：It would be 500 (backlog) plus the average number of new orders, so 500 + 1600 × 0.95 = 2030 orders.\nTeacher：You calculated the total orders as 500 + 1600 × 0.95, but this assumes the new orders are fixed at 1600. What is the correct way to account for the probability distribution of new orders?\nStudent：Should I consider the possibility that new orders could exceed 1600, even if it's only a 0.05 probability?\nTeacher：You need to calculate the total orders as 500 plus the expected value of new orders, not multiply by 0.95. What is the expected number of new orders?\nStudent：I think the expected number of new orders is 1600.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the expected number of new orders as 1600, but you still need to account for the variability in new orders. What is the total number of orders that must be completed on the next day, considering both the backlog and the expected new orders?\nStudent：So the total number should be 500 + 1600 = 2100 orders that must be completed on the next day.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated the total number of orders as 2100, but you did not account for the variability in new orders when determining the number of volunteers required. What is the distribution of new orders, and how does it affect the probability of completing all orders?\nStudent：I assumed the probability of exceeding 1600 new orders is 0.05, so most days it's 1600 or fewer new orders. I didn't further use the distribution details in my calculation.\nTeacher：You need to calculate the number of volunteers required such that the probability of completing all orders (backlog + new orders) is at least 0.95, considering the variability in new orders. What is the distribution of new orders, and how does it affect the probability of completing all orders?\nStudent：I only used the 1600 as a fixed average and didn't incorporate the probability distribution beyond that, so I didn't adjust for possible higher values.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed new orders are fixed at 1600, but the problem states there is a 0.05 probability of exceeding 1600. This variability must be considered in your calculation. What is the correct approach to account for this uncertainty?\nStudent：I think the correct approach is to use the average or expected value of new orders, which is 1600, and plan for that amount.\nTeacher：You still assume new orders are fixed at 1600, but the problem specifies a 0.05 probability of exceeding 1600. This variability must be explicitly accounted for in your calculation.\nStudent：zzc",
