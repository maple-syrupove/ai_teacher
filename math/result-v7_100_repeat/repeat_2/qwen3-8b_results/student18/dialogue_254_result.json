    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C.\nTeacher：What is the value of $ f(\\pi - x) $ compared to $ f(\\pi + x) $?\nStudent：$f(\\pi-x)=\\sin(\\pi-x)+\\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi-x)}=\\sin x+\\frac{1}{\\sin x}=f(x)$.\n\n$f(\\pi+x)=\\sin(\\pi+x)+\\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi+x)}=-\\sin x-\\frac{1}{\\sin x}$.\nTeacher：You compared $ f(\\pi - x) $ to $ f(\\pi + x) $, but the question asks about symmetry with respect to the line $ x = \\pi $. You should have checked whether $ f(\\pi - x) = f(\\pi + x) $.\nStudent：I see. If I check $f(\\pi-x)$ and $f(\\pi+x)$, then:\n\n$f(\\pi-x)=f(x),\\ f(\\pi+x)=-f(x)$. \n\nSo $f(\\pi-x)\\ne f(\\pi+x)$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $ f(\\pi - x) \\ne f(\\pi + x) $, so the graph is not symmetric with respect to the line $ x = \\pi $. Your initial choice of C was incorrect.\nStudent：Okay.\nTeacher：You have correctly ruled out option C. Let’s examine the symmetry with respect to $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $. What is $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - x\\right) $ compared to $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + x\\right) $?\nStudent：$f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-x\\right)=\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-x\\right)+\\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-x\\right)}=\\cos x+\\frac{1}{\\cos x}$.\n\n$f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+x\\right)=\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+x\\right)+\\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+x\\right)}=\\cos x+\\frac{1}{\\cos x}$.\n\nSo $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-x\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+x\\right)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly shown that $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - x\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + x\\right) $, so the graph is symmetric with respect to the line $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $.
