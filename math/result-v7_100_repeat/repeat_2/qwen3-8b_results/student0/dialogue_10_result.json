    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by directly differentiating $f(x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$, but I couldn't get a usable answer.\nTeacher：What did you obtain for the derivative $ f'(x) $?\nStudent：I obtained $f'(x) = \\frac{2(x+1)(x^2+1) + \\cos x (x^2+1) - [(x+1)^2+\\sin x]\\cdot 2x}{(x^2+1)^2}$.\nTeacher：Your derivative is algebraically correct, but you did not simplify it properly. Did you attempt to simplify the numerator before solving $ f'(x) = 0 $?\nStudent：I tried to expand and combine like terms in the numerator, but the resulting expression was still quite complicated and hard to solve for $x$.\nTeacher：You did not consider simplifying the numerator by factoring or recognizing patterns that could lead to a more manageable form. Did you check if the numerator can be expressed as a product of simpler terms?\nStudent：I didn’t focus on factoring the numerator; I expanded terms and tried to solve it as is.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the numerator can be simplified by factoring out common terms, which would significantly reduce the complexity of the expression. Let’s explore this further.\nStudent：Okay, should I try factoring out $(x+1)$ or some other term from the numerator?\nTeacher：You should look for common factors in the entire numerator, not just individual terms. Did you check if the entire expression can be factored or rewritten in a simpler form?\nStudent：No, I did not check if the entire numerator could be rewritten in a simpler form. I just kept expanding it.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the numerator can be simplified by rewriting it as a product of simpler terms, which would make solving $ f'(x) = 0 $ more manageable. Let’s explore this further.\nStudent：Should I try to write the numerator as a sum of terms involving $x$ and $\\sin x$, and check if it factors?\nTeacher：You have not yet considered that the numerator might simplify significantly when expressed in terms of $x$ and $\\sin x$, but you have not explored this possibility thoroughly. Let’s try to rewrite the numerator in a more structured way.\nStudent：Should I try to group terms like $2x(x+1)$ with the $-\\ 2x(x+1)$, or look for patterns involving $\\cos x$ and $\\sin x$ together?\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the numerator simplifies significantly when expressed in terms of $x$ and $\\sin x$, but you have not explored this possibility thoroughly. Let’s try to rewrite the numerator in a more structured way.\nStudent：Should I collect all terms with $x$ and all terms with $\\sin x$, and rearrange the numerator accordingly?\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the numerator simplifies significantly when expressed in terms of $x$ and $\\sin x$, but you have not explored this possibility thoroughly. Let’s try to rewrite the numerator in a more structured way.\nStudent：Should I write out the numerator step by step and see if terms combine or cancel more simply?\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the numerator simplifies significantly when expressed in terms of $x$ and $\\sin x$, but you have not explored this possibility thoroughly. Let’s try to rewrite the numerator in a more structured way.\nStudent：Should I start by explicitly writing $2(x+1)(x^2+1)$ as $2x^3+2x^2+2x+2$ and expand the other terms similarly?\nTeacher：Yes, expanding all terms in the numerator will help you identify potential simplifications. Did you check if any terms cancel or combine after expansion?\nStudent：I tried, but after expanding $2(x+1)(x^2+1)$ and the other terms, the resulting polynomial still looked complex and I didn't notice any obvious cancellations.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the numerator simplifies significantly when expressed in terms of $x$ and $\\sin x$, but you have not explored this possibility thoroughly. Let’s try to rewrite the numerator in a more structured way.\nStudent：Should I try expressing all terms in the numerator in terms of $x$, $\\sin x$, and $\\cos x$ to see if any simplification emerges?\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the numerator simplifies significantly when expressed in terms of $x$ and $\\sin x$, but you have not explored this possibility thoroughly.

Let’s try to rewrite the numerator in a more structured way.\nStudent：Should I write all the terms involving $x$ and $\\sin x$ together and check for grouping opportunities?\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the numerator simplifies significantly when expressed in terms of $x$ and $\\sin x$, but you have not explored this possibility thoroughly. Let’s try to rewrite the numerator in a more structured way.\nStudent：Should I write the numerator as $2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 2 + \\cos x (x^2+1) - 2x(x+1)^2 - 2x\\sin x$ and try to combine similar terms?\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the numerator simplifies significantly when expressed in terms of $x$ and $\\sin x$, but you have not explored this possibility thoroughly. Let’s try to rewrite the numerator in a more structured way.\nStudent：Should I try combining the $2x^3$, $-2x^3$, $2x^2$, $-2x^3$, etc., and see if they cancel or group neatly?\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the numerator simplifies significantly when expressed in terms of $x$ and $\\sin x$, but you have not explored this possibility thoroughly. Let’s try to rewrite the numerator in a more structured way.\nStudent：Should I focus first on grouping all $x$-terms, then separately the $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$ terms, and see if simplifications emerge?\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the numerator simplifies significantly when expressed in terms of $x$ and $\\sin x$, but you have not explored this possibility thoroughly. Let’s try to rewrite the numerator in a more structured way.\nStudent：Should I explicitly expand and then gather all similar terms to see if a simpler pattern emerges in the numerator?\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the numerator simplifies significantly when expressed in terms of $x$ and $\\sin x$, but you have not explored this possibility thoroughly.
