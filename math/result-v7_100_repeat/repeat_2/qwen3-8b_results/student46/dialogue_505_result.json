    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$m=\\frac{1}{2}$\nTeacher：The asymptotes of the hyperbola are $y = \\pm \\frac{x}{m}$. Have you correctly identified the equations of the asymptotes?\nStudent：Yes, I used $y = \\pm \\frac{x}{m}$ as the equations of the asymptotes.\nTeacher：The circle equation can be rewritten in standard form. Have you completed the square for $x^2 + y^2 - 4y + 3 = 0$?\nStudent：No, I didn't complete the square for $x^2 + y^2 - 4y + 3 = 0$.\nTeacher：I see. Have you then determined the center and radius of the circle based on its standard form?\nStudent：No, I did not determine the center and radius from the standard form.\nTeacher：You have not correctly identified the center and radius of the circle, which is essential for determining the distance from the center to the asymptotes. Have you calculated the distance from the circle's center to the asymptotes?\nStudent：No, I didn't calculate the distance from the center to the asymptotes.\nTeacher：You have not used the condition that the distance from the circle's center to the asymptotes must equal the circle's radius. Have you applied this condition?\nStudent：No, I did not apply that condition.\nTeacher：You have not used the condition that the distance from the circle's center to the asymptotes must equal the circle's radius.
