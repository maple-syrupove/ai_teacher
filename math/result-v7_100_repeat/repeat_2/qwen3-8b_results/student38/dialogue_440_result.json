    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$\\sin\\theta+\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{5}$\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\tan \\theta$?\nStudent：I didn't calculate $\\tan\\theta$ directly. I only used $\\tan(\\theta+\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：What formula did you use to relate $\\tan(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ to $\\tan \\theta$?\nStudent：I didn't use the tangent sum formula. I just substituted the given value into the R-formula for sine and cosine.\nTeacher：What is the R-formula for $\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta$?\nStudent：The R-formula is $\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{2} \\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the R-formula without considering the quadrant of $\\theta$. What is the sign of $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ in the second quadrant?\nStudent：Since $\\theta$ is in the second quadrant, $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ would be in the second or third quadrant, so $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ could be positive or negative, depending on the exact value of $\\theta$.\nTeacher：You did not account for the sign of $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ when applying the R-formula. This led to an incorrect value for $\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta$.\nStudent：I see. I didn't consider the sign when I substituted the value for $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$.\nTeacher：You failed to determine the correct sign of $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ based on the quadrant of $\\theta$, leading to an incorrect final result.\nStudent：That’s not exactly what happened. I didn’t get the sign wrong intentionally; I substituted values without fully reasoning through the relationships.\nTeacher：You assumed the sign of $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ without verifying it based on the quadrant of $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. This led to an incorrect value for $\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta$.\nStudent：That’s not exactly the case. My substitution wasn’t based on an assumption about the sign.\nTeacher：You did not verify the quadrant of $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ to determine the correct sign of $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$, which is essential for applying the R-formula accurately.\nStudent：That’s not quite what happened. I didn’t focus on the sign from the quadrant; my substitution was more direct.\nTeacher：You substituted a value for $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ without verifying its sign based on the quadrant of $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, which is critical for accurate results.\nStudent：That’s not exactly what happened. My substitution wasn't based on the sign; I directly used values.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the R-formula without verifying the sign of $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ based on its quadrant, leading to an incorrect result.\nStudent：That’s not exactly the case. My error wasn’t just about the sign from the quadrant.\nTeacher：You failed to account for the quadrant of $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ when determining the sign of $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$, which is essential for applying the R-formula accurately.\nStudent：That’s not quite correct. My error wasn’t just about the sign determined by the quadrant.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the R-formula without properly determining the sign of $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ based on its quadrant, which is essential for accuracy.\nStudent：That’s not quite accurate. My substitution didn’t focus on the sign from the quadrant.\nTeacher：You substituted a value for $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ without verifying its sign based on the quadrant of $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, which is critical for accurate results.\nStudent：That’s not exactly the case. My error was not mainly about the sign from the quadrant.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the R-formula without verifying the sign of $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ based on its quadrant, which is essential for accuracy.\nStudent：That’s not quite correct. The main issue wasn’t the sign from the quadrant.\nTeacher：You did not address the quadrant of $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ when determining the sign of $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$, which is critical for applying the R-formula accurately.\nStudent：That’s not quite the main issue. My mistake wasn’t mainly about the sign from the quadrant.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the R-formula without properly determining the sign of $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ based on its quadrant, which is essential for accuracy.\nStudent：That’s not exactly correct. The error wasn’t mainly about the sign from the quadrant.\nTeacher：You failed to use the tangent sum formula to find $\\tan \\theta$, which is necessary to determine the correct sign of $\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta$.\nStudent：I didn’t use the tangent sum formula; I just substituted the value for $\\tan(\\theta+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ directly into the R-formula.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the R-formula without using the tangent sum formula to find $\\tan \\theta$, which is essential for determining the correct sign of $\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta$.\nStudent：That’s not exactly right. My mistake wasn’t about missing the tangent sum formula for the sign.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed the sign of $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ without calculating $\\tan \\theta$ first, which is necessary to determine the correct quadrant of $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\nStudent：That’s not quite correct. I didn’t focus on using $\\tan\\theta$ to find the quadrant.\nTeacher：You did not determine the quadrant of $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ by first finding $\\tan \\theta$, which is essential for identifying the correct sign of $\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$.",
