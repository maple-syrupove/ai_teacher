    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\nTeacher：To find the minimum and maximum values of $ f(x) = \\cos x + (x+1)\\sin x + 1 $ on $[0, 2\\pi]$, you must evaluate the function at critical points and endpoints. Have you checked the derivative to find critical points?\nStudent：I just used the formula for max/min of $A\\sin x + B\\cos x$. I didn't take the derivative.\nTeacher：You assumed the function is of the form $A\\sin x + B\\cos x$, but $f(x)$ includes an additional term $(x+1)\\sin x$, which is not a simple sinusoidal function. Have you considered the derivative to find critical points?\nStudent：No, I didn’t check the derivative; I just looked at the sinusoidal part and used the formula directly.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed the function is purely sinusoidal and applied a formula meant for $A\\sin x + B\\cos x$, ignoring the non-sinusoidal term $(x+1)\\sin x$. Have you computed the derivative of $f(x)$ to find critical points?\nStudent：No, I have not computed the derivative of $f(x)$ to find the critical points.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the function contains a non-sinusoidal term $(x+1)\\sin x$, which requires differentiation to find critical points. Have you computed the derivative of $f(x)$?\nStudent：No, I have not computed the derivative of $f(x)$.\nTeacher：You did not compute the derivative of $ f(x) $, which is essential for finding critical points and determining the function's extrema on the interval. Have you attempted to differentiate $ f(x) $?\nStudent：No, I haven't tried differentiating $f(x)$ yet.\nTeacher：You have not taken the necessary step of differentiating $ f(x) $ to locate critical points, which is crucial for determining its extrema on the interval. Have you attempted to compute $ f'(x) $?\nStudent：No, I haven't attempted to compute $f'(x)$.\nTeacher：You have not computed the derivative of $ f(x) $, which is essential for identifying critical points and determining the function's extrema on the interval. Let's start by finding $ f'(x) $. What do you think the derivative of $ f(x) = \\cos x + (x+1)\\sin x + 1 $ would be?\nStudent：I think the derivative would be $f'(x) = -\\sin x + (x+1)\\cos x + \\sin x$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly simplified the derivative of $(x+1)\\sin x$ as $(x+1)\\cos x$, neglecting the product rule. The correct derivative should include both the derivative of $x+1$ and $\\sin x$. Have you applied the product rule properly?\nStudent：No, I did not apply the product rule when differentiating $(x+1)\\sin x$.\nTeacher：You failed to apply the product rule correctly when differentiating $(x+1)\\sin x$, resulting in an incorrect derivative. This error prevents you from finding the critical points and, consequently, the extrema of the function.\nStudent：zzc",
