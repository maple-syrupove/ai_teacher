    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: k > 0.\nTeacher：The function $ f(x) = kx - \\ln x $ is monotonically increasing on $ (1, +\\infty) $ if its derivative is non-negative on that interval. Did you check the sign of the derivative?\nStudent：Yes, I calculated the derivative $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}$ and looked at its sign.\nTeacher：The derivative $ f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x} $. For $ f(x) $ to be monotonically increasing on $ (1, +\\infty) $, $ f'(x) \\geq 0 $ for all $ x > 1 $. Did you ensure this condition holds for all $ x > 1 $?\nStudent：I just thought $k$ has to be greater than $0$ for $f'(x) \\geq 0$.\nTeacher：To ensure $ f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0 $ for all $ x > 1 $, you must find the minimum value of $ f'(x) $ on $ (1, +\\infty) $. Did you analyze the behavior of $ f'(x) $ as $ x $ approaches infinity and at $ x = 1 $?\nStudent：No, I didn't specifically analyze $f'(x)$ at $x = 1$ and as $x \\to \\infty$.\nTeacher：To ensure $ f'(x) \\geq 0 $ for all $ x > 1 $, you must find the minimum value of $ f'(x) $ on $ (1, +\\infty) $. The minimum occurs as $ x \\to 1^+ $, where $ f'(x) \\to k - 1 $. For $ f'(x) \\geq 0 $, you need $ k - 1 \\geq 0 $, so $ k \\geq 1 $. Your mistake was not considering the behavior of $ f'(x) $ near $ x = 1 $.\nStudent：zzc",
