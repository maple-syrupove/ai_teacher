    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I answered: Cannot be determined.\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\sin \\alpha$ in terms of $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha\\right)$?\nStudent：I am not sure how to directly write $\\sin \\alpha$ just from $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha\\right)$.\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha\\right)$ in terms of $\\sin \\alpha$ and $\\cos \\alpha$?\nStudent：It is $\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\cos\\alpha + \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\sin\\alpha$.\nTeacher：You correctly expanded $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha\\right)$, but you did not substitute the known value of $\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and $\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\nStudent：Oh, $\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\cos\\alpha + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\sin\\alpha$.\nTeacher：You have correctly substituted the values of $\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and $\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. What is the next step?\nStudent：I think we can write $\\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(\\cos\\alpha + \\sin\\alpha)$. But I still don't know how to get $\\sin\\alpha$ or $\\cos\\alpha$ on their own from this.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the equation, but you need to square both sides and use the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2\\alpha + \\cos^2\\alpha = 1$ to solve for $\\sin 2\\alpha$.\nStudent：So, squaring both sides: $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2 (\\cos\\alpha+\\sin\\alpha)^2$.\nTeacher：You have correctly squared both sides, but you need to expand $(\\cos\\alpha + \\sin\\alpha)^2$ and simplify using the Pythagorean identity.\nStudent：$(\\cos\\alpha + \\sin\\alpha)^2 = \\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha + \\sin^2\\alpha$.\nTeacher：You have correctly expanded the square, but you need to simplify using $\\cos^2\\alpha + \\sin^2\\alpha = 1$ and then solve for $\\sin 2\\alpha$.\nStudent：Then that gives $1+2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$, so the left side is $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2=\\frac{1}{2}(1+2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the equation, but you need to isolate $\\sin 2\\alpha$ by solving for it explicitly.\nStudent：So, $2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha = 2x$ if $x = \\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$. Thus, $\\sin 2\\alpha = 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$. I still can't find the value for $\\sin 2\\alpha$ because I don't know $\\sin\\alpha$ and $\\cos\\alpha$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $\\sin 2\\alpha = 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$, but you did not solve for $2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$ using the equation you derived.\nStudent：I have $1 + 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha = \\frac{9}{25} \\times 2$, but I still feel stuck finding $\\sin 2\\alpha$.\nTeacher：You have incorrectly simplified the equation. The left side is $\\frac{9}{25}$, and the right side is $\\frac{1}{2}(1 + 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha)$. You need to solve for $2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$ explicitly.\nStudent：$1 + 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha = \\frac{9}{25} \\times 2$ so $1 + 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha = \\frac{18}{25}$.\nTeacher：You have incorrectly multiplied the right side by 2. The equation should be $\\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha)$.\nStudent：Okay, $\\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly set up the equation. Now solve for $2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$.\nStudent：So, $1 + 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha = 2 \\times \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{18}{25}$. Then $2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha = \\frac{18}{25} - 1 = -\\frac{7}{25}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly solved for $2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$, which is $\\sin 2\\alpha$. However, you did not recognize that $2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha = \\sin 2\\alpha$, so the answer should be $-\\frac{7}{25}$.\nStudent：Oh, I see. I thought I couldn't determine it because I couldn't find $\\sin\\alpha$ or $\\cos\\alpha$ directly, so I gave up.\nTeacher：You incorrectly concluded that the answer could not be determined, but in fact, you were able to solve for $\\sin 2\\alpha$ through algebraic manipulation.\nStudent：zzc",
