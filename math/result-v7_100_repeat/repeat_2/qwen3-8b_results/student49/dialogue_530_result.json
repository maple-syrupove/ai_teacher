    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A.\nTeacher：What is the solution set for the inequality defining set A?\nStudent：The solution set for $x^2 - 2x > 0$ is $x < 0$ or $x > 2$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the solution set for set A. Now, what is the solution set for set B?\nStudent：The solution set for set B is $-\\sqrt{5} < x < \\sqrt{5}$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the solution sets for both A and B. Now, consider the intersection of these two sets. What values of x satisfy both conditions?\nStudent：The intersection would be the values that are both in $x<0$ or $x>2$, and also $-\\sqrt{5}<x<\\sqrt{5}$. So for $x<0$, that would be $-\\sqrt{5}<x<0$. For $x>2$, $2<x<\\sqrt{5}$. So the intersection is $(-\\sqrt{5},0)\\cup(2,\\sqrt{5})$.\nTeacher：Teacher：You correctly identified the intersection. Now, consider the options given. Which option is consistent with this result?\nStudent：Based on my previous calculations, I still think option A is correct.\nTeacher：You concluded that $A \\cap B \\neq \\emptyset$, yet you selected option A, which claims $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$. This is the error.\nStudent：I did not realize that. I thought option A matched my result because I overlooked that the intersection was not empty.\nTeacher：You made a mistake in interpreting the options. Option A claims $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$, but your calculation showed that the intersection is not empty. This was the error.\nStudent：That's not exactly what I did wrong. I understand your point, but it's not the root of my mistake.\nTeacher：You incorrectly selected option A based on a misunderstanding of the intersection result. The error lies in misinterpreting the options and not aligning your conclusion with the correct choice.\nStudent：That's not quite accurate. I think there was a different issue with my reasoning.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that the intersection being non-empty meant option A was correct, when in fact option A claims the intersection is empty. This was the core error.\nStudent：That's not exactly what happened. My mistake was something else.\nTeacher：You incorrectly associated the non-empty intersection with option A, when option A explicitly claims the intersection is empty. This was the core error.\nStudent：That's not exactly what happened. My error was different from that.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that a non-empty intersection supported option A, when option A explicitly claims the intersection is empty. This was the core error.\nStudent：That's not quite right. My error wasn't just about interpreting the intersection and option A.\nTeacher：You misunderstood the relationship between the intersection and the given options. The error lies in selecting option A despite knowing the intersection is non-empty.\nStudent：That's not quite right. My confusion was related to another aspect of the problem.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that the intersection being non-empty supported option A, when option A explicitly claims the intersection is empty. This was the core error.\nStudent：That's not quite right. My mistake concerned a different aspect of the problem.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that the intersection being non-empty supported option A, when option A explicitly claims the intersection is empty. This was the core error.\nStudent：That's not quite what happened. My error was related to another aspect of the problem.\nTeacher：You incorrectly associated the non-empty intersection with option A, when option A explicitly claims the intersection is empty. This was the core error.\nStudent：That's not quite right. My mistake had to do with another aspect of the problem.\nTeacher：You incorrectly selected option A despite knowing the intersection is non-empty. This was the core error.\nStudent：That's not quite the issue. My error was related to something else in the problem.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that the non-empty intersection supported option A, when option A explicitly claims the intersection is empty. This was the core error.\nStudent：That's not quite right. My error was about something else in the problem.\nTeacher：You incorrectly selected option A despite knowing the intersection is non-empty. This was the core error.\nStudent：That's not quite right. My error was actually due to a different reasoning mistake.\nTeacher：You incorrectly associated the non-empty intersection with option A, when option A explicitly claims the intersection is empty. This was the core error.\nStudent：That's not quite right. My mistake stemmed from a different reasoning step in the problem.\nTeacher：You incorrectly selected option A despite knowing the intersection is non-empty. This was the core error.\nStudent：That's not quite right. My mistake was connected to a different reasoning step.\nTeacher：You incorrectly selected option A despite knowing the intersection is non-empty. This was the core error.",
