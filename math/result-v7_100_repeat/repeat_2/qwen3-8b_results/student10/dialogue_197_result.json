    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your answer assumes $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ is equal to $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, which ignores the geometric relationships between the points. Can you explain how you arrived at this conclusion?\nStudent：I saw that $E$ is on $AD$, and I thought from $E$ to $B$ was just like from $A$ to $B$, so I wrote $\\overrightarrow{EB}=\\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ is parallel and equal in magnitude to $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, which is incorrect because $E$ is not aligned with $A$ in the same direction as $B$. Can you explain how you determined the relationship between points $E$, $A$, and $B$?\nStudent：I noticed that $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$, but I didn’t consider the relationship between $E$ and $A$ or $B$ more closely. I just saw $E$ on $AD$ and went straight for $\\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is assuming that the position of $E$ on $AD$ directly translates to a direct vector relationship with $B$. You have not accounted for the fact that $E$ is halfway along $AD$, which affects its position relative to $B$. Can you explain how you determined the vector from $E$ to $B$?\nStudent：I just thought that since $E$ is on $AD$, and I wanted the vector from $E$ to $B$, it would be similar to just going from $A$ to $B$, so I used $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ directly.\nTeacher：Your mistake is assuming that the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ can be directly equated to $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ without considering the position of $E$ relative to $A$ and $B$. You have not accounted for the fact that $E$ is a midpoint, which changes the vector relationship.\nStudent：zzc",
