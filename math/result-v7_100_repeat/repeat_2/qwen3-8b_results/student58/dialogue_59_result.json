    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：The equation is $y=3x$.\nTeacher：Your answer assumes the derivative of $y=3(x^2 + x)e^x$ at $x=0$ is 3, but you did not show your work. What is the derivative of $y=3(x^2 + x)e^x$?\nStudent：The derivative is $y' = 3 \\left[ (2x+1)e^x + (x^2 + x)e^x \\right]$.\nTeacher：Your derivative is correct, but you did not evaluate it at $x=0$. What is the value of the derivative at $x=0$?\nStudent：At $x=0$, $y' = 3[(2 \\times 0 + 1) e^0 + (0^2 + 0) e^0] = 3[1 \\times 1 + 0] = 3$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of the derivative at $x=0$ is correct, but you used it to write the equation of the tangent line as $y=3x$. What is the general formula for the equation of a tangent line at a point $(x_0, y_0)$?\nStudent：The general formula is $y - y_0 = k(x - x_0)$, where $k$ is the slope at $(x_0, y_0)$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the general formula for the tangent line, but you did not apply it properly. What is the point $(x_0, y_0)$ in this case?\nStudent：The point $(x_0, y_0)$ is $(0, 0)$.\nTeacher：You have identified the point correctly, but you did not substitute it into the tangent line formula. What is the equation of the tangent line using the point-slope form with $(x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)$ and slope $k = 3$?\nStudent：Using the point-slope form, the equation is $y = 3(x - 0) + 0$, which simplifies to $y = 3x$.\nTeacher：Your final answer $y = 3x$ is correct. However, you did not explicitly show the substitution into the point-slope formula, which is required for full credit. Have you completed the task?\nStudent：Yes, I have completed the task.\nTeacher：Your answer $y = 3x$ is correct, but you did not explicitly show the substitution into the point-slope formula, which is required for full credit.
