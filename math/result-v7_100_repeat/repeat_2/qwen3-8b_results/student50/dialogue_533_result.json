    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $y= \\pm x$\nTeacher：The eccentricity of a hyperbola is given by $ e = \\frac{c}{a} $, where $ c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $. You have stated the eccentricity is $ \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} $. What is the relationship between $ a $ and $ b $ in terms of the asymptotes?\nStudent：The equations of the asymptotes are $y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a}x$, so the slope depends on the ratio $\\frac{b}{a}$.\nTeacher：Given that $ e = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} $, and $ e = \\frac{c}{a} $, what is the value of $ c $ in terms of $ a $?\nStudent：$c = e \\cdot a = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}a$\nTeacher：You correctly found $ c = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}a $. Since $ c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $, substitute this expression for $ c $ and solve for $ \\frac{b}{a} $. What is the resulting equation?\nStudent：$\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}a\\right)^2 = a^2 + b^2$, so $b^2 = \\frac{5}{4}a^2 - a^2 = \\frac{1}{4}a^2$. Then, $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：The slope of the asymptotes is $ \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{2} $, so the equations of the asymptotes are $ y = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}x $. Therefore, the correct answer is D. What is your final answer?\nStudent：My final answer is D. $y = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}x$\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the slope of the asymptotes as $ \\frac{1}{2} $, leading to the equation $ y = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}x $. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Your final answer is correct.\nStudent：Student：C. $y= \\pm x$\nTeacher：The equations of the asymptotes for a hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ are $y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a}x$. You have selected $y = \\pm x$, implying $\\frac{b}{a} = 1$. However, based on the given eccentricity, $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Your error is assuming $\\frac{b}{a} = 1$ instead of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStudent：zzc",
