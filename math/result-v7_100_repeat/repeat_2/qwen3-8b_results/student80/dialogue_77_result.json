    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I got $d = \\frac{|2-8|}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{5}}$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of the distance uses the point (2, -8), but this is not the right focus of the hyperbola. What is the standard form of the hyperbola, and where are its foci located?\nStudent：The standard form is $\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$, and for this equation, $a^2=4$, $b^2=5$. The foci are at $(\\pm c,0)$, where $c = \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the foci as $(\\pm c, 0)$, but you did not calculate $c$ correctly. What is the value of $c$ for this hyperbola?\nStudent：$c = \\sqrt{4+5} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$. So the foci are at $(\\pm 3, 0)$.\nTeacher：The right focus is at $(3, 0)$, not $(2, -8)$. What is the correct point you should use to calculate the distance?\nStudent：I should use the point $(3, 0)$ to calculate the distance.\nTeacher：The correct point is $(3, 0)$. What is the distance from $(3, 0)$ to the line $x + 2y - 8 = 0$?\nStudent：$d = \\frac{|3-8|}{\\sqrt{1^2+2^2}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\sqrt{5}$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of the distance is correct. The distance from the right focus $(3, 0)$ to the line $x + 2y - 8 = 0$ is $\\sqrt{5}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I understand now.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the right focus as $(3, 0)$ and calculated the distance accurately. Your final answer of $\\sqrt{5}$ is correct.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher.
