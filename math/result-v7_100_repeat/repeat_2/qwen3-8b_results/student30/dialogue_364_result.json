    "question": "18. (12 points) A supermarket plans to order a certain type of yogurt on a monthly basis. The daily stock is the same. The purchase cost is 4 yuan per bottle, and the selling price is 6 yuan per bottle. Unsold yogurt is sold at a reduced price of 2 yuan per bottle and is completely cleared out on the same day. Based on past sales experience, the daily demand is related to the daily maximum temperature (in ${}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$). If the maximum temperature is not less than 25, the demand is 500 bottles; if the maximum temperature is in the interval [20, 25), the demand is 300 bottles; if the maximum temperature is below 20, the demand is 200 bottles. To determine the order plan for June, the maximum temperature data for each day in June for the past three years were collected, resulting in the following frequency distribution table:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline Max Temperature & {$[10,15)$} & {$[15,20)$} & {$[20,25)$} & {$[25,30)$} & {$[30,35)$} & {$[35,40)$} \\\\\n\\hline Number of Days & 2 & 16 & 36 & 25 & 7 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nUse the frequency of the maximum temperature being in each interval to estimate the probability of it being in that interval.\n\n(1) Find the probability that the daily demand for this yogurt in June is no more than 300 bottles.\n\n(2) Let the daily profit from selling this yogurt in June be Y (in yuan). If the daily stock of this yogurt in June is 450 bottles, write down all possible values of Y and estimate the probability that Y is greater than zero.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\nThe total number of days in the data is the sum of the frequencies: $2+16+36+25+7+4 = 90$ days.\n\n(1) The daily demand is no more than 300 bottles when the maximum temperature is less than 25${}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\nThis corresponds to the temperature intervals $[10,15)$, $[15,20)$, and $[20,25)$.\nNumber of days with temperature less than 25${}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ = (Days in $[10,15)$) + (Days in $[15,20)$) + (Days in $[20,25)$)\n$= 2 + 16 + 36 = 54$ days.\nThe estimated probability is the relative frequency:\n$P(\\text{Demand} \\le 300) = \\frac{\\text{Number of days with temp} < 25}{\\text{Total days}} = \\frac{54}{90} = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6$ or $\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\n(2) The daily stock is fixed at 450 bottles. Profit Y depends on the demand, which in turn depends on the temperature.\nProfit = (Revenue from full-price sales) + (Revenue from reduced-price sales) - (Total cost).\nTotal cost = $450 \\times 4 = 1800$ yuan.\n\nCase 1: Temperature $\\ge 25^{\\circ}C$ (Demand = 500 bottles)\nSince demand (500) > stock (450), all 450 bottles are sold at the full price of 6 yuan.\nRevenue = $450 \\times 6 = 2700$.\nProfit Y = $2700 - 1800 = 900$ yuan.\n\nCase 2: Temperature $\\in [20, 25)^{\\circ}C$ (Demand = 300 bottles)\nSince demand (300) < stock (450), 300 bottles are sold at 6 yuan, and the remaining $450-300=150$ bottles are sold at 2 yuan.\nRevenue = $(300 \\times 6) + (150 \\times 2) = 1800 + 300 = 2100$.\nProfit Y = $2100 - 1800 = 300$ yuan.\n\nCase 3: Temperature $< 20^{\\circ}C$ (Demand = 200 bottles)\nSince demand (200) < stock (450), 200 bottles are sold at 6 yuan, and the remaining $450-200=250$ bottles are sold at 2 yuan.\nRevenue = $(200 \\times 6) + (250 \\times 2) = 1200 + 500 = 1700$.\nProfit Y = $1700 - 1800 = -100$ yuan.\n\nSo, the possible values of Y are $\\{900, 300, -100\\}$.\n\nY is greater than zero when the profit is 900 or 300. This occurs when the temperature is $\\ge 20^{\\circ}C$.\nWe need to find the number of days with temperature $\\ge 20^{\\circ}C$. From the table, this is:\n(Days in $[20,25)$) + (Days in $[25,30)$) + (Days in $[30,35)$) + (Days in $[35,40)$)\n$= 36 + 25 + 7 + 4 = 72$ days.\n\nThe estimated probability that Y is greater than zero is:\n$P(Y > 0) = \\frac{\\text{Number of days with temp} \\ge 20}{\\text{Total days}} = \\frac{72}{90} = \\frac{8}{10} = 0.8$ or $\\frac{4}{5}$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：The probability is (2+16+36)/6/90=54/540=0.1.\nTeacher：Your calculation incorrectly sums the number of days for temperature intervals and divides by an incorrect total. The correct denominator should be the total number of days in June, which is 30, not 90.\nStudent：I thought each interval was equally likely, so I divided by 6 and then by 90.\nTeacher：Your misunderstanding lies in the interpretation of the frequency distribution. The total number of days across all intervals is 90, not 30, as it represents three years of data. Therefore, you should divide by 90, not 30, to calculate the probability.\nStudent：Oh, I see. So for each interval, I should use the count divided by 90 to estimate the probability?\nTeacher：Yes, that is correct. Now, identify which temperature intervals correspond to daily demand no more than 300 bottles.\nStudent：The intervals [10,15), [15,20), and [20,25) all correspond to daily demand no more than 300 bottles.\nTeacher：Your identification of the temperature intervals is correct, but you have not yet calculated the probability. The probability is the sum of the frequencies of these intervals divided by the total number of days (90).\nStudent：So, the probability is (2+16+36)/90 = 54/90 = 0.6.\nTeacher：Your calculation is now correct. The probability that the daily demand is no more than 300 bottles is 0.6.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I understand now.\nTeacher：You are welcome. For part (2), you need to calculate the profit for each possible demand level and determine the probability that the profit is greater than zero. Let me know your approach.\nStudent：For each demand level:\n\n- If demand is 200: All 200 sold at 6 yuan, remaining 250 sold at 2 yuan.\n- If demand is 300: 300 at 6 yuan, 150 at 2 yuan.\n- If demand is 500: Only 450 sold at 6 yuan (stock limit), rest unmet.\n\nI'll use these to find Y.\nTeacher：Your approach is on the right track, but you have not considered the probabilities of each demand level. You need to calculate the expected profit for each scenario and then determine the probability that Y > 0.\nStudent：Okay. For demand 200 (intervals [10,15), [15,20)), probability: (2+16)/90=18/90=0.2. For 300 (interval [20,25)), probability: 36/90=0.4. For 500 (intervals [25,30), [30,35), [35,40)), probability: (25+7+4)/90=36/90=0.4. I'll calculate Y for each and check which cases have Y>0.\nTeacher：Your probabilities are correctly calculated, but you have not yet computed the profit $ Y $ for each demand level. You need to calculate $ Y $ for each scenario and then determine the probability that $ Y > 0 $.\nStudent：For demand 200: Revenue = 200×6 + 250×2 = 1200 + 500 = 1700. Cost = 450×4 = 1800. So, Y = 1700 - 1800 = -100.  \n\nFor demand 300: Revenue = 300×6 + 150×2 = 1800 + 300 = 2100. Cost = 1800. So, Y = 2100 - 1800 = 300.  \n\nFor demand 500: All 450 sold at 6 yuan. Revenue = 450×6 = 2700. Cost = 1800. Y = 2700 - 1800 = 900.  \n\nSo possible Y: -100, 300, 900. \n\nProbability Y > 0: 0.4 (for 300) + 0.4 (for 500) = 0.8.\nTeacher：Your calculation of possible values for $ Y $ is correct, but the probability that $ Y > 0 $ should be calculated as the sum of the probabilities for demand levels where $ Y > 0 $, which are 300 and 500. You have correctly identified these probabilities as 0.4 and 0.4, respectively. Therefore, the probability that $ Y > 0 $ is indeed 0.8.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher.\nTeacher：Your calculation of the possible values for $ Y $ is correct, but the probability that $ Y > 0 $ should be calculated as the sum of the probabilities for demand levels where $ Y > 0 $, which are 300 and 500.
