    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I wrote: \"There is no solution for φ, because the two functions are in different forms and cannot be equal.\"\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that the functions cannot be equal due to their forms, but this overlooks the possibility of phase shifts aligning them. Let's consider how shifting affects the function's form. Is there a specific transformation that could make the two functions equivalent?\nStudent：I only considered their forms, so I didn't try any specific transformation to make them equivalent.\nTeacher：Your error lies in not recognizing that a horizontal shift can transform one trigonometric function into another, even if they initially appear different. Let's explore how shifting affects the phase of the cosine function. What happens when you shift $ y = \\cos(2x + \\phi) $ to the right by $ \\frac{\\pi}{2} $?\nStudent：When $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ is shifted to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, it becomes $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi - 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$.\nTeacher：Your transformation is correct, but you have not yet equated it to the given sine function. Let's consider the relationship between cosine and sine. Can you express $ \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi) $ in terms of sine?\nStudent：$\\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi) = -\\cos(2x + \\phi),$ but I didn't try expressing it in terms of sine.\nTeacher：You have not utilized the identity that relates cosine and sine, such as $ \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) $, which is essential for equating the two functions. Let's explore this relationship.\nStudent：zzc",
