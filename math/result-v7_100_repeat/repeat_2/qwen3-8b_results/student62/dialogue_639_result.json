    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option C, $c < a < b$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that $a = \\log_2 0.2$ is greater than $c = 0.2^{0.3}$. Let’s examine the relationship between $a$ and $c$. Is $a$ negative or positive?\nStudent：$a = \\log_2 0.2$ is negative, because $0.2 < 1$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $a$ is negative. Now, is $c = 0.2^{0.3}$ positive or negative?\nStudent：$c = 0.2^{0.3}$ is positive, because any positive number raised to a real power remains positive.\nTeacher：You’ve correctly noted that $a$ is negative and $c$ is positive. Therefore, $a < c$. This contradicts your initial choice of option C. What is the sign of $b = 2^{0.2}$?\nStudent：$b = 2^{0.2}$ is positive, since any positive number to a real power stays positive.\nTeacher：You’ve established that $a < c$ and both $b$ and $c$ are positive. However, you have not compared $b$ and $c$. What is the relationship between $b = 2^{0.2}$ and $c = 0.2^{0.3}$?\nStudent：I think $b = 2^{0.2}$ and $c = 0.2^{0.3}$. Since $2^{0.2}$ is greater than $1$, and $0.2^{0.3}$ is less than $1$, so $b > c$.\nTeacher：You concluded $b > c$, which is correct, but you still have not established the correct ordering of all three values. What is the approximate value of $a = \\log_2 0.2$?\nStudent：$a = \\log_2 0.2 = \\log_2 \\frac{1}{5} = -\\log_2 5 \\approx -2.32$.\nTeacher：You have correctly approximated $a \\approx -2.32$. Now, what is the approximate value of $c = 0.2^{0.3}$?\nStudent：$c = 0.2^{0.3} = e^{0.3 \\ln 0.2} \\approx e^{0.3 \\times (-1.609)} \\approx e^{-0.4827} \\approx 0.617$.\nTeacher：You have correctly approximated $a \\approx -2.32$ and $c \\approx 0.617$. Now, what is the approximate value of $b = 2^{0.2}$?\nStudent：$b = 2^{0.2} = e^{0.2 \\ln 2} \\approx e^{0.2 \\times 0.693} \\approx e^{0.1386} \\approx 1.149$\nTeacher：You have correctly approximated $a \\approx -2.32$, $c \\approx 0.617$, and $b \\approx 1.149$. Therefore, the correct ordering is $a < c < b$, which corresponds to option B.\nStudent：Oh, I see. Thank you for the explanation.\nTeacher：You have now correctly identified the ordering $a < c < b$, which corresponds to option B. Your initial choice was incorrect due to a misjudgment in the relationship between $a$ and $c$. Well done on recognizing your mistake and understanding the correct order.\nStudent：zzc",
