    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D (α and β are perpendicular to the same plane).\nTeacher：The condition in D implies that α and β are parallel, but does it guarantee that α is parallel to β? Let me ask: Can two planes be perpendicular to the same plane but not parallel to each other?\nStudent：Yes, two planes can be perpendicular to the same plane but not parallel to each other.\nTeacher：Then the condition in D is not sufficient for α to be parallel to β. Let me ask: What is the correct necessary and sufficient condition for two planes to be parallel?\nStudent：The correct necessary and sufficient condition is that there are two intersecting lines in α that are parallel to β.\nTeacher：You have identified the correct necessary and sufficient condition. However, let me ask: Does option B state this correctly?\nStudent：Yes, option B states that there are two intersecting lines in α that are parallel to β, which is correct.\nTeacher：Then your initial choice of D was incorrect. The correct answer is B.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：You initially chose D, but the correct answer is B. The condition in D is not sufficient for α to be parallel to β. The correct necessary and sufficient condition is that there are two intersecting lines in α that are parallel to β. Therefore, your initial choice was incorrect.\nStudent：zzc",
