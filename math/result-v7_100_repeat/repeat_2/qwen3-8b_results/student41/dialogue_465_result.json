    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is $2.484$.\nTeacher：What method did you use to find the maximum value of the function?\nStudent：I used the completing the square method when I saw the $\\sin^2 x$ term.\nTeacher：What did you do with the $\\sqrt{3} \\cos x$ term after completing the square?\nStudent：I included it as part of the terms while grouping to complete the square.\nTeacher：I see. Did you consider the domain of the function when evaluating the maximum value?\nStudent：I only used the expression I found, not specifically the domain $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$, when getting the maximum value.\nTeacher：You did not account for the domain $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ when determining the maximum value. This may have led to an incorrect result.\nStudent：I don't think that was the main issue. I believe my method for rewriting the function determined my answer.\nTeacher：You assumed the maximum occurs at a critical point without verifying it lies within the domain $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$. This is a key error.\nStudent：That was not my main mistake. My main error was related to how I rewrote the function, not just the critical point.\nTeacher：You incorrectly rewrote the function by completing the square without properly accounting for the relationship between $\\sin^2 x$ and $\\cos x$, leading to an inaccurate expression.\nStudent：zzc",
