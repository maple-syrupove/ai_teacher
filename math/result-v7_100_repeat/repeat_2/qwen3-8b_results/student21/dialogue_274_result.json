    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is 3.\nTeacher：The distance from a point to a line is calculated using a specific formula. Did you use the correct formula for the distance from a point to a line?\nStudent：No, I didn't use that formula.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that the formula was not used. Did you find the equations of the asymptotes first?\nStudent：No, I did not find the equations of the asymptotes first.\nTeacher：You need to find the equations of the asymptotes before calculating the distance. Did you recall the general form of the asymptotes for a hyperbola of the form $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$?\nStudent：No, I did not recall the general form of the asymptote equations.\nTeacher：You need to recall that the asymptotes of a hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ are given by $y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a}x$.
