    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option B: $b>a>c$.\nTeacher：To determine the correct order, let's consider the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. What is the approximate value of $\\cos \\frac{1}{4}$?\nStudent：I calculated $\\cos \\frac{1}{4}$ to be about $0.97$.\nTeacher：What is the approximate value of $\\sin \\frac{1}{4}$?\nStudent：I calculated $\\sin \\frac{1}{4}$ to be about $0.25$.\nTeacher：What is the approximate value of $c = 4 \\sin \\frac{1}{4}$?\nStudent：I calculated $c$ to be about $1.0$.\nTeacher：Teacher：If $a = \\frac{31}{32}$, what is its approximate decimal value?\nStudent：$a = \\frac{31}{32}$ is approximately $0.96875$.\nTeacher：Teacher：Now, let's compare the approximate values: $b \\approx 0.97$, $a \\approx 0.96875$, and $c \\approx 1.0$. What is the correct order?\nStudent：The correct order should be $c > b > a$.\nTeacher：Based on your calculations, $c \\approx 1.0$, $b \\approx 0.97$, and $a \\approx 0.96875$. Therefore, the correct order is $c > b > a$, which corresponds to option A. Your initial choice of B was incorrect.\nStudent：zzc",
