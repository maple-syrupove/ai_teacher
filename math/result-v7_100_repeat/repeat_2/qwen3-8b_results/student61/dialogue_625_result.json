    "question": "8. (5 points) The Chinese mathematician Chen Jingrun achieved world-leading results in the study of Goldbach's Conjecture. Goldbach's Conjecture states that 'every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes', for example, $30=7+23$. If two distinct numbers are randomly selected from the prime numbers not exceeding 30, what is the probability that their sum is 30?

You have not listed the pairs. Let me ask: Which prime numbers less than or equal to 30 can be paired with another prime number to sum to 30?\nStudent：I know that 7 and 23 can be paired to sum to 30.\nTeacher：What other prime numbers less than or equal to 30 can be paired with another prime number to sum to 30?\nStudent：I am not sure of any others besides (7, 23). I had only thought of that pair.\nTeacher：You have missed several valid pairs. For example, 13 and 17 also sum to 30. Let me ask: Are there any other prime numbers less than or equal to 30 that can be paired with another prime number to sum to 30?\nStudent：I didn't think of others.
