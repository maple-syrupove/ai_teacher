    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My wrong answer is: 2.\nTeacher：For the parabola $ y^2 = 4x $, what is the standard form and location of its focus?\nStudent：The standard form is $y^2 = 4x$, and the focus is at $(1, 0)$.\nTeacher：For the parabola $ y^2 = 4x $, the focus is at $ (1, 0) $. What is the distance from point B $ (3, 0) $ to the focus?\nStudent：The distance from point B (3,0) to the focus (1,0) is |3-1| = 2.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated the distance from B to the focus as 2. However, you assumed |AF| = |BF| implies A is at a specific location without considering the parabola's definition. What is the definition of a parabola in terms of distance from a point and a line?\nStudent：A parabola is the set of points equidistant from a fixed point called the focus and a fixed line called the directrix.\nTeacher：You correctly recalled the definition of a parabola. If |AF| = |BF|, then point A must be equidistant from the focus and the directrix. However, you did not use this property to find the coordinates of A. What is the equation of the directrix for the parabola $ y^2 = 4x $?\nStudent：The equation of the directrix is $x = -1$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the directrix as $x = -1$. Since $|AF| = |BF|$, point A must lie on the parabola and also satisfy the condition of being equidistant from the focus and the directrix. However, you did not use this to find the coordinates of A or calculate $|AB|$. What is the distance from a point on the parabola to the directrix?\nStudent：The distance from a point $(x, y)$ on the parabola to the directrix $x = -1$ is $|x + 1|$.\nTeacher：Since $|AF| = |BF|$, and point A is on the parabola, the distance from A to the directrix must equal the distance from A to the focus. However, you did not equate these distances to find the coordinates of A. What is the relationship between the distance from a point on the parabola to the focus and the distance to the directrix?\nStudent：For any point $(x,y)$ on the parabola, the distance to the focus $(1,0)$ is equal to the distance to the directrix $x = -1$. So, $|(x-1)^2 + y^2|^{1/2} = |x+1|$.\nTeacher：You correctly set up the equation, but you did not solve it to find the coordinates of point A. What is the value of $ y^2 $ for any point on the parabola $ y^2 = 4x $?\nStudent：For any point on the parabola $y^2 = 4x$, $y^2 = 4x$.\nTeacher：You have the equation $ \\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2} = |x+1| $. Since $ y^2 = 4x $, substitute this into the equation and solve for $ x $. Did you do this?\nStudent：No, I did not substitute $y^2 = 4x$ into the equation and solve for $x$.\nTeacher：You have the equation $ \\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2} = |x+1| $. Since $ y^2 = 4x $, substitute this into the equation and solve for $ x $. Did you do this?\nStudent：No, I didn't. I only considered the case where $y=0$ to simplify the situation.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed $ y = 0 $ to simplify the problem, which does not account for all possible points on the parabola satisfying the given condition. This led to an incomplete solution.\nStudent：zzc",
