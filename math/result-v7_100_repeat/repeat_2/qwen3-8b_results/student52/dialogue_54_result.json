This is a misapplication of the tangent addition formula. What is the correct identity for $\\tan(\\alpha - \\beta)$?\nStudent：The correct identity is \\(\\tan(\\alpha - \\beta) = \\frac{\\tan\\alpha - \\tan\\beta}{1 + \\tan\\alpha\\tan\\beta}\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly recalled the identity, but you have not applied it properly. Given $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}$, what is $\\tan(\\frac{5\\pi}{4})$?\nStudent：\\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly identified $\\tan\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1$, but you have not substituted this value into the identity. What is the value of $\\tan\\alpha$ in terms of $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4})$ and $\\tan\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)$?\nStudent：\\(\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) + \\tan(\\frac{5\\pi}{4})}{1 - \\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4})\\tan(\\frac{5\\pi}{4})}\\)\nTeacher：You have incorrectly rearranged the identity. The correct rearrangement requires solving for $\\tan\\alpha$ algebraically, not directly substituting values into a rearranged formula. What is the correct form of the equation after substituting $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\tan\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1$?\nStudent：The correct form is \\(\\frac{\\tan\\alpha - 1}{1 + \\tan\\alpha \\cdot 1} = \\frac{1}{5}\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly substituted the values into the identity, but you have not solved for $\\tan\\alpha$ algebraically. What is the next step in solving the equation $\\frac{\\tan\\alpha - 1}{1 + \\tan\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{5}$?\nStudent：The next step is to cross-multiply: \\(5(\\tan\\alpha - 1) = 1 + \\tan\\alpha\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly cross-multiplied, but you have not simplified the equation properly. What is the simplified form of $5(\\tan\\alpha - 1) = 1 + \\tan\\alpha$?\nStudent：The simplified form is \\(5\\tan\\alpha - 5 = 1 + \\tan\\alpha\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the equation, but you have not isolated $\\tan\\alpha$ properly. What is the next step in solving $5\\tan\\alpha - 5 = 1 + \\tan\\alpha$?\nStudent：The next step is to subtract \\(\\tan\\alpha\\) from both sides: \\(5\\tan\\alpha - \\tan\\alpha - 5 = 1\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly subtracted $\\tan\\alpha$ from both sides, but you have not simplified the equation properly. What is the simplified form of $4\\tan\\alpha - 5 = 1$?\nStudent：The simplified form is \\(4\\tan\\alpha = 6\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified to $4\\tan\\alpha = 6$, but you have not solved for $\\tan\\alpha$ completely. What is the final value of $\\tan\\alpha$?\nStudent：\\(\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\nTeacher：You have correctly solved for $\\tan\\alpha$, but you have not considered the periodicity and potential quadrant restrictions of the tangent function. What is the general solution for $\\tan\\alpha$?\nStudent：The general solution is \\(\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}\\), so \\(\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) + k\\pi\\), where \\(k\\) is any integer.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the general solution, but the question specifically asks for $\\tan \\alpha$, not $\\alpha$. The value $\\frac{3}{2}$ is already the value of $\\tan \\alpha$, so no further computation is needed.\nStudent：Okay, so my final answer is $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nTeacher：Your final answer $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$ is correct.
