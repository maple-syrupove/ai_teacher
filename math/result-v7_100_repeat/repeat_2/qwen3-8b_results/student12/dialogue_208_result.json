    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：D. $\\{0,1,2\\}$\nTeacher：A is the set of all real numbers greater than or equal to 1. Does this mean 0 is in A?\nStudent：No, 0 is not in A, because $0-1 = -1$ which is less than 0.\nTeacher：Teacher：So, if 0 is not in A, but 1 and 2 are, what is the correct intersection?\nStudent：The correct intersection is $\\{1,2\\}$.\nTeacher：C. $\\{1,2\\}$\nStudent：Yes, option C. $\\{1,2\\}$ is the correct intersection.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the intersection as $\\{1,2\\}$.
