    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. 10\nTeacher：To find the coefficient of $x^5 y^2$ in the expansion of $(x^2 + x + y)^5$, you need to consider how the terms can combine to give $x^5 y^2$. Let's examine your reasoning. How did you arrive at the answer 10?\nStudent：I saw $x^5 y^2$ and thought about getting $x^5$ and $y^2$ out of the expansion, so I used the binomial coefficient for choosing 2 $y$’s from 5, which is 10.\nTeacher：You considered only the $y$ term, but the expression contains three terms: $x^2$, $x$, and $y$. Your approach assumes a binomial expansion, but this is a trinomial expansion. You need to account for all three terms in your reasoning.\nStudent：zzc",
