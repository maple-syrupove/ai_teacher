    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose $\\overrightarrow{E B} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your answer assumes that point E is the same as point B, which is incorrect. Can you explain how you arrived at this conclusion?\nStudent：I saw that E is on AD, so I thought maybe $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ just equals $\\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ is the same as $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, which ignores the position of point E relative to B. Can you explain how you determined the relationship between E and B?\nStudent：I did not consider the relationship fully. I just saw B and used $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ without thinking about E’s actual position on $AD$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is assuming that vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ can be directly equated to $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ without considering the position of E on segment $AD$. Can you explain how you determined the coordinates or position of E?\nStudent：I did not determine the coordinates or position of E; I just used the information that E is on AD.\nTeacher：Your mistake is not considering the proportional relationship between E and D on segment AD, which affects the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. Can you explain how you accounted for the position of E along AD?\nStudent：I didn't account for E's position on AD. I just went straight to using $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ without figuring out E's specific location.\nTeacher：Your mistake is failing to use the proportional relationship between E and D on segment AD, which is essential for determining the correct vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. Can you explain how you determined the position of E relative to A and D?\nStudent：I didn't determine E's position relative to A and D. I only knew E is the midpoint of AD but didn't use that information in my answer.\nTeacher：Your mistake is not using the fact that E is the midpoint of AD to determine its position relative to A and D, which is essential for computing the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. Can you explain how you used the midpoint information?\nStudent：I didn't use the midpoint information at all in my calculation. I just wrote $\\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is not using the midpoint information to express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$. Can you explain how you would express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ using vector addition?\nStudent：I didn't break down $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ using vector addition; I just assumed it equals $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, without involving $\\overrightarrow{AC}$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is not decomposing $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ into components involving both $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$, which are necessary to express the vector correctly.\nStudent：zzc",
