    "question": "20. (12 points) In the Cartesian coordinate system $xOy$, the curve $C: y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}$ intersects the line $l: y=k x+a(a>0)$ at two points M and N.\n\n(I) When $k=0$, find the equations of the tangent lines to C at points M and N respectively.\n\n(II) Does there exist a point P on the y-axis such that for any value of k, we always have $\\angle O P M=\\angle O P N$? (Explain your reasoning)\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution: (I) When $k=0$, the line equation becomes $l: y=a$.\nTo find the intersection points M and N, we solve the system:\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y=a \\\\ y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\end{array}\\right.$\nThis gives $\\frac{x^2}{4} = a$, so $x^2 = 4a$, which means $x = \\pm 2\\sqrt{a}$.\nWithout loss of generality, let $M$ be the point with the positive x-coordinate. So, the coordinates are $M(2 \\sqrt{a}, a)$ and $N(-2 \\sqrt{a}, a)$.\n\nThe derivative of the curve $C: y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}$ is $y' = \\frac{2x}{4} = \\frac{x}{2}$.\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at M is $y'|_{x=2\\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{a}}{2} = \\sqrt{a}$.\nThe equation of the tangent line at M is $y - a = \\sqrt{a}(x - 2\\sqrt{a})$.\n$y - a = \\sqrt{a}x - 2a$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{a}x - y - a = 0$.\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at N is $y'|_{x=-2\\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{-2\\sqrt{a}}{2} = -\\sqrt{a}$.\nThe equation of the tangent line at N is $y - a = -\\sqrt{a}(x - (-2\\sqrt{a}))$.\n$y - a = -\\sqrt{a}x - 2a$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{a}x + y + 3a = 0$. (Note: there is a calculation error in the original Chinese answer for the tangent at N. It should be $y-a = -\\sqrt{a}(x+2\\sqrt{a}) \\implies y-a = -\\sqrt{a}x - 2a \\implies \\sqrt{a}x + y + a = 0$). Let's use the correct one: $\\sqrt{a}x + y + a = 0$.\n\n(II) Yes, such a point exists. The point is $P(0, -a)$.\nLet $P$ be a point $(0, b)$ on the y-axis. Let the intersection points be $M(x_1, y_1)$ and $N(x_2, y_2)$. The condition $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ (where O is the origin) means that the line segment OP (which is on the y-axis) is the angle bisector of $\\angle MPN$. This implies that the angles that PM and PN make with the y-axis are equal. This is equivalent to saying that the slopes of PM and PN are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign (i.e., $k_{PM} = -k_{PN}$, or $k_{PM} + k_{PN} = 0$), assuming M and N are on opposite sides of the y-axis (which they are, as we will see).\n\nLet's find the intersection points by solving the system:\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y=kx+a \\\\ y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\end{array}\\right.$\n$\frac{x^2}{4} = kx+a \\implies x^2 - 4kx - 4a = 0$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum and product of the roots are: $x_1 + x_2 = 4k$ and $x_1x_2 = -4a$.\nSince $a>0$, $x_1x_2$ is negative, meaning one root is positive and one is negative, so M and N are on opposite sides of the y-axis.\n\nThe slopes of PM and PN are $k_{PM} = \\frac{y_1-b}{x_1}$ and $k_{PN} = \\frac{y_2-b}{x_2}$.\nWe require $k_{PM} + k_{PN} = 0$.\n$\\frac{y_1-b}{x_1} + \\frac{y_2-b}{x_2} = 0$\n$\\frac{x_2(y_1-b) + x_1(y_2-b)}{x_1x_2} = 0$\n$x_2y_1 - bx_2 + x_1y_2 - bx_1 = 0$\nSubstitute $y_1 = kx_1+a$ and $y_2 = kx_2+a$:\n$x_2(kx_1+a) - bx_2 + x_1(kx_2+a) - bx_1 = 0$\n$kx_1x_2 + ax_2 - bx_2 + kx_1x_2 + ax_1 - bx_1 = 0$\n$2k(x_1x_2) + (a-b)(x_1+x_2) = 0$\nNow substitute the values from Vieta's formulas:\n$2k(-4a) + (a-b)(4k) = 0$\n$-8ak + 4k(a-b) = 0$\nSince this must hold for any value of $k$, we can divide by $4k$ (assuming $k \neq 0$. If $k=0$, the condition holds trivially as the setup is symmetric).\n$-2a + (a-b) = 0$\n$-a - b = 0$\n$b = -a$\n\nThus, the point P must be $(0, -a)$. This point is independent of $k$. Therefore, such a point exists, and its coordinates are $(0, -a)$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：(II) First, let P be $(0, b)$ on the y-axis. The coordinates of M and N are the intersection points of $y = \\frac{x^2}{4}$ and $y = kx + a$. So, set $\\frac{x^2}{4} = kx + a$, then $x^2 - 4kx - 4a = 0$. Let the roots be $x_1$ and $x_2$, so $M(x_1, kx_1+a)$ and $N(x_2, kx_2+a)$.\n\nNow, let’s try to use the angle bisector property, that $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ implies that the lengths $|\\angle MPO|$ and $|\\angle NPO|$ with respect to P are equal. So, let’s try to write the slopes $\\frac{kx_1+a-b}{x_1}$ and $\\frac{kx_2+a-b}{x_2}$, and set up the condition that their angles with OP are equal. I try to write the vectors $\\overrightarrow{PM}$ and $\\overrightarrow{PN}$, and find the angle conditions. But after I start writing out the expressions and equations, it becomes very complicated, and I’m unable to isolate $b$ or find a clear form for the coordinates of P. I get stuck on the algebra and can’t proceed further.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that equal angles imply equal slopes. The condition $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ does not translate directly to slope equality; it requires vector angle or reflection properties.\nStudent：I thought if the angles were equal then their slopes from P would have some simple relation, so I tried to equate the slopes, but the algebra became very complicated and I couldn't isolate $b$.\nTeacher：You misapplied the angle condition. The equality of angles $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ implies that point P lies on the angle bisector of $\\angle MPN$, not that slopes are equal. You need to use vector dot products or reflection properties instead.\nStudent：But when I started to use the vector dot product to write $\\cos$ formulas for the angles, the expressions with $k$, $x_1$, $x_2$, and $b$ became messy, and I still couldn't solve for $b$.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are roots of the quadratic, so they satisfy $x_1 + x_2 = 4k$ and $x_1 x_2 = -4a$. Use these relationships to simplify your expressions before solving for $b$.\nStudent：Okay, if $x_1 + x_2 = 4k$ and $x_1 x_2 = -4a$, then the coordinates of M and N are $(x_1, kx_1+a)$ and $(x_2, kx_2+a)$. I can substitute these root-coefficient relationships to try to simplify the vectors from $P(0,b)$ to $M$ and $N$.\nTeacher：You have not yet applied the angle condition correctly. You need to express the angle equality using vector dot products or slopes with respect to point P, and then use the relationships between $x_1$ and $x_2$ to simplify.\nStudent：I tried expressing the vectors $\\overrightarrow{PM}$ and $\\overrightarrow{PN}$ in terms of $x_1$, $x_2$, $k$, and $b$, then writing the cosine of the angles using dot products. But even after substituting $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1 x_2$, the equations were still too complex and I couldn’t get a value for $b$.\nTeacher：You have not properly applied the angle condition. The equality $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ implies that point P lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment MN, not that the dot product expressions simplify directly. You need to use geometric properties of symmetry or reflection instead.\nStudent：I see, but I tried to directly calculate or establish the angle bisector’s geometric condition algebraically. After writing out the vectors and all the $k$, $x_1$, $x_2$, and $b$ terms, my equations got complicated, and I couldn’t simplify or solve for $b$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed the angle condition implies a direct algebraic relationship between vectors. The correct approach involves recognizing that for $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$, point $P$ must lie on the perpendicular bisector of segment $MN$. This geometric insight simplifies the problem significantly.\nStudent：zzc",
