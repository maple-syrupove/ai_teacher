Their directions change as BC changes.\nTeacher：The dot product $\\overrightarrow{PA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{PD}$ depends on the angle between them and their magnitudes. Did you consider how the angle and magnitudes change as BC varies?\nStudent：I mainly considered the magnitudes, but not how the angle between $\\overrightarrow{PA}$ and $\\overrightarrow{PD}$ would change with different positions of BC.\nTeacher：You did not account for the dynamic relationship between the angle and magnitudes as BC varies, which is essential for determining the maximum value.\nStudent：zzc",
