    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is 2.\nTeacher：For the parabola $ y^2 = 4x $, the focus $ F $ is at $ (1, 0) $. You calculated $ |AF| = |BF| $, but did you correctly compute the distance between points $ A $ and $ B $? Let me clarify: Did you use the correct coordinates for point $ A $?\nStudent：I chose $A(1,0)$ since it's on the parabola and also made $|AF|=|BF|$.\nTeacher：You assumed point $ A $ is at $ (1, 0) $, but this point is actually the focus $ F $, not a distinct point on the parabola. Did you verify that point $ A $ lies on the parabola $ y^2 = 4x $?\nStudent：Yes, I checked that $(1,0)$ is on the parabola since $0^2 = 4 \\times 1$.\nTeacher：You have incorrectly identified the coordinates of point $ A $. The point $ (1, 0) $ is the focus $ F $, not a distinct point on the parabola. Did you solve for the coordinates of point $ A $ using the condition $ |AF| = |BF| $?\nStudent：I only considered $y=0$ and found $A(1,0)$ to satisfy $|AF|=|BF|$.\nTeacher：You assumed that the only solution to $ |AF| = |BF| $ is when $ A $ lies on the x-axis, but there may be other points on the parabola satisfying this condition. Did you consider all possible coordinates for point $ A $ on the parabola?\nStudent：No, I only considered the case where $y=0$ for point $A$.\nTeacher：You limited your search to points on the x-axis, but there are other points on the parabola $ y^2 = 4x $ that satisfy $ |AF| = |BF| $. Did you set up the correct equation for the distance $ |AF| $ in terms of the coordinates of point $ A $?\nStudent：I used $A(x,0)$, so $|AF| = |BF|$ became equations just for $y=0$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly restricted point $ A $ to the x-axis by assuming $ y = 0 $, even though the parabola $ y^2 = 4x $ includes points with non-zero $ y $-coordinates. Did you use the general coordinates of a point on the parabola to set up the equation $ |AF| = |BF| $?\nStudent：No, I didn't use the general coordinates. I only used $y=0$.\nTeacher：You restricted point $ A $ to the x-axis by assuming $ y = 0 $, which is incorrect. The parabola $ y^2 = 4x $ includes points with non-zero $ y $-coordinates. Did you use the general form $ A(x, y) $ where $ y^2 = 4x $ to set up the equation $ |AF| = |BF| $?\nStudent：No, I only set $y=0$ and didn't use $A(x, y)$ with $y^2=4x$ for the equation.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that point $ A $ must lie on the x-axis by setting $ y = 0 $, whereas the parabola $ y^2 = 4x $ includes points with non-zero $ y $-coordinates. This led to an incomplete analysis of the problem.\nStudent：zzc",
