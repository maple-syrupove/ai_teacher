    "correct_answer": "Solution: (1) We are given an arithmetic sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ with the first term $a_1 = -7$.\nWe are also given that the sum of the first 3 terms is $S_3 = -15$.\nThe formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$, where $d$ is the common difference.\nFor $n=3$, we have:\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + (3-1)d) = -15$\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + 2d) = 3(a_1+d) = -15$.\nDivide by 3: $a_1 + d = -5$.\nSubstitute the given value $a_1 = -7$:\n$-7 + d = -5$\n$d = 2$.\n\nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting $a_1=-7$ and $d=2$:\n$a_n = -7 + (n-1)2 = -7 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 9$.\n\n(2) To find the formula for $S_n$, we use the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$.\n$S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(-7 + (2n-9)) = \\frac{n}{2}(2n - 16) = n(n-8) = n^2 - 8n$.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $S_n$, we can treat $S_n = n^2 - 8n$ as a quadratic function of $n$. This is an upward-opening parabola. Its minimum value occurs at the vertex.\nThe vertex of a parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is at $x = -b/(2a)$.\nFor our function, the vertex is at $n = -(-8)/(2\\cdot1) = 4$.\nSince $n=4$ is a positive integer, the minimum value of the sequence $S_n$ occurs at $n=4$.\nLet's find the value of $S_4$:\n$S_4 = 4^2 - 8(4) = 16 - 32 = -16$.\nAlternatively, we can complete the square for $S_n$: \n$S_n = n^2 - 8n = (n^2 - 8n + 16) - 16 = (n-4)^2 - 16$.\nThe minimum value of this expression is -16, which occurs when $n=4$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $S_n$ is -16.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：The general term formula I got is $a_n = -7 -4(n-1) = -4n-3$.\nTeacher：Your general term formula is incorrect. Let's examine how you derived it. What is the common difference of the sequence?\nStudent：I calculated the common difference as $d = -4$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of the common difference is incorrect. Let's verify it using the given information. What is the value of $a_2$?\nStudent：Using my formula, $a_2 = -7 + (-4) = -11$.\nTeacher：The value of $a_2$ is incorrect. Let's calculate it using the given information. What is the value of $S_3$?\nStudent：The value of $S_3$ is $-15$.\nTeacher：The value of $S_3$ is correct. Let's calculate $a_2$ using the given information. What is the value of $a_2$ based on $S_3 = -15$?\nStudent：Given $a_1 = -7$ and $S_3 = -15$, $a_2$ is unknown.\nTeacher：Let’s use the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence:  \n$$\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)\n$$  \nGiven $S_3 = -15$, substitute $n = 3$ and $a_1 = -7$:  \n$$\n-15 = \\frac{3}{2}(2(-7) + 2d)\n$$  \nSolve for $d$. What value do you get?\nStudent：Let's substitute the values:\n$$\n-15 = \\frac{3}{2}(-14 + 2d)\n$$\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n$$\n-30 = 3(-14 + 2d)\n$$\nDivide both sides by 3:\n$$\n-10 = -14 + 2d\n$$\nSo, $2d = 4$, hence $d = 2$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of the common difference $d$ is correct. Now, let's verify your general term formula using this value of $d$. What is the general term formula with $a_1 = -7$ and $d = 2$?\nStudent：The general term formula is $a_n = -7 + 2(n-1)$.\nTeacher：Your general term formula is incorrect. Let's simplify $a_n = -7 + 2(n-1)$. What is the simplified form?\nStudent：The simplified form is $a_n = 2n - 9$.\nTeacher：Your simplified general term formula is incorrect. Let's simplify $a_n = -7 + 2(n-1)$ step by step. What is the expanded form of $2(n-1)$?\nStudent：The expanded form of $2(n-1)$ is $2n - 2$.\nTeacher：The expanded form is correct. Now, add $-7$ to $2n - 2$. What is the result?\nStudent：$-7 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 9$\nTeacher：Your simplification is correct, but the general term formula $a_n = 2n - 9$ is not equivalent to $a_n = -7 + 2(n-1)$. Let's verify by substituting $n = 1$. What value do you get for $a_1$ using $a_n = 2n - 9$?\nStudent：Substituting $n = 1$ into $a_n = 2n - 9$, we get $a_1 = 2 \\times 1 - 9 = -7$.\nTeacher：Your substitution is correct, but the general term formula $a_n = 2n - 9$ is equivalent to $a_n = -7 + 2(n-1)$. Therefore, your general term formula is correct.\nStudent：Okay, I understand. Thank you.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the general term formula as $a_n = 2n - 9$. Now, let's move on to part (2). What is the formula for $S_n$ in terms of $n$?\nStudent：The formula for $S_n$ is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}\\big(2a_1 + (n-1)d\\big)$.\nTeacher：Your formula for $S_n$ is correct, but you have not substituted the known values of $a_1$ and $d$ into it. What is the value of $S_n$ when you substitute $a_1 = -7$ and $d = 2$?\nStudent：Substituting the values, we have:\n$$S_n = \\frac{n}{2}\\big(2 \\times (-7) + (n-1)\\times 2\\big)$$\nTeacher：Your substitution is correct, but you have not simplified the expression inside the parentheses. What is the simplified form of $2 \\times (-7) + (n-1)\\times 2$?\nStudent：The simplified form is $-14 + 2(n-1)$.\nTeacher：Your simplification is correct, but you have not fully simplified the expression. What is the expanded form of $-14 + 2(n-1)$?\nStudent：The expanded form is $-14 + 2n - 2$, which simplifies to $2n - 16$.\nTeacher：Your expanded form is correct, but you have not substituted it back into the formula for $S_n$. What is the full expression for $S_n$ after substitution and simplification?\nStudent：The full expression for $S_n$ is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (2n - 16)$.\nTeacher：Your expression for $S_n$ is incorrect. Let's simplify $\\frac{n}{2}(2n - 16)$. What is the simplified form of this expression?\nStudent：The simplified form is $S_n = n(n - 8)$.\nTeacher：Your simplified expression for $S_n$ is incorrect. Let's simplify $\\frac{n}{2}(2n - 16)$ step by step. What is the result of distributing $\\frac{n}{2}$ across $(2n - 16)$?\nStudent：Distributing $\\frac{n}{2}$, we get $S_n = n(n - 8)$.\nTeacher：Your simplification is incorrect. Let's distribute $\\frac{n}{2}$ across $(2n - 16)$. What is the correct result?\nStudent：$\\frac{n}{2} \\times 2n = n^2$, and $\\frac{n}{2} \\times (-16) = -8n$, so $S_n = n^2 - 8n$.\nTeacher：Your simplification is correct, but you have not identified the minimum value of $S_n$. What is the vertex of the quadratic function $S_n = n^2 - 8n$?",
