    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is 3.\nTeacher：The distance from a point to a line is calculated using a specific formula. Can you recall the formula for the distance from a point $(x_0, y_0)$ to a line $Ax + By + C = 0$?\nStudent：Is it $\\left|\\frac{Ax_0+By_0+C}{\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}\\right|$?\nTeacher：Yes, that is the correct formula. Now, can you recall the equations of the asymptotes for the hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{16} - \\frac{y^2}{9} = 1$?\nStudent：Are they $y = \\frac{3}{4}x$ and $y = -\\frac{3}{4}x$?\nTeacher：Yes, those are the correct asymptotes. Now, can you write the equations of the asymptotes in the form $Ax + By + C = 0$?\nStudent：Sure. The equations can be written as $3x - 4y = 0$ and $3x + 4y = 0$.\nTeacher：You have correctly rewritten the asymptotes. Now, let's consider the distance from the point $(3, 0)$ to one of these lines. Which line did you choose?\nStudent：I chose the line $3x - 4y = 0$.\nTeacher：I see. Now, let's compute the distance using the formula. Did you substitute the point $(3, 0)$ into the formula correctly?\nStudent：I think I substituted $x_0=3$ and $y_0=0$ into the formula with $A=3$, $B=-4$, $C=0$.\nTeacher：You substituted the values correctly, but you forgot to include the absolute value in your calculation. Let me clarify: the formula is $\\left|\\frac{Ax_0 + By_0 + C}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}\\right|$. Did you compute the numerator and denominator separately before applying the absolute value?\nStudent：No, I just computed $3 \\times 3 + 0$ and then divided by $\\sqrt{9+0}$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly simplified the numerator and denominator without considering the full formula. Let's recalculate using the correct values. What is $Ax_0 + By_0 + C$ for the line $3x - 4y = 0$ and point $(3, 0)$?\nStudent：It is $3 \\times 3 + (-4) \\times 0 + 0 = 9$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated the numerator as 9, but you did not account for the denominator $\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}$. What is the value of $\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}$ for the line $3x - 4y = 0$?\nStudent：It is $\\sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$.\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated both the numerator and denominator. Now, apply the absolute value and divide: $\\left|\\frac{9}{5}\\right| = \\frac{9}{5}$. Your final answer was 3, but this is incorrect. The correct answer is $\\frac{9}{5}$, which corresponds to option A.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：You forgot to apply the absolute value and divide by the denominator in your final calculation. The correct answer is $\\frac{9}{5}$.\nStudent：zzc",
