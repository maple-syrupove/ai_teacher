    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Let $AB = x$, $AC = \\sqrt{2}x$, $AD = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$. I set $BD = y$, $BC = 3y$ and wrote out the Law of Cosines for $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle ADC$, but didn't know the values for $AB$ or $AC$, so got stuck.\nTeacher：You applied the Law of Cosines in triangles ABD and ADC, but you did not account for the relationship between angles and sides properly. Specifically, you may have misapplied the angle or failed to consider the full triangle configuration. Let me ask: Did you use the correct angle measure in both triangles?\nStudent：For $\\triangle ABD$, I used $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$, but for $\\triangle ADC$, I didn't have the angle, so I got stuck there.\nTeacher：You correctly used the angle in $\\triangle ABD$, but you neglected to consider the supplementary angle in $\\triangle ADC$. Specifically, $\\angle ADC = 180^\\circ - 135^\\circ = 45^\\circ$. This is a critical oversight in applying the Law of Cosines to $\\triangle ADC$.\nStudent：I see. For $\\triangle ADC$, I didn't use $45^\\circ$. I wasn't sure how to find $\\angle DAC$ or $\\angle ADC$ directly, so I left it blank.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that $\\angle ADC = 45^\\circ$ due to the linear pair formed by $\\angle ADB$ and $\\angle ADC$. This omission prevented you from applying the Law of Cosines effectively in $\\triangle ADC$.\nStudent：I understand. I couldn't figure out $\\angle ADC$'s value, so I just left that part unworked and didn't continue.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that $\\angle ADC = 45^\\circ$ because it forms a linear pair with $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$. This critical angle relationship was not used in your calculations.\nStudent：I didn't realize that, so I left $\\triangle ADC$ incomplete and focused only on $\\triangle ABD$.\nTeacher：You failed to use the angle relationship between $\\angle ADB$ and $\\angle ADC$, which are supplementary. This prevented you from applying the Law of Cosines effectively in $\\triangle ADC$.\nStudent：zzc",
