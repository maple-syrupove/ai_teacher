    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Let $|\\vec{b}|=x$.\nTeacher：Using the formula for the magnitude of a vector difference, $ |2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = (2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}) \\cdot (2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}) $. Expanding this, you should get $ 4|\\vec{a}|^2 + |\\vec{b}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $. Did you correctly expand the dot product?\nStudent：I expanded it to $4|\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2$, so yes, that's the formula I used.\nTeacher：You correctly expanded the expression. Now, using the given information that $ |\\vec{a}| = 1 $ and $ \\angle(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) = 45^\\circ $, you should substitute $ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = |\\vec{a}||\\vec{b}|\\cos(45^\\circ) $. Did you use this formula for the dot product?\nStudent：No, I didn't substitute the dot product using the angle information at that step.\nTeacher：You missed substituting the dot product $ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $ using the angle between the vectors. This is essential for finding $ |\\vec{b}| $.\nStudent：zzc",
