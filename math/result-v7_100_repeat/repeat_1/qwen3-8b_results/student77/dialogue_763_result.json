(12 points) \n(I) Discuss the monotonicity of the function $f(x)=\\frac{x-2}{x+2} e^{x}$, and prove that when $x>0$, $(x-2)e^{x}+x+2>0$.\n\n(II) Prove that when $a \\in[0,1)$, the function $g(x)=\\frac{e^{x}-a x-a}{x^{2}}(x>0)$ has a minimum value. Let the minimum value of $g(x)$ be $h(a)$, and find the range of the function $h(a)$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\n(I) To discuss the monotonicity of $f(x)$, we find its derivative, $f'(x)$. The domain of f(x) is $(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, +\\infty)$.\nUsing the quotient rule and product rule: $f'(x) = \\left(\\frac{(1)(x+2) - (x-2)(1)}{(x+2)^2}\\right)e^x + \\left(\\frac{x-2}{x+2}\\right)e^x = \\left(\\frac{4}{(x+2)^2} + \\frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{(x+2)^2}\\right)e^x$\n$f'(x) = \\frac{4 + x^2 - 4}{(x+2)^2}e^x = \\frac{x^2 e^x}{(x+2)^2}$.\nSince $x^2 \\ge 0$, $e^x > 0$, and $(x+2)^2 > 0$ for $x \\neq -2$, we have $f'(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$ in the domain. The derivative is 0 only at $x=0$. \nTherefore, $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing on $(-\\infty, -2)$ and on $(-2, +\\infty)$.\n\nTo prove the inequality for $x>0$: since $f(x)$ is increasing on $(-2, +\\infty)$, for any $x>0$, we have $f(x) > f(0)$.\n$f(0) = \\frac{0-2}{0+2}e^0 = \\frac{-2}{2}(1) = -1$.\nSo, for $x>0$, we have $\\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x > -1$. \nMultiplying by $(x+2)$ (which is positive for $x>0$):\n$(x-2)e^x > -(x+2)$\n$(x-2)e^x + x+2 > 0$. The proof is complete.\n\n(II) To find the minimum of $g(x)$, we find its derivative $g'(x)$ for $x>0$.\n$g'(x) = \\frac{(e^x-a)(x^2) - (e^x-ax-a)(2x)}{x^4} = \\frac{x(e^x-a) - 2(e^x-ax-a)}{x^3}$\n$g'(x) = \\frac{xe^x - ax - 2e^x + 2ax + 2a}{x^3} = \\frac{(x-2)e^x + ax + 2a}{x^3}$\n$g'(x) = \\frac{(x+2)(\\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x + a)}{x^3}$.\nSince $x>0$, the sign of $g'(x)$ is determined by the sign of the term $G(x) = \\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x + a = f(x)+a$.\n\nFrom part (I), $f(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x>0$. Also, $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(x) = f(0) = -1$ and $\\lim_{x\\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$. So, for $x>0$, the range of $f(x)$ is $(-1, \\infty)$.\nWe are looking for roots of $G(x)=0$, which is $f(x) = -a$. \nSince $a \\in [0, 1)$, we have $-a \\in (-1, 0]$. Since $-a$ is in the range of $f(x)$ for $x>0$, and $f(x)$ is strictly increasing, there exists a unique solution $t>0$ such that $f(t)=-a$.\n\n- When $0 < x < t$, $f(x) < f(t) = -a$, so $G(x) < 0$, which means $g'(x) < 0$. Thus, $g(x)$ is decreasing.\n- When $x > t$, $f(x) > f(t) = -a$, so $G(x) > 0$, which means $g'(x) > 0$. Thus, $g(x)$ is increasing.\nThis confirms that $g(x)$ has a unique minimum value at $x=t$. The minimum value is $h(a) = g(t) = \\frac{e^t-at-a}{t^2}$.\n\nTo find the range of $h(a)$, we express it in terms of $t$. From $f(t)=-a$, we have $a = -f(t) = -\\frac{t-2}{t+2}e^t$.\nSubstitute $a$ into the expression for $h(a)$:\n$h(a) = \\frac{e^t - (t+1)a}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t + (t+1)\\frac{t-2}{t+2}e^t}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(1 + \\frac{t^2-t-2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(\\frac{t+2+t^2-t-2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(\\frac{t^2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$.\n\nSo, the minimum value is a function of $t$: $h(a) = k(t) = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$.\nWe need to find the range of $k(t)$ for the possible values of $t$. \n$t$ is defined by $f(t) = -a$, where $a \\in [0, 1)$. This means $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$. \nWe need to find the values of $t>0$ for which $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$.\n$f(0)=-1$, and $f(2)=0$. Since $f(x)$ is increasing for $x>0$, $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$ corresponds to $t \\in (0, 2]$.\n\nNow we find the range of $k(t) = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$ for $t \\in (0, 2]$.\n$k'(t) = \\frac{e^t(t+2) - e^t(1)}{(t+2)^2} = \\frac{e^t(t+1)}{(t+2)^2}$.\nFor $t>0$, $e^t>0$, $t+1>0$, and $(t+2)^2 > 0$, so $k'(t) > 0$. \nThus, $k(t)$ is strictly increasing on $(0, 2]$.\nThe range of $k(t)$ is therefore $(k(0), k(2)]$.\n$k(0) = \\frac{e^0}{0+2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$k(2) = \\frac{e^2}{2+2} = \\frac{e^2}{4}$.\nThe range of $h(a)$ is $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{e^2}{4}]$.\n",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：For (II), I differentiated $g(x)$ directly:\n\n$$\ng'(x) = \\frac{(e^{x} - a)x^2 - 2x(e^{x} - a x - a)}{x^4}\n$$\nTeacher：Your derivative calculation is incorrect. Did you apply the quotient rule correctly? Specifically, did you differentiate the numerator and denominator properly?\nStudent：I differentiated the numerator as $(e^{x} - a x - a)' = e^{x} - a$, and the denominator as $(x^2)' = 2x$. Then I used the quotient rule: $[u/v]' = (u'v - uv')/v^2$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in the differentiation of the numerator. The derivative of $e^x - ax - a$ is not $e^x - a$, but rather $e^x - a$. However, you missed applying the chain rule correctly when differentiating $e^x - ax - a$. Let me clarify: did you account for the derivative of the entire numerator, including all terms?\nStudent：I took the derivative of $e^x$ as $e^x$, $-ax$ as $-a$, and $-a$ as $0$, then combined them to get $e^x - a$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in the derivative of the numerator. The term $-a$ in the numerator is a constant, so its derivative is indeed 0. However, you must differentiate the entire numerator $e^x - ax - a$ correctly as $e^x - a$, which you did. Therefore, your derivative calculation is actually correct. Let me ask: did you simplify the expression for $g'(x)$ properly after applying the quotient rule?\nStudent：I tried to expand and combine the terms in the numerator, but the result was complicated. I got:\n$$\ng'(x)=\\frac{(e^{x}-a)x^2-2x(e^{x}-a x-a)}{x^4}\n$$\nand couldn't simplify it further.\nTeacher：Your expression for $ g'(x) $ is algebraically correct, but you did not simplify it sufficiently to analyze the critical points or determine the behavior of $ g(x) $. Did you attempt to factor or simplify the numerator further?\nStudent：I tried, but it still looked messy after expansion; I couldn't find a clear factorization or simplification that helped analyze critical points.\nTeacher：Your issue lies in not simplifying the numerator of $ g'(x) $ sufficiently to identify critical points or analyze the behavior of $ g(x) $. Did you attempt to factor or cancel terms in the numerator?\nStudent：I expanded and tried factoring, but I didn't see any terms that could be combined or canceled to make it easier.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in not recognizing that further simplification of the numerator is essential to analyze the critical points and behavior of $ g(x) $. Did you consider factoring out common terms or rewriting the expression in a more manageable form?\nStudent：I thought about factoring out $x$, but after expansion, the terms still looked complicated, so I didn't proceed further with that approach.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in not simplifying the numerator of $ g'(x) $ sufficiently to identify critical points or analyze the behavior of $ g(x) $. Did you consider factoring out common terms or rewriting the expression in a more manageable form?\nStudent：I tried, but after some attempts to factor or rewrite it, I still wasn't able to make the expression simple enough to proceed.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in not recognizing that further simplification of the numerator is essential to analyze the critical points and behavior of $ g(x) $. Did you consider factoring out common terms or rewriting the expression in a more manageable form?\nStudent：I tried, but I couldn't make the numerator simple enough to identify any useful information or patterns.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in not recognizing that the numerator of $ g'(x) $ can be simplified to reveal the critical points and behavior of $ g(x) $. Did you consider substituting specific values or analyzing the sign of the numerator?\nStudent：I didn't try substituting specific values or analyzing the sign; I was mainly focused on algebraic simplification.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in not analyzing the sign of the numerator of $ g'(x) $, which is crucial for determining the critical points and behavior of $ g(x) $. Did you consider evaluating the sign of the numerator for different intervals?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider evaluating the sign of the numerator for different intervals. I focused on algebraic manipulation.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in not analyzing the sign of the numerator of $ g'(x) $, which is essential for determining the critical points and behavior of $ g(x) $. Evaluating the sign of the numerator across different intervals would help identify where $ g(x) $ is increasing or decreasing.\nStudent：zzc",
