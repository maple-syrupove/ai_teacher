    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to differentiate $f(x)$ directly to find the extrema, but the derivative got really messy and I couldn't solve for the critical points, so I couldn't find a specific value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：Your approach is correct in principle, but you may have made a mistake in simplifying the derivative or in solving for critical points. Let me ask: Did you simplify the derivative before attempting to solve for critical points?\nStudent：No, I did not simplify the derivative before trying to solve for critical points.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not simplifying the derivative before attempting to solve for critical points, which likely led to an overly complex expression and hindered your progress.\nStudent：That's not exactly my mistake. I didn't attempt to simplify the derivative before proceeding.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that simplifying the derivative is essential for identifying critical points efficiently. This oversight likely caused the complexity you encountered.\nStudent：That's not quite right. I just started differentiating directly without looking for ways to simplify first.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not recognizing the importance of simplifying the derivative before attempting to solve for critical points, which led to unnecessary complexity in your calculations.\nStudent：That's not exactly it. I didn't focus on simplification of the derivative, but rather tried differentiation directly.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not simplifying the derivative before attempting to solve for critical points, which led to unnecessary complexity in your calculations.\nStudent：That's not quite accurate. I just tried differentiating directly without transforming the original expression first.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not simplifying the original function before differentiation, which could have made the derivative more manageable and the critical points easier to identify.\nStudent：That's not completely correct. I tried differentiating directly without attempting to transform the original expression first.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not simplifying the original function before differentiation, which could have made the derivative more manageable and the critical points easier to identify.\nStudent：That's not the main issue. I attempted to apply differentiation to the original expression as it was.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not recognizing that simplifying the original function before differentiation could have significantly reduced the complexity of the derivative and made finding critical points more manageable.\nStudent：That's not exactly it. I focused on differentiating the original expression directly without first looking for a structural transformation.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not recognizing that simplifying the original function before differentiation could have significantly reduced the complexity of the derivative and made finding critical points more manageable.\nStudent：That's not exactly my mistake. I differentiated the original function as given, without transforming it first.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not recognizing that simplifying the original function before differentiation could have significantly reduced the complexity of the derivative and made finding critical points more manageable.\nStudent：That's not exactly my mistake. I tried differentiating the function as it was, without transforming it.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not recognizing that simplifying the original function before differentiation could have significantly reduced the complexity of the derivative and made finding critical points more manageable.\nStudent：That's not precisely my mistake. I directly attempted differentiation on the given function, without transforming it first.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not recognizing that simplifying the original function before differentiation could have significantly reduced the complexity of the derivative and made finding critical points more manageable.\nStudent：That's not exactly what happened. I just started differentiating the given function directly, without transforming it.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not recognizing that simplifying the original function before differentiation could have significantly reduced the complexity of the derivative and made finding critical points more manageable.\nStudent：That's not exactly my error. I just differentiated the formula directly, without transforming it first.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not recognizing that simplifying the original function before differentiation could have significantly reduced the complexity of the derivative and made finding critical points more manageable.\nStudent：That's not quite my mistake. I just went ahead with differentiation directly, not transforming $f(x)$ into another form.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not recognizing that simplifying the original function before differentiation could have significantly reduced the complexity of the derivative and made finding critical points more manageable.\nStudent：That's not exactly it.
