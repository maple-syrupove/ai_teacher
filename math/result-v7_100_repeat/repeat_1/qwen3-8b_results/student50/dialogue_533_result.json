    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $y= \\pm x$\nTeacher：The eccentricity of a hyperbola is given by $ e = \\frac{c}{a} $, where $ c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $. You have stated the eccentricity is $ \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} $. What is the relationship between $ a $ and $ b $ in terms of the asymptotes?\nStudent：For the asymptotes, the equation is $y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a} x$, so the relationship involves the ratio $\\frac{b}{a}$.\nTeacher：Given that $ e = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} $, and $ e = \\frac{c}{a} $, what is the value of $ c $ in terms of $ a $?\nStudent：$c = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} a$\nTeacher：Given $ c = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} a $ and $ c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $, what is the relationship between $ b $ and $ a $?\nStudent：$\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} a$\nTeacher：Squaring both sides, you get $ a^2 + b^2 = \\frac{5}{4}a^2 $. What does this imply about $ b^2 $ in terms of $ a^2 $?\nStudent：$b^2 = \\frac{1}{4} a^2$\nTeacher：Then $ b = \\frac{1}{2}a $, so the asymptotes are $ y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a}x = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}x $. Your answer C is incorrect. The correct answer is D.\nStudent：Okay, I see.\nTeacher：The error was in selecting option C, $ y = \\pm x $, instead of the correct asymptote equation derived as $ y = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}x $. The correct answer is D.\nStudent：zzc",
