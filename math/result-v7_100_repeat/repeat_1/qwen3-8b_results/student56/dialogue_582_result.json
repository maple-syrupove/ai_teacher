What is the domain of the cosine function?\nStudent：The domain of the cosine function is all real numbers.\nTeacher：The domain of the cosine function is indeed all real numbers, but this does not help us determine the specific value of $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\alpha$. What is the value of $\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$?\nStudent：The value is $\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$.\nTeacher：What is the approximate numerical value of $\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$?\nStudent：The approximate value is about $0.927$ radians.\nTeacher：What is the relationship between $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\alpha$ and $\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$?\nStudent：$\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\alpha = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\alpha$ in terms of $\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$?\nStudent：$\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\sin 2\\alpha$ in terms of $\\alpha$?\nStudent：$\\sin 2\\alpha = 2\\sin\\alpha \\cos\\alpha$\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\sin\\alpha$ and $\\cos\\alpha$ in terms of $\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$?\nStudent：$\\sin\\alpha = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right)$ and $\\cos\\alpha = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right)$.\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right)$?\nStudent：The value is $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right)$.\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right)$ using the cosine difference identity?\nStudent：Using the cosine difference identity: $\\cos(A-B) = \\cos A \\cos B + \\sin A \\sin B$. So \n$\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right) = \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\cos(\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)) + \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\sin(\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right))$.\nTeacher：You have not evaluated the expression numerically or simplified it further to find $\\sin 2\\alpha$. This is the key step you missed.\nStudent：Should I substitute the known values and compute the result explicitly?\nTeacher：Yes, you should substitute the known values and compute the result explicitly. This is where the error occurred.\nStudent：Okay, I will try substituting the values and computing explicitly this time.\nTeacher：You have not evaluated the expression numerically or simplified it further to find $\\sin 2\\alpha$. This is the key step you missed.\nStudent：Should I try converting $\\sin 2\\alpha$ into another form that uses $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha\\right)$ directly?\nTeacher：You have not computed the numerical value of $\\sin 2\\alpha$ using the derived expressions for $\\sin\\alpha$ and $\\cos\\alpha$. This is where the error occurred.\nStudent：Should I use the values I found for $\\sin\\alpha$ and $\\cos\\alpha$ to get the answer now?\nTeacher：Yes, you should now compute $\\sin 2\\alpha = 2\\sin\\alpha \\cos\\alpha$ using the derived expressions for $\\sin\\alpha$ and $\\cos\\alpha$. This is where the error occurred.\nStudent：Okay, I will use $2\\sin\\alpha \\cos\\alpha$ with my expressions and try to get the answer.\nTeacher：You have not simplified the final expression for $\\sin 2\\alpha$ to a numerical value. This is where the error occurred.\nStudent：Should I try writing out the whole calculation to simplify to a numerical value?\nTeacher：Yes, you should write out the full calculation and simplify to a numerical value. This is where the error occurred.\nStudent：Okay, I'll write out the full calculation and try to simplify it numerically.\nTeacher：You have not simplified the final expression for $\\sin 2\\alpha$ to a numerical value.
