    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I got $S = -\\frac{1}{6}$.\nTeacher：What is the formula for the area of a triangle formed by a line and the coordinate axes? How did you determine the intercepts of the tangent line?\nStudent：The formula I used is $S = \\frac{1}{2}ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are the $x$- and $y$-intercepts. I found the intercepts by setting $y=0$ and $x=0$ in the tangent line equation.\nTeacher：What is the sign of the area of a triangle formed by a line and the coordinate axes? Should the area be positive or negative?\nStudent：The area should be positive.\nTeacher：I see. How did you determine the sign of the intercepts when calculating the area? Did you consider the absolute values of the intercepts?\nStudent：I just used the numbers I got for $a$ and $b$, which were $1$ and $-\\frac{1}{3}$, without considering their absolute values.\nTeacher：You did not take the absolute values of the intercepts when calculating the area, which led to an incorrect sign.\nStudent：zzc",
