    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I don't know how to solve for $\\phi$ because the two functions are in different forms.\nTeacher：To solve for $\\phi$, you need to equate the phase shifts of the two functions after the shift. What is the phase shift of the original function $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$?\nStudent：The phase shift of $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ is $-\\frac{\\phi}{2}$.\nTeacher：You are correct about the phase shift of the original function. Now, what is the phase shift of the function $y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$?\nStudent：The phase shift of $y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ is $-\\frac{\\pi}{6}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the phase shifts. Now, consider the effect of shifting the original cosine function to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. How does this affect its phase shift?\nStudent：Shifting the graph to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ increases its phase shift by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so the new phase shift is $-\\frac{\\phi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated the new phase shift after the shift. Now, equate this to the phase shift of the sine function and solve for $\\phi$. What is the resulting equation?\nStudent：$-\\frac{\\phi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = -\\frac{\\pi}{6}$\nTeacher：Solving this equation gives $\\phi = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}$, which is outside the given range $-\\pi \\leqslant \\phi < \\pi$. This indicates an error in your calculation or reasoning. Have you considered the periodicity of the cosine function?\nStudent：I thought about the periodicity, but even considering it, I couldn't find a $\\phi$ in the required range.\nTeacher：You have not accounted for the fact that cosine and sine functions are co-functions, meaning $\\cos(\\theta) = \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. This relationship may help you reconcile the two expressions. Have you considered this identity?\nStudent：I didn't think about using that identity to connect cosine and sine in this problem.\nTeacher：You have not considered that the shift and the identity between sine and cosine might require adjusting the phase shift by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Have you tried incorporating this relationship into your equation?\nStudent：No, I didn't try incorporating this relationship into my equation.\nTeacher：You have not adjusted the phase shift equation to account for the co-function identity between sine and cosine. This is the key error in your reasoning.\nStudent：zzc",
