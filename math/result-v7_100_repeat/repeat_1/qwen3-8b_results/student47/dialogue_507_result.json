    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. [0,2]\nTeacher：Your answer includes all real numbers between 0 and 2, but the intersection of sets A and B should only include elements that are in both sets. Set A contains real numbers, while set B contains integers. Therefore, your answer is incorrect because it includes non-integer values.\nStudent：I thought since |x|≤2, the values between 0 and 2 are in A, and since √x≤4, that means x≤16, so I picked [0,2].\nTeacher：You correctly identified the range for set A and the condition for set B, but you failed to recognize that set B contains only integers.
