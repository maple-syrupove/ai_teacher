    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. 3\nTeacher：The eccentricity of a hyperbola is always greater than 1. Since option B is 3, which is greater than 1, it is a valid possibility. However, let's examine the relationship between the foci and the point on the hyperbola to determine if this answer is correct. What is the distance between the two foci?\nStudent：The distance between the two foci is $|(0,4)-(0,-4)|=8$.\nTeacher：The distance between the foci is 8, so the focal length $2c = 8$, which means $c = 4$. For a hyperbola, the eccentricity $e = \\frac{c}{a}$. To find $e$, we need to determine the value of $a$. What is the definition of a hyperbola in terms of distances from the foci?\nStudent：The definition is that for any point on the hyperbola, the absolute value of the difference of its distances to the two foci is equal to $2a$.\nTeacher：For the point $(-6, 4)$ on the hyperbola, calculate the distance to each focus and find the absolute difference. What is the distance from $(-6, 4)$ to $(0, 4)$?\nStudent：The distance from $(-6, 4)$ to $(0, 4)$ is $| -6 - 0 | = 6$.\nTeacher：The distance from $(-6, 4)$ to $(0, 4)$ is indeed 6. Now, what is the distance from $(-6, 4)$ to $(0, -4)$?\nStudent：The distance is $\\sqrt{(-6-0)^2 + (4-(-4))^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 64} = 10$.\nTeacher：The absolute difference between the distances is $|10 - 6| = 4$, so $2a = 4$, which means $a = 2$. Since $c = 4$, the eccentricity $e = \\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$. Your answer of 3 is incorrect. The correct answer is C.\nStudent：Oh, I see. Thank you for the explanation.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the answer as B. 3, but the correct answer is C. 2. Your mistake was in assuming the eccentricity could be directly determined without calculating $a$ and $c$. The correct answer is C. 2.\nStudent：zzc",
