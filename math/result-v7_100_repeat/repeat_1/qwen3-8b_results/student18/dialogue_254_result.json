    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose C. The graph of $f(x)$ is symmetric with respect to the line $x = \\pi$.\nTeacher：What happens when you substitute $x = 2\\pi - \\theta$ into $f(x)$?\nStudent：When I substitute $x = 2\\pi - \\theta$, I get:\n$$f(2\\pi - \\theta) = \\sin(2\\pi - \\theta) + \\frac{1}{\\sin(2\\pi - \\theta)} = -\\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}.$$\nTeacher：What is the relationship between $f(2\\pi - \\theta)$ and $f(\\theta)$?\nStudent：$f(2\\pi - \\theta) = -f(\\theta)$.\nTeacher：What does this imply about the symmetry of $f(x)$ with respect to $x = \\pi$?\nStudent：It means the function is antisymmetric with respect to $x = \\pi$, not symmetric.\nTeacher：Therefore, the graph of $f(x)$ is not symmetric with respect to the line $x = \\pi$.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：I see.

What about the symmetry with respect to the line $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$?\nStudent：I just checked: $f(\\pi - x) = f(x)$, so the function is symmetric with respect to $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $f(\\pi - x) = f(x)$, which implies symmetry about the line $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.
