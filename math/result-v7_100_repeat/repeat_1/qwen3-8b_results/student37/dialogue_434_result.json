    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Cannot be determined.\nTeacher：The problem provides sufficient information to determine $ t $. What assumption are you making that leads you to conclude it cannot be determined?\nStudent：I thought that because $t$ was in both terms after expanding $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}$, and I didn't know $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$, I couldn't solve for $t$.\nTeacher：You know the angle between $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$, so you can determine $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$. What value did you use for it?\nStudent：I didn't assign a value to $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$; I just left it as is.\nTeacher：You have the angle between $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$, so you can compute $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$. What is the value of $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$ given the angle of $60^\\circ$?\nStudent：$\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = \\cos 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：You now have all the necessary information to compute $ t $. What step did you skip after finding $ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $?\nStudent：I didn't substitute $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = \\frac{1}{2}$ into the equation and solve for $t$.\nTeacher：You have not performed the algebraic manipulation to solve for $ t $ after substituting $ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = \\frac{1}{2} $.
