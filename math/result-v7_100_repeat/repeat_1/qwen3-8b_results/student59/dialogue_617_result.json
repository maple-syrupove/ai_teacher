    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：D\nTeacher：What is the relationship between vectors $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AB}, \\overrightarrow{AC}$? How did you determine the coefficients in your answer?\nStudent：I used that $E$ is the midpoint, so I thought to write $EB$ as a linear combination of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$ and picked coefficients accordingly.\nTeacher：What is the position of point $D$ relative to side $BC$, and how does this affect the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$?\nStudent：Point $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, so $AD$ is the median. I thought that would help express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ using $AB$ and $AC$.\nTeacher：What is the vector $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$? How does this relate to $\\overrightarrow{AE}$?\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{AD} = \\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC}$, so $\\overrightarrow{AE} = \\frac{1}{2} \\overrightarrow{AD} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})$.\nTeacher：What is the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AE}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AB}$? How did you arrive at your final answer?\nStudent：I wrote $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\overrightarrow{AE}$, then substituted $\\overrightarrow{AE}$ and simplified to get the coefficients I used in my answer.\nTeacher：You assumed $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\overrightarrow{AE}$, but this is incorrect. The correct relationship involves vector addition, not subtraction. What is the correct expression for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AE}$?\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{EA} + \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：You have now correctly identified the relationship between $\\overrightarrow{EB}$, $\\overrightarrow{EA}$, and $\\overrightarrow{AB}$. However, your final answer still does not match the correct expression. What is the error in your calculation when substituting $\\overrightarrow{AE}$ into $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{EA} + \\overrightarrow{AB}$?\nStudent：I may have incorrectly used the direction of $\\overrightarrow{EA}$, perhaps substituting it incorrectly.\nTeacher：You have not correctly accounted for the direction of $\\overrightarrow{EA}$ when substituting into the expression for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. What is the relationship between $\\overrightarrow{EA}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AE}$?\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{EA} = -\\overrightarrow{AE}$, so the direction is reversed compared to $\\overrightarrow{AE}$.\nTeacher：You have now correctly identified the relationship between $\\overrightarrow{EA}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AE}$. What is the correct expression for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ after substituting $\\overrightarrow{AE}$?\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{EB} = -\\overrightarrow{AE} + \\overrightarrow{AB} = \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})$.\nTeacher：You have now correctly substituted $\\overrightarrow{AE}$ into the expression for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. What is the final simplified form of this expression?\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{2} \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{2} \\overrightarrow{AC} = \\frac{1}{2} \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{2} \\overrightarrow{AC}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the expression, but this result does not match any of the given options. What is the error in your calculation when simplifying $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\frac{1}{2} \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{2} \\overrightarrow{AC}$?\nStudent：I think I may have missed a step involving the correct location of $E$ or how to express $AD$ properly when substituting.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the expression, but your initial assumption about $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ was incorrect. What is the correct expression for $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$?\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{AD} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})$\nTeacher：You incorrectly expressed $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ as $\\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})$, but the correct expression is $\\overrightarrow{AD} = \\overrightarrow{AB} + \\frac{1}{2}\\overrightarrow{AC}$. This error propagated through your subsequent calculations.\nStudent：zzc",
