    "question": "23. (10 points) In the Cartesian coordinate system $xOy$, the parametric equation of curve $C_1$ is $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}x=t \\cos \\alpha \\\\ y=t \\sin \\alpha\\end{array}\\right.$ (where $t$ is a non-zero parameter), and $0 \\leqslant \\alpha \\leqslant \\pi$. In a polar coordinate system with O as the pole and the positive x-axis as the polar axis, the equations of curve $C_2$ and $C_3$ are $\\rho=2 \\sin \\theta$ and $\\rho=2 \\sqrt{3} \\cos \\theta$ respectively.\n\n(1) Find the Cartesian coordinates of the intersection points of $C_2$ and $C_3$.\n\n(2) If $C_1$ intersects $C_2$ at point A and $C_1$ intersects $C_3$ at point B, find the maximum value of $|AB|$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution: (1) First, convert the polar equations of $C_2$ and $C_3$ to Cartesian equations.\nFor $C_2: \\rho = 2\\sin\\theta$. Multiply by $\\rho$: $\\rho^2 = 2\\rho\\sin\\theta$. Using $x^2+y^2=\\rho^2$ and $y=\\rho\\sin\\theta$, we get $x^2+y^2=2y$, which is $x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$. This is a circle centered at $(0,1)$ with radius 1.\nFor $C_3: \\rho = 2\\sqrt{3}\\cos\\theta$. Multiply by $\\rho$: $\\rho^2 = 2\\sqrt{3}\\rho\\cos\\theta$. Using $x=\\rho\\cos\\theta$, we get $x^2+y^2=2\\sqrt{3}x$, which is $(x-\\sqrt{3})^2 + y^2 = 3$. This is a circle centered at $(\\sqrt{3},0)$ with radius $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nTo find the intersection points, we solve the system:\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}x^2+y^2-2y=0 \\\\ x^2+y^2-2\\sqrt{3}x=0\\end{array}\\right.$\nFrom the equations, we can equate $2y = 2\\sqrt{3}x$, which gives $y=\\sqrt{3}x$.\nSubstitute this into the first equation: $x^2 + (\\sqrt{3}x)^2 - 2(\\sqrt{3}x) = 0$.\n$x^2 + 3x^2 - 2\\sqrt{3}x = 0 \\implies 4x^2 - 2\\sqrt{3}x = 0 \\implies 2x(2x - \\sqrt{3}) = 0$.\nThis gives two solutions for x: $x=0$ or $x=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nIf $x=0$, then $y=\\sqrt{3}(0)=0$. The intersection point is $(0,0)$.\nIf $x=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, then $y=\\sqrt{3}(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})=\\frac{3}{2}$. The intersection point is $(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac{3}{2})$.\nThe intersection points are $(0,0)$ and $(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac{3}{2})$.\n\n(2) The curve $C_1$ is a line passing through the origin. Its parametric equation $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}x=t \\cos \\alpha \\\\ y=t \\sin \\alpha\\end{array}\\right.$ represents a ray from the origin with angle $\\alpha$. Since $t$ can be positive or negative ($t\\neq 0$), it represents the entire line through the origin with angle $\\alpha$. The polar equation for this line is simply $\\theta = \\alpha$.\n\nPoint A is the intersection of the line $C_1$ ($\\theta=\\alpha$) and the circle $C_2$ ($\rho=2\\sin\\theta$). The intersection point (other than the origin) has polar coordinates $(\rho_A, \\theta_A) = (2\\sin\\alpha, \\alpha)$.\nPoint B is the intersection of the line $C_1$ ($\\theta=\\alpha$) and the circle $C_3$ ($\rho=2\\sqrt{3}\\cos\\theta$). The intersection point (other than the origin) has polar coordinates $(\rho_B, \\theta_B) = (2\\sqrt{3}\\cos\\alpha, \\alpha)$.\n\nSince points A and B lie on the same line through the origin ($\\theta=\\alpha$), the distance between them is the absolute difference of their radial coordinates:\n$|AB| = |\\rho_A - \\rho_B| = |2\\sin\\alpha - 2\\sqrt{3}\\cos\\alpha|$.\n\nTo find the maximum value of this expression, we use the R-formula: $a\\sin x + b\\cos x = R\\sin(x+\\phi)$.\n$|AB| = 2|\\sin\\alpha - \\sqrt{3}\\cos\\alpha|$.\nLet's find the maximum of $\\sin\\alpha - \\sqrt{3}\\cos\\alpha$. Here $R = \\sqrt{1^2+(-\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{1+3}=2$.\nSo, $\\sin\\alpha - \\sqrt{3}\\cos\\alpha = 2(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\alpha - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos\\alpha) = 2(\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\cos\\alpha\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = 2\\sin(\\alpha-\\frac{\\pi}{3})$.\n\nTherefore, $|AB| = |2 \\cdot 2\\sin(\\alpha-\\frac{\\pi}{3})| = 4|\\sin(\\alpha-\\frac{\\pi}{3})|$.\nThe maximum value of $|\\sin(\\alpha-\\frac{\\pi}{3})|$ is 1. This occurs when $\\alpha-\\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ or $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, etc.\nFor example, if $\\alpha-\\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, then $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$. This value of $\\alpha$ is within the given range $[0, \\pi]$.\n\nThe maximum value of $|AB|$ is $4 \\times 1 = 4$.",
