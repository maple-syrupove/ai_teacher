    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$m = \\frac{1}{2}$\nTeacher：The asymptotes of the hyperbola are $y = \\pm \\frac{x}{m}$. What is the condition for a line to be tangent to a circle?\nStudent：A line is tangent to a circle if the distance from the center of the circle to the line is equal to the radius.\nTeacher：The circle equation can be rewritten in standard form. What is the center and radius of the circle $x^2 + y^2 - 4y + 3 = 0$?\nStudent：The center is at (0, 0) and the radius is $\\sqrt{3}$.\nTeacher：The center of the circle is at (0, 2) and the radius is 1. What is the distance from the center (0, 2) to the line $y = \\frac{x}{m}$?\nStudent：The distance is $\\frac{|2|}{\\sqrt{1+(\\frac{1}{m})^2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{m^2}}}$.\nTeacher：The distance formula is correct, but you have not simplified it properly. What is the simplified form of $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{m^2}}}$?\nStudent：$\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{m^2}}} = \\frac{2m}{\\sqrt{m^2+1}}$\nTeacher：The distance from the center to the line must equal the radius, which is 1. What equation do you get when you set $\\frac{2m}{\\sqrt{m^2+1}} = 1$?\nStudent：We get $2m = \\sqrt{m^2+1}$.\nTeacher：Squaring both sides, you get $4m^2 = m^2 + 1$. Solving this gives $3m^2 = 1$, so $m^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$, and since $m > 0$, $m = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Your answer of $\\frac{1}{2}$ is incorrect.\nStudent：Okay.\nTeacher：The error is in the calculation of the center and radius of the circle. The center is at (0, 2) and the radius is 1, not (0, 0) and $\\sqrt{3}$.\nStudent：zzc",
