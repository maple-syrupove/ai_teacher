    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D.\nTeacher：The condition in D states that two planes are perpendicular to the same plane. However, this does not guarantee that the planes themselves are parallel. What is the relationship between planes that are perpendicular to the same plane?\nStudent：If two planes are both perpendicular to the same plane, they can be parallel, but they can also intersect.\nTeacher：You are correct that planes perpendicular to the same plane can either be parallel or intersect. Therefore, the condition in D is not sufficient for $\\alpha // \\beta$. What do you think about the condition in B?\nStudent：Condition B says there are two intersecting lines in $\\alpha$ that are parallel to $\\beta$. If those lines are parallel to $\\beta$, then the entire plane $\\alpha$ is parallel to $\\beta$. So B looks like a stronger condition than D.\nTeacher：You are correct that B implies $\\alpha // \\beta$. However, the question asks for the *necessary and sufficient* condition. Is there a condition that is both necessary and sufficient?\nStudent：I think condition B is both necessary and sufficient because if two intersecting lines in α are parallel to β, then α must be parallel to β, and vice versa.\nTeacher：You are correct that B implies $\\alpha // \\beta$. However, is it *necessary* for two intersecting lines in $\\alpha$ to be parallel to $\\beta$ if $\\alpha // \\beta$?\nStudent：If $\\alpha$ is parallel to $\\beta$, then every line in $\\alpha$ is either parallel to $\\beta$ or lies in $\\beta$. So, there should definitely be two intersecting lines in $\\alpha$ that are parallel to $\\beta$.\nTeacher：You are correct that if $\\alpha // \\beta$, then there are two intersecting lines in $\\alpha$ that are parallel to $\\beta$. Therefore, condition B is both necessary and sufficient. The error lies in your initial choice of D, which is not sufficient.\nStudent：zzc",
