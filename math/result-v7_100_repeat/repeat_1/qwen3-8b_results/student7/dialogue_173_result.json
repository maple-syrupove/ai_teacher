    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. $A \\cap B=\\varnothing$\nTeacher：What is the solution set for set $B$?\nStudent：For set $B$, the condition is $3-2x>0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x<\\dfrac{3}{2}$. So $B=\\{x \\mid x<\\dfrac{3}{2}\\}$.\nTeacher：What is the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$?\nStudent：The intersection is $A \\cap B = \\{x \\mid x<2\\} \\cap \\{x \\mid x<\\dfrac{3}{2}\\}$.\nTeacher：The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are in both. What is the overlap between $x < 2$ and $x < \\frac{3}{2}$?\nStudent：The overlap would be the values of $x$ that satisfy both $x<2$ and $x<\\frac{3}{2}$, which is $x<\\frac{3}{2}$.\nTeacher：A. $A \\cap B = \\left\\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2}\\right\\}$ is correct.\nStudent：I see, thank you.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the intersection and the solution set for set $B$.
