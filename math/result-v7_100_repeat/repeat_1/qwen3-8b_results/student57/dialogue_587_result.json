    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. $\\frac{9 \\pi}{2}$\nTeacher：What is the formula for the volume of a sphere? How did you use it in your calculation?\nStudent：The formula I used is \\( V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\). I plugged in the value \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\) for the radius.\nTeacher：What is the relationship between the sphere and the prism? How did you determine the radius of the sphere?\nStudent：I thought the sphere just touched the top and bottom faces of the prism, so I set the radius as half the height of the prism, that is, \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\nTeacher：What is the maximum possible radius of a sphere that can fit inside a triangular prism? How does the shape of the prism affect this radius?\nStudent：I think the maximum radius is limited by the smallest distance from the sphere's center to the prism's faces, so I considered the height and used half of it. I didn't consider how the triangular base might constrain the radius.\nTeacher：The maximum radius is not only limited by the height but also by the inradius of the triangular base. You did not account for this constraint.\nStudent：zzc",
