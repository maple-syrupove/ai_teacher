    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option C, $c < a < b$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes $a = \\log_2 0.2$ is greater than $c = 0.2^{0.3}$, but you have not justified this comparison properly. Can you explain how you determined the relationship between $a$ and $c$?\nStudent：I just thought that since $a$ is a logarithm and $c$ is a power, maybe $a$ would be bigger. I didn't do any transformation.\nTeacher：Your assumption about the relationship between $a$ and $c$ is based on intuition rather than proper mathematical analysis. Can you explain how you compared $a = \\log_2 0.2$ and $c = 0.2^{0.3}$?\nStudent：I didn’t compare them algebraically. I just guessed based on their forms, thinking $a$ might be bigger than $c$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning is flawed because you are comparing $a = \\log_2 0.2$ and $c = 0.2^{0.3}$ based on their forms without proper analysis. Can you explain how you determined the sign of $a$?\nStudent：The sign of $a$ is negative because $0.2$ is less than $1$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $a = \\log_2 0.2$ is negative, but this does not necessarily mean it is greater than $c = 0.2^{0.3}$. Can you explain how you determined the relative size of $a$ and $c$?\nStudent：I didn't actually determine their relative size; I just made a guess based on how they looked, instead of transforming or calculating them.\nTeacher：Your mistake is that you did not properly analyze the numerical values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ to determine their relative sizes. Instead, you relied on intuition without performing any calculations or transformations.\nStudent：zzc",
