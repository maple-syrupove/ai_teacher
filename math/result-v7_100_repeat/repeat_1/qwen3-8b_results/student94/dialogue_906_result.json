    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried $x=2$, $y=0$, then $z=2-0=2$. So the minimum value is $2$.\nTeacher：Your assumption that $x=2$, $y=0$ satisfies all the constraints is incorrect. Let's check if this point meets all three inequalities.\nStudent：For $x=2$, $y=0$:\nFirst inequality: $4(2)-3(0)-3=8-0-3=5\\geq0$ ✔️\nSecond: $2-2(0)-2=2-0-2=0\\leq0$ ✔️\nThird: $2(2)+6(0)-9=4+0-9=-5\\leq0$ ✔️\n\nSo all constraints are satisfied.\nTeacher：Your calculation shows that $x=2$, $y=0$ satisfies all constraints, but this point does not yield the minimum value of $z=x-5y$. You have not considered other points within the feasible region. Let's explore if there are other boundary points that could yield a lower value.\nStudent：I tried a random boundary point: for $x=0$, $y=1$, $z=0-5(1)=-5$. So maybe $-5$ is lower.\nTeacher：Your assumption that $x=0$, $y=1$ satisfies all the constraints is incorrect. Let's check if this point meets all three inequalities.\nStudent：For $x=0$, $y=1$:\n\nFirst inequality: $4(0)-3(1)-3=0-3-3=-6\\not\\geq0$ ❌\n\nSo it doesn't satisfy the first constraint.\nTeacher：Your mistake is assuming that $x=0$, $y=1$ satisfies the first constraint. You need to verify all constraints before considering a point as feasible. Let's check the second and third constraints as well.\nStudent：Second constraint: $0-2(1)-2 = 0-2-2 = -4 \\leq 0$ ✔️  \nThird: $2(0)+6(1)-9 = 0+6-9 = -3 \\leq 0$ ✔️  \nBut since it fails the first, it's not feasible.\nTeacher：Your mistake is selecting points without systematically analyzing the feasible region defined by the constraints. You need to identify the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate $z=x-5y$ at those points to find the minimum value.\nStudent：zzc",
