    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: I wasn't able to find a specific value for $M+m$ because I got stuck when differentiating $f(x)$.\nTeacher：What did you obtain for the derivative of the numerator and denominator?\nStudent：For the numerator $(x+1)^{2} + \\sin x$, the derivative is $2(x+1) + \\cos x$.  \nFor the denominator $x^{2} + 1$, the derivative is $2x$.\nTeacher：You correctly computed the derivatives of the numerator and denominator. What did you do next with these derivatives?\nStudent：Next, I applied the quotient rule to find $f'(x)$, but the resulting expression became quite complex and unwieldy, making it difficult for me to proceed further.\nTeacher：You correctly applied the quotient rule, but you failed to simplify the resulting expression before attempting to find critical points.
