What is the upper bound of set $M$?\nStudent：The upper bound of set $M$ is 1, but 1 is not included in $M$ because the interval is open at 1.\nTeacher：Your answer includes 1, which is not in $M$. What elements of $N$ are strictly greater than $-3$ and strictly less than $1$?\nStudent：The elements of $N$ that are strictly greater than $-3$ and strictly less than $1$ are $-2$, $-1$, and $0$.\nTeacher：Your answer includes 1, which is not in $M$.
