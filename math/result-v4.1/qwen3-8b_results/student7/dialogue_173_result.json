    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My incorrect answer was B.\nTeacher：What is the solution set for set B?\nStudent：Set B is $\\{x \\mid 3-2x > 0\\}$. Solving $3-2x>0$ gives $x < \\frac{3}{2}$. So, $B=\\{x \\mid x<\\frac{3}{2}\\}$.\nTeacher：What is the relationship between sets A and B based on their solution sets?\nStudent：Set $A$ is all $x$ less than $2$, and set $B$ is all $x$ less than $\\frac{3}{2}$. So, set $B$ is a subset of set $A$.\nTeacher：Then, what is $A \\cap B$?\nStudent：$A \\cap B$ should be $\\{x \\mid x<\\frac{3}{2}\\}$.\nTeacher：A. $A \\cap B = \\left\\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2}\\right\\}$ is correct, so your answer B was incorrect due to misunderstanding the intersection.\nStudent：zzc",
