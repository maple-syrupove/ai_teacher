    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer was: $\\phi$ cannot be solved.\n教师：What happens to the phase angle ($\\phi$) when the cosine function is shifted to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units and coincides with the sine function?\n学生：If the cosine graph shifts right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, its phase becomes $2x + \\phi + 2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2x + \\phi + \\pi$.\n教师：What should be the phase angle for the cosine function after it's shifted to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to match the sine function's graph?\n学生：After shifting right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the phase of the cosine function should satisfy $2x + \\phi + \\pi = 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n教师：What can be deduced when you equate $2x + \\phi + \\pi$ to $2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ for the shifted cosine and the sine function?\n学生：When we equate them, we get: $\\phi + \\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, so $\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\pi = -\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\n教师：What misconception did you encounter when equating $\\phi + \\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ to find the value of $\\phi$ in this problem?\n学生：I assumed that the shifted cosine function could be equated directly to the sine function without first converting one function into the other's form, so I didn't transform $\\cos$ into $\\sin$ or vice versa.\n教师：You are close to the error. Think more carefully about the relationship between the cosine and sine functions and how they are related by shifting the graph to the right. What adjustment needs to be made before equating them?\n学生：I should have used the identity $\\sin \\theta = \\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ to convert the sine function into a cosine form before equating the arguments.\n教师：Exactly, you should have used the identity $\\sin \\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ to convert the sine function into a cosine form before equating the arguments.
