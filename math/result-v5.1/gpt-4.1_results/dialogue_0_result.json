    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer is: I was unable to calculate an exact value for $M+m$; I tried to differentiate $f(x)$ directly but got stuck.\n教师：Did you check whether $f(x)$ has any symmetry or if it reaches its extremum values at specific, easily testable points like $x=0$ or $x=\\pi$ before differentiating?\n学生：No, I didn't check for symmetry or test those specific points first. I started differentiating right away.\n教师：Thank you for your response. Your mistake is proceeding to differentiate without first exploring the function's symmetry or evaluating it at simple, notable points, which can often reveal maximum or minimum values more directly.\n学生：That’s not exactly where I made my main mistake. I struggled more with transforming the function into a simpler form, which led to calculation errors.\n教师：Thank you for clarifying. Did you attempt to simplify $(x+1)^2+\\sin x$ directly, or did you possibly make a mistake when combining this part with the denominator $x^2+1$?\n学生：I initially tried to work with the numerator directly without transforming the entire expression. I did not attempt to combine or simplify $(x+1)^2+\\sin x$ over $x^2+1$ into a new form.\n教师：Thank you for your explanation. Your error lies in not simplifying the complete expression $\\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ before analyzing its properties.\n学生：zzc",
