    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer is D, $[1,+\\infty)$.\n教师：Let’s examine your reasoning: What condition must the derivative of an increasing function satisfy on its interval?\n学生：The derivative must be greater than or equal to zero for all $x$ in the interval, so $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x > 1$.\n教师：For $f(x)=kx-\\ln x$, what is $f'(x)$? Can you state the derivative and the resulting inequality you set up for $x>1$?\n学生：The derivative is $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}$. So I set up the inequality $k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0$ for $x > 1$.\n教师：You made an error with the direction of the inequality when solving for $k$; please check that step carefully.\n学生：I thought $k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0$ meant $k \\geq \\frac{1}{x}$ for any $x > 1$, so I just said $k > 0$.\n教师：The error lies in concluding \"$k > 0$\" from \"$k \\geq \\frac{1}{x}$ for all $x > 1$\"; this overlooks how $\\frac{1}{x}$ behaves as $x$ increases.\n学生：I see. I didn't consider how $\\frac{1}{x}$ changes as $x$ increases; I just quickly set $k > 0$ without analyzing the range of $\\frac{1}{x}$.\n教师：That’s correct—your error was in not analyzing the minimum value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ for $x > 1$, which is crucial for determining $k$.\n学生：zzc",
