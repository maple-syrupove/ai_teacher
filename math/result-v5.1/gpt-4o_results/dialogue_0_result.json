    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer was: I couldn't calculate the exact values for $M$ and $m$, so I left the answer blank.\n教师：What approach did you use to try to find the maximum and minimum values of the function?\n学生：I tried to differentiate the original function $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^{2}+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$ to find its critical points and thus find the extrema.\n教师：What did you do after differentiating the function?\n学生：After differentiating, I attempted to solve the resulting equation for the critical points, but the calculations became complicated and I got stuck in the process.\n教师：When you differentiate the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} \\), did you ensure that you applied the quotient rule correctly? Remember that simplifying the derivative is key before setting it to zero to find critical points.\n学生：I did use the quotient rule, but after simplifying, the derivative still looked very messy. I wasn't able to further simplify it effectively, so I couldn't solve for the critical points.\n教师：In your process, after applying the quotient rule, it might be possible that you got stuck on calculating the derivative correctly or simplifying it efficiently. Double-check the simplification and ensure each term is correctly handled.\n学生：I checked my simplification and the terms, but even after carefully going through each step, the resulting equation for the derivative was still quite complicated, and I couldn't see a clear way to solve it for the critical points.\n教师：What strategy did you consider for testing endpoints or intuitive values to estimate possible maxima or minima?\n学生：I considered plugging in a few simple values like $x=0$ and $x=1$ to estimate, but I didn't have a systematic strategy for testing key points or endpoints.\n教师：When estimating maxima and minima by testing values, it's important to consider critical points derived from the derivative and test them against endpoints or specific values that influence the function's behavior. Your approach lacked systematic evaluation at key intervals or using known trigonometric value ranges. Focus on analyzing how sinusoidal patterns might impact denominator growth.\n学生：I see. I’ll work on evaluating more values methodically and better analyze how $\\sin x$ interacts with the denominator, especially at points where its effect is maximized or minimized. Thank you for pointing this out.\n教师：It seems that you did not calculate critical points correctly or analyze the derivative thoroughly after applying the quotient rule. Re-evaluate your simplification process.\n学生：That’s true, after differentiating, my simplification process was insufficient and I didn’t find any explicit critical points, so I couldn’t provide $M+m$.\n教师：It appears the main issue was in effectively simplifying and solving the derivative after applying the quotient rule.\n学生：zzc",
