If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly.

After making this definitive statement, wait for the student's final response. If the student does not reply with \"zzc,\" you should then begin a new line of questioning in the next turn, but do not repeat the same diagnosis.\n**The prompt history contains past dialogues.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose D.\nTeacher：What is the definition of an odd function?\nStudent：An odd function satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：What happens to $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ when you replace $x$ with $-x$?\nStudent：When I replace $x$ with $-x$, I get $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$.\nTeacher：Since $f(x)$ is odd, $f(-x) = -f(x)$. Since $g(x)$ is even, $g(-x) = g(x)$. Therefore, $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |(-f(x)) \\cdot g(x)| = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$. This shows that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is even, not odd. Thus, D is incorrect.\nStudent：Oh, I see.\nTeacher：C. $f(x) \\bullet|g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nStudent：Let me check: $f(-x)\\cdot|g(-x)| = -f(x)\\cdot|g(x)| = -[f(x)\\cdot|g(x)|]$. So this is odd.\nTeacher：C is correct. The student's reasoning for option C is accurate.\nStudent：Teacher, do you have any other questions?\nTeacher：I have no further questions. zzc.\nStudent：zzc",
