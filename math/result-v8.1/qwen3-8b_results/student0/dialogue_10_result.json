    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by directly differentiating $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^{2}+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$ and setting the derivative to zero, but my calculation got too complicated and I couldn’t finish.\nTeacher：What did you do with the derivative once you found it?\nStudent：I tried to simplify the derivative and solve for $x$ where the derivative equals zero, but the expressions were too complex, so I wasn’t able to solve for specific $x$ values.\nTeacher：What did you observe about the behavior of the function $ f(x) $ as $ x \\to \\infty $ and $ x \\to -\\infty $?\nStudent：As $x \\to \\infty$ or $x \\to -\\infty$, I observed that $f(x)$ approaches $1$ because the leading terms in the numerator and denominator both grow like $x^2$.\nTeacher：What did you do with the numerator and denominator when analyzing the limit as $x \\to \\infty$ or $x \\to -\\infty$?\nStudent：I compared the degrees of $x$ in the numerator and denominator, noticing that both had $x^2$ as the highest power, so the function approaches $1$ at infinity.\nTeacher：You assumed the function approaches 1 at infinity, but you did not consider the oscillatory behavior of $\\sin x$ in the numerator, which affects the limit.\nStudent：I focused mainly on the $x^2$ terms and considered $\\sin x$ negligible at infinity, so I didn't analyze its effect in detail.\nTeacher：You neglected the oscillatory nature of $\\sin x$ in the numerator, which prevents the limit as $x \\to \\infty$ or $x \\to -\\infty$ from being a constant value.\nStudent：I thought since $x^2$ dominates, the $\\sin x$ term would be very small as $x$ gets large, so I ignored its influence in the limit.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that $\\sin x$ becomes negligible as $x \\to \\infty$, but its oscillatory nature prevents the function from approaching a single limit.\nStudent：I see, but I thought since the denominator grows faster, the overall effect of $\\sin x$ would vanish as $x$ increases.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assume that the oscillatory behavior of $\\sin x$ becomes negligible in the limit as $x \\to \\infty$, when in fact it does not.\nStudent：zzc",
