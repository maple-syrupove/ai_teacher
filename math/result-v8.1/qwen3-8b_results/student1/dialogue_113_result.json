If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly.

After making this definitive statement, wait for the student's final response. If the student does not reply with \"zzc,\" you should then begin a new line of questioning in the next turn, but do not repeat the same diagnosis.\n**The prompt history contains past dialogues. Strictly avoid mimicking the student's tone or restating their answers for analysis.
