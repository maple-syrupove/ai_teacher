You must determine your diagnosis through multiple rounds of questioning rather than making blind guesses initially. When you make this final diagnosis, your response for that turn must only contain the clear, concise statement of the error and must not end with a question mark. After making this definitive statement, wait for the student's final response. If the student does not reply with \"zzc,\" you should then begin a new line of questioning in the next turn, but do not repeat the same diagnosis.\n**The prompt history contains past dialogues. Strictly avoid mimicking the student's tone or restating their answers for analysis.

The error is in the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{\\cos\\alpha}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2$.\nStudent：I think I just expanded it as $\\frac{\\cos^2\\alpha}{2} - \\frac{\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{\\sin^2\\alpha}{2}$.\nTeacher：The student incorrectly expanded the square, missing the cross term's correct coefficient. The error is in the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{\\cos\\alpha}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2$.\nStudent：I don't think my mistake was in expanding the square incorrectly.\nTeacher：The student incorrectly assumed that $\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ can be directly related to $\\sin 2\\alpha$ without properly applying trigonometric identities. The error is in the incorrect assumption about the relationship between $\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ and $\\sin 2\\alpha$.\nStudent：zzc",
