    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：Why do you think $\\phi$ cannot be solved? Is there a relationship between the cosine and sine functions that might help here?\nStudent：I think because the forms are different—one is cosine and one is sine—so I can't set them equal. I didn't recall a relationship that could convert one to match the other.\nTeacher：Is there a phase shift identity that relates sine and cosine? For example, can you express $\\sin(\\theta)$ in terms of $\\cos(\\theta + \\phi)$ for some $\\phi$?\nStudent：Yes, there is an identity: $\\sin \\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nTeacher：Good. So you know that $\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. Let's consider the function $y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$. Can you rewrite this using the identity you just mentioned?\nStudent：$\\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nTeacher：That is correct. Now, consider the original function $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ shifted to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. What does this shift do to the argument of the cosine function?\nStudent：Shifting to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ changes the function to $y = \\cos\\left(2x + \\phi - 2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of the phase shift is incorrect. Shifting a function $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ requires replacing $x$ with $x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, not subtracting $2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ from the argument.\nStudent：Oh, I see. So, I should have substituted $x$ with $x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ in the argument.\nTeacher：You incorrectly adjusted the phase shift by multiplying the shift amount by the coefficient of $x$ instead of applying the shift directly to $x$ in the argument.\nStudent：zzc",
