    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by directly differentiating $f(x)$, but the calculation got very messy and I couldn't proceed. I wasn't able to give a value for $M + m$.\nTeacher：Did you consider simplifying the function before differentiating?\nStudent：No, I didn't try to simplify the function first. I started differentiating the original expression right away.\nTeacher：What did you do after differentiating the original expression? Did you attempt to solve for critical points?\nStudent：Yes, after differentiating, I tried to set the derivative equal to zero to solve for critical points, but the resulting equation was complicated and I couldn't solve it.\nTeacher：Did you consider analyzing the function's behavior or symmetry to simplify the process?\nStudent：No, I focused only on the derivative and didn't look for function behavior or symmetry.\nTeacher：Did you consider splitting the function into simpler parts before taking the derivative?\nStudent：No, I didn't try to split or transform the function into simpler parts before differentiating.\nTeacher：Did you analyze the function for periodicity or any properties that could simplify finding extrema?\nStudent：No, I didn't analyze the function for periodicity or any special properties before attempting to find the extrema.\nTeacher：Did you consider evaluating the function at specific points, such as $ x = 0 $, to get a sense of its behavior?\nStudent：No, I didn't try evaluating the function at specific points like $x=0$.\nTeacher：Did you consider that the function might have symmetry or other properties that could simplify finding $M + m$?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider that the function might have symmetry or special properties to simplify finding $M + m$.\nTeacher：You did not consider simplifying the function or analyzing its structure before attempting to find extrema, which led to unnecessary complexity in differentiation.\nStudent：zzc",
