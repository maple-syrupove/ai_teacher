    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: k > 0.\nTeacher：What is the condition for a function to be monotonically increasing?\nStudent：A function is monotonically increasing if its derivative is greater than or equal to zero on the interval.\nTeacher：What is the derivative of $ f(x) = kx - \\ln x $?\nStudent：The derivative is $f'(x) = k - \\dfrac{1}{x}$.\nTeacher：To ensure $ f(x) $ is monotonically increasing on $ (1, +\\infty) $, $ f'(x) \\geq 0 $ must hold for all $ x > 1 $. What is the minimum value of $ \\dfrac{1}{x} $ on this interval?\nStudent：The minimum value of $\\dfrac{1}{x}$ for $x > 1$ is $0$, as $x$ approaches infinity.\nTeacher：That is incorrect. The minimum value of $ \\dfrac{1}{x} $ on $ (1, +\\infty) $ is not $ 0 $. What is the maximum value of $ \\dfrac{1}{x} $ on this interval?\nStudent：The maximum value of $\\dfrac{1}{x}$ for $x > 1$ is $1$, when $x$ approaches $1$ from the right.\nTeacher：The minimum value of $ \\dfrac{1}{x} $ on $ (1, +\\infty) $ is not $ 0 $. What is the maximum value of $ \\dfrac{1}{x} $ on this interval?\nStudent：The maximum value of $\\dfrac{1}{x}$ on $(1, +\\infty)$ is $1$ when $x$ approaches $1$ from the right.\nTeacher：You incorrectly identified the minimum value of $ \\dfrac{1}{x} $ as $ 0 $. The minimum value of $ \\dfrac{1}{x} $ on $ (1, +\\infty) $ is not relevant for determining the condition of $ f'(x) \\geq 0 $. You must ensure $ k - \\dfrac{1}{x} \\geq 0 $ for all $ x > 1 $. What is the smallest value $ k $ can take to satisfy this inequality?\nStudent：The smallest value $k$ can take is $1$, so $k \\geq 1$.\nTeacher：Your error is that you incorrectly determined the smallest value of $ k $ to be $ 1 $.\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：What is the maximum value of $ \\dfrac{1}{x} $ on $ (1, +\\infty) $?\nStudent：The maximum value of $\\dfrac{1}{x}$ on $(1, +\\infty)$ is $1$ as $x$ approaches $1$ from the right.\nTeacher：To ensure $ f'(x) = k - \\dfrac{1}{x} \\geq 0 $ for all $ x > 1 $, $ k $ must be at least the maximum value of $ \\dfrac{1}{x} $ on this interval. Your error is that you incorrectly concluded $ k \\geq 1 $ without recognizing that $ k $ must be greater than or equal to the maximum of $ \\dfrac{1}{x} $, which is indeed $ 1 $, but your reasoning did not properly justify this conclusion.\nStudent：zzc",
