    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I wrote: $\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：Why do you think φ cannot be solved? What happens when you shift y = cos(2x + φ) to the right by π/2?\nStudent：When I shift $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, it becomes $y = \\cos\\left(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi\\right) = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：You correctly applied the shift. Now, since the shifted function equals $ y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) $, set $ \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) $. Do you recall a trigonometric identity that relates cosine and sine?\nStudent：No, I couldn't recall any relevant identity at the time.\nTeacher：The identity you need is cos(θ) = sin(θ + π/2). This means cos(2x - π + φ) can be written as sin(2x - π + φ + π/2).\nStudent：Oh, I see. I didn't think of using that identity.\nTeacher：You should now substitute the identity into the expression and equate it to sin(2x + π/3). What does the equation become after applying cos(2x - π + φ) = sin(2x - π + φ + π/2)?\nStudent：After applying the identity, the equation becomes: $\\sin(2x - \\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$.\nTeacher：You simplified the left side incorrectly. The expression $ -\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} $ is not zero. What is $ -\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} $?\nStudent：$-\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：The expression $ -\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} $ simplifies to $ -\\frac{\\pi}{2} $, so the argument of the sine function on the left becomes $ 2x + \\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} $. You now have $ \\sin(2x + \\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) $. For these sine functions to be equal for all $ x $, their arguments must differ by an integer multiple of $ 2\\pi $, or be symmetric about the sine wave's peaks. But since the functions are identical for all $ x $, the arguments must be equal modulo $ 2\\pi $. So set $ 2x + \\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi $ for some integer $ k $. Now subtract $ 2x $ from both sides. What do you get?\nStudent：I get $\\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You ignored the possibility of supplementary angles in the sine equality. The equation $\\sin A = \\sin B$ implies $A = B + 2k\\pi$ **or** $A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi$, but you only considered the first case. Your error is failing to consider the second case.\nStudent：I thought only $A = B + 2k\\pi$ needed to be considered, so I just used that one.\nTeacher：You assumed that $\\sin A = \\sin B$ implies only $A = B + 2k\\pi$, but it can also be that $A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi$. You failed to consider the latter case, which is necessary for a complete solution.\nStudent：I didn't realize that. I only used $A = B + 2k\\pi$ for my solution.\nTeacher：You assumed that $\\sin A = \\sin B$ implies only $A = B + 2k\\pi$, but you failed to consider the case $A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi$, which is equally valid and necessary for completeness.\nStudent：I didn't consider $A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi$, I only used $A = B + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You failed to consider the case $ A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi $ when solving $ \\sin A = \\sin B $.\nStudent：I didn't consider it, I just used $A = B + 2k\\pi$ when setting up the equation.\nTeacher：You failed to consider the case $ A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi $ when solving $ \\sin A = \\sin B $.\nStudent：I didn't consider that case, I only used $A = B + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You failed to consider the case $ A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi $ when solving $ \\sin A = \\sin B $.\nStudent：I didn't consider that possibility, I only worked with $A = B + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You failed to consider the case $ A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi $ when solving $ \\sin A = \\sin B $.\nStudent：I didn't consider that case, I only checked $A = B + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You failed to consider the case $ A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi $ when solving $ \\sin A = \\sin B $.\nStudent：I didn't consider that, I only thought about $A = B + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You failed to consider the case $ A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi $ when solving $ \\sin A = \\sin B $.\nStudent：I didn't consider that possibility, only $A = B + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You failed to consider the case $ A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi $ when solving $ \\sin A = \\sin B $.\nStudent：I didn't consider that, I only set $A = B + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You failed to consider the case $ A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi $ when solving $ \\sin A = \\sin B $.\nStudent：I didn't consider that possibility, I only set $A = B + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You failed to consider the case $ A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi $ when solving $ \\sin A = \\sin B $.\nStudent：I didn't consider that, I just used $A = B + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You failed to consider the case $ A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi $ when solving $ \\sin A = \\sin B $.\nStudent：I didn't consider that, I just used $A = B + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You failed to consider the case $ A = \\pi - B + 2k\\pi $ when solving $ \\sin A = \\sin B $.",
