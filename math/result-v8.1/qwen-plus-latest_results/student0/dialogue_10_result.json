After making this definitive statement, wait for the student's final response. If the student does not reply with \"zzc,\" you should then begin a new line of questioning in the next turn, but do not repeat the same diagnosis.\n**The prompt history contains past dialogues.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I directly tried to differentiate $f(x)$ to find the extrema, but the derivative was messy and I couldn't finish the calculations, so I didn't get a value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：You attempted to differentiate $ f(x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} $, but found the derivative too complicated to analyze. Did you consider whether the function has any symmetry, such as about $ x = 0 $? Have you evaluated $ f(-x) $?\nStudent：No, I didn't evaluate $f(-x)$ or look for symmetry. I just proceeded with differentiation.\nTeacher：The function satisfies $ f(-x) + f(x) = 2 $, implying that the sum of the maximum and minimum values is $ M + m = 2 $. Your mistake was not considering symmetry; you relied solely on differentiation without exploring algebraic or functional properties.\nStudent：zzc",
