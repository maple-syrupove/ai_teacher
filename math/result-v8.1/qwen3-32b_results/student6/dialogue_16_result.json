    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：Can you explain why you believe $\\phi$ cannot be solved?\nStudent：Because the two functions are a cosine and a sine function, and I didn't see a direct way to equate them.\nTeacher：Teacher：What is the relationship between cosine and sine functions in terms of phase shifts?\nStudent：Cosine and sine functions can be converted to each other by applying a phase shift of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Specifically, $\\sin\\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nTeacher：Given that relationship, what does the equation $ \\cos(2x + \\phi) $, shifted right by $ \\frac{\\pi}{2} $, become?\nStudent：Shifting $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ gives $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi - 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$.\nTeacher：Your expression for the phase shift is incorrect.\nStudent：I thought that shifting to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ for $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ means subtracting $2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ from the input.\nTeacher：How is a horizontal shift applied to a function of the form $ y = \\cos(2x + \\phi) $?\nStudent：A horizontal shift of $a$ units to the right means replacing $x$ with $x - a$, so it becomes $y = \\cos(2(x - a) + \\phi) = \\cos(2x + \\phi - 2a)$.\nTeacher：Correct. Then what is the expression after shifting $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$?\nStudent：It becomes $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the horizontal shift by subtracting $2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, but this is not necessary. The correct expression after shifting right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$.\nStudent：Okay, after the shift, we have $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$.\nTeacher：The correct expression after the shift is $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$, but you failed to use the identity $\\cos(\\theta - \\pi) = -\\cos(\\theta)$.\nStudent：I see, but I thought if I use the identity, I still have two different trigonometric functions, so I didn't proceed further.\nTeacher：You attempted to shift the function correctly but failed to recognize that $ \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi) = -\\cos(2x + \\phi) $, which is essential for comparing it to a sine function.\nStudent：zzc",
