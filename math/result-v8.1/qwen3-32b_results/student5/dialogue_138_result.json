Then, I checked each to see if they could form a Pythagorean triple. I found 3 sets that I thought worked.\nTeacher：What criteria did you use to determine that a set forms a Pythagorean triple?\nStudent：I checked if the squares of any two numbers in the set added up to the square of the third number.\nTeacher：Which specific sets did you identify as forming a Pythagorean triple?\nStudent：I thought that (2,3,5), (3,4,5), and (1,2,3) could form Pythagorean triples.\nTeacher：Which of these sets actually satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, and which do not?\nStudent：Only (3,4,5) actually satisfies the Pythagorean theorem.
