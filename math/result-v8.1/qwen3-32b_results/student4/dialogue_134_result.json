After making this definitive statement, wait for the student's final response. If the student does not reply with \"zzc,\" you should then begin a new line of questioning in the next turn, but do not repeat the same diagnosis.\n**The prompt history contains past dialogues. Strictly avoid mimicking the student's tone or restating their answers for analysis.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is D. $[1, +\\infty)$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined the condition for monotonic increase?\nStudent：I set $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0$, so I got $k \\geq \\frac{1}{x}$.\nTeacher：Teacher：Why is $k \\geq \\frac{1}{x}$ sufficient for monotonic increase on $(1, +\\infty)$?\nStudent：Because I thought as $x$ increases, $\\frac{1}{x}$ gets smaller, so if $k$ is at least $\\frac{1}{x}$, $f'(x)$ stays non-negative.\nTeacher：What is the correct condition for $f'(x) \\geq 0$ to hold for all $x \\in (1, +\\infty)$?\nStudent：It should be $k \\geq \\frac{1}{x}$ for every $x$ in $(1, +\\infty)$, so $k$ needs to satisfy this for all those $x$.\nTeacher：What is the minimum value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ on the interval $(1, +\\infty)$?\nStudent：The minimum value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ on $(1, +\\infty)$ is $0$, as $x$ approaches infinity.\nTeacher：Then why did you conclude that $k \\geq 1$?\nStudent：Because when $x = 1$, $\\frac{1}{x} = 1$, so I thought $k \\geq 1$ is needed.\nTeacher：You incorrectly based your conclusion on the value of $ \\frac{1}{x} $ at a single point rather than its supremum over the interval.\nStudent：zzc",
