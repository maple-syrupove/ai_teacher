    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer is: $\\phi$ cannot be solved.\n教师：What is the relationship between shifting a cosine graph to the right and transforming it into a sine graph in terms of the phase shift value?\n学生：Shifting a cosine graph to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is equivalent to increasing its phase by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n教师：What happens if you apply the same transformation to the cosine function $y=\\cos(2x+\\phi)$ and try to match it with the sine function $y=\\sin\\left(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$?\n学生：If I shift $y=\\cos(2x+\\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, it becomes $y=\\cos(2x + \\phi - 2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$. I tried to match this with $y=\\sin\\left(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ but couldn't relate them directly, so I thought $\\phi$ couldn't be solved.\n教师：What relation can you identify between the functions $\\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$ and $\\sin\\left(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ after applying the given transformation to the cosine function?\n学生：I noticed that $\\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$ and $\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})$ are different types of trigonometric functions, and I didn't see a direct connection between them.\n教师：What relationship do you observe between the trigonometric functions $\\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$ and $\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})$ in terms of their phase shifts and differences?\n学生：I see that their phases are both shifted compared to the standard functions, but since one is cosine and the other is sine, I still don't know how to directly compare or equate them.\n教师：What can you infer about the relationship between the phase shift in $\\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$ and $\\sin\\left(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ considering their specific values and properties when comparing them as given in the problem?\n学生：I think the phase shift expressions are both in terms of $2x$, but since one is cosine and one is sine, I don't see how to equate them without additional information.\n教师：The mistake lies in your interpretation of the phase shift in terms of $2x$. Think about the specific values of the phase shifts in $\\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$ and $\\sin\\left(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$. Can you identify any discrepancy in how you are comparing them?\n学生：I focused on the phase shifts as expressions, but didn't think to convert one function to match the other's type for direct comparison.\n教师：Your analysis is on the right track. Can you think of a way to convert one of the functions to match the type of the other function to facilitate a direct comparison of their phase shifts?\n学生：I didn't think to use an identity like $\\sin\\theta = \\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ to convert the sine into a cosine for comparison.\n教师：The mistake lies in your omission to utilize trigonometric identities to convert one function into the same type as the other for direct comparison.\n学生：zzc",
