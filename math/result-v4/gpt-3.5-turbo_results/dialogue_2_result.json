    "history_prompt": "\n学生：I chose C, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n教师：What relationship exists between $\\sin 2 \\alpha$ and $\\cos(2\\alpha)$?\n学生：They are related through the Pythagorean identity: $\\sin^2 2\\alpha + \\cos^2 2\\alpha = 1$.\n教师：What should be the Pythagorean identity relating $\\sin^2 2\\alpha$ and $\\cos^2 2\\alpha$ in terms of $\\sin 2\\alpha$ and $\\cos 2\\alpha$?\n学生：The identity is: $(\\sin 2\\alpha)^2 + (\\cos 2\\alpha)^2 = 1$. So, $\\sin^2 2\\alpha = 1 - \\cos^2 2\\alpha$.\n教师：What should be the relationship between $\\sin^2 2\\alpha$ and $\\cos^2 2\\alpha$ instead of $\\sin^2 2\\alpha = 1 - \\cos^2 2\\alpha$ based on the Pythagorean identity?\n学生：The relationship is $(\\sin 2\\alpha)^2 + (\\cos 2\\alpha)^2 = 1$, which means $\\cos^2 2\\alpha = 1 - (\\sin 2\\alpha)^2$.\n教师：Your understanding of the Pythagorean identity is heading in the right direction. However, in this context, you need to consider the relationship between $\\sin 2\\alpha$ and $\\cos 2\\alpha$ to correctly find $\\cos(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$. Can you revisit the relationship between $\\cos$ and $\\sin$ angles?\n学生：For related angles, we have $\\cos(\\theta) = \\sqrt{1-\\sin^2(\\theta)}$ if the quadrant is known, and also identities like $\\cos(\\alpha+\\beta) = \\cos\\alpha\\cos\\beta - \\sin\\alpha\\sin\\beta$.\n教师：What connection can you make between the given information $\\sin 2 \\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$ and the expression you need to find $\\cos^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$?\n学生：I tried to substitute $\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$ directly into $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$, thinking they were equivalent angles.\n教师：Your mistake is noted. Can you reflect on the relationship between equivalent angles and what it implies for trigonometric functions when working with them?\n学生：Equivalent angles must have the same measure, but $\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ is not the same as $2\\alpha$, so their sine values are not equal.\n教师：Your reflection is accurate. Equivalent angles have the same trigonometric function values, but in this case, $\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ is not the same angle as $2\\alpha$, leading to different trigonometric values.\n学生：zzc",
