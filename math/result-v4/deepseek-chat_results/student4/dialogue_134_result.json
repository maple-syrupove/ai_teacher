    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was: D. $[1,+\\infty)$.\nTeacher：Let me understand your reasoning. What condition must the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) satisfy for the function to be monotonically increasing on \\( (1, +\\infty) \\)?\nStudent：The derivative $f'(x)$ must satisfy $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x > 1$.\nTeacher：What is the expression you obtained for \\( f'(x) \\) when you differentiated \\( f(x) = kx - \\ln x \\)?\nStudent：I got $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}$.\nTeacher：You correctly found the derivative. Now, considering \\( x > 1 \\), what inequality must hold for \\( k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0 \\) to be true for all \\( x > 1 \\)?\nStudent：For all $x > 1$, we need $k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0$, which is $k \\geq \\frac{1}{x}$ for all $x > 1$.\nTeacher：Let's analyze this carefully. If \\( k \\geq \\frac{1}{x} \\) must hold for all \\( x > 1 \\), what's the smallest possible value that \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) can take as \\( x \\) increases beyond 1?\nStudent：As $x$ increases beyond 1, $\\frac{1}{x}$ approaches $0$, so the smallest possible value is $0$.\nTeacher：Your error is in concluding that \\( k \\geq 0 \\) is sufficient. The condition must hold for all \\( x > 1 \\), including values very close to 1 where \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) approaches 1.\nStudent：I see. Since $x$ can get arbitrarily close to 1, $\\frac{1}{x}$ approaches 1 from below, so $k$ must be at least 1.\nTeacher：zzc\nStudent：\nTeacher：Your error was in initially considering only the limiting behavior as \\( x \\to +\\infty \\) while neglecting the behavior near \\( x = 1 \\).\nStudent：zzc",
