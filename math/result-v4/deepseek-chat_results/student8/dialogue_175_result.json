    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Let me ask: How did you simplify the expression in option A? What steps did you take to determine it's purely imaginary?\nStudent：I saw the $i$ and $(1+i)$ and thought multiplying them with $i$ would give a purely imaginary number, so I didn’t actually expand $(1+i)^2$ or multiply it out.\nTeacher：I see. Let me ask: What happens when you actually expand $(1+i)^2$ in option A? Would the result still be purely imaginary after multiplication with $i$?\nStudent：Expanding $(1+i)^2$ gives $1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$. Then $i \\times 2i = 2i^2 = -2$, which is real, not imaginary.\nTeacher：Your error was assuming the expression would remain purely imaginary without fully expanding it. The final result became real (-2) rather than purely imaginary.\nStudent：zzc",
