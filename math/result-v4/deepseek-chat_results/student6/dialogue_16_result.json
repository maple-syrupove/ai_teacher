    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: $\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：Let me understand your thinking. Can you explain how you approached the phase shift when the graph is shifted to the right by π/2 units?\nStudent：When the graph is shifted right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, I replaced $x$ with $x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ in $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$, so it became $y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：Let's examine your transformation step. When you replaced x with (x - π/2), did you consider how this affects the argument of the cosine function? Specifically, what happens to the coefficient of x after this substitution?\nStudent：After substituting $x$ with $x-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the argument becomes $2(x-\\frac{\\pi}{2})+\\phi = 2x - \\pi + \\phi$.\nTeacher：Let's focus on the next step. After obtaining the transformed function y = cos(2x - π + φ), how did you set this equal to the given sin function? What trigonometric identity did you use?\nStudent：I didn't use any specific trigonometric identity. I just compared $y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$ directly with $y = \\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$ and couldn't make them match, so I concluded $\\phi$ couldn't be solved.\nTeacher：Let me ask this: Do you recall any identity that relates cosine to sine, particularly involving phase shifts? For example, how can cos(A) be expressed in terms of sine?\nStudent：Yes, I remember that $\\cos(A)$ can be written as $\\sin(A + \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nTeacher：Let's apply that identity to your transformed function. What do you get when you express cos(2x - π + φ) in terms of sine?\nStudent：If I use that identity, $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) = \\sin(2x - \\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nTeacher：Now compare this with the given function y = sin(2x + π/3). What's the relationship between the arguments of these sine functions?\nStudent：The arguments must be equal, so $2x - \\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, which I can solve for $\\phi$.\nTeacher：Let me verify: Did you simplify the equation correctly by canceling the 2x terms and combining the constant terms (-π + π/2) before solving for φ?\nStudent：No, I did not simplify the equation at that step. I stopped because I did not realize I could proceed this way.\nTeacher：I see your error. You stopped solving because you didn't recognize that the equation could be simplified by canceling the 2x terms and combining constant terms.\nStudent：zzc",
