    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: I couldn't find a precise value for $M+m$ because I tried to directly differentiate $f(x)$, but the calculations became too complicated, and I did not finish.\nTeacher：Let me ask: Did you consider simplifying the function before attempting differentiation?\nStudent：No, I didn't simplify the function before differentiating. I just started differentiating the original expression as it was.\nTeacher：Let me ask: What specific difficulties did you encounter when differentiating the unsimplified function?\nStudent：The derivative resulted in a complex expression involving both polynomials and trigonometric functions, leading to algebraic manipulation errors and making it hard to solve for critical points.\nTeacher：Let me ask: Did you consider alternative approaches, such as analyzing the behavior of the function at extreme values or symmetry, before resorting to differentiation?\nStudent：No, I went straight to calculating the derivative without considering other approaches like analyzing limits or symmetry.\nTeacher：Let me ask: Did you check if the function has any obvious symmetry or periodicity that could simplify finding its extrema?\nStudent：No, I didn't check for symmetry or periodicity; I only focused on the derivative calculation.\nTeacher：Let me ask: Did you evaluate the function at simple points like x=0 or x=1 to potentially identify extreme values?\nStudent：No, I didn't evaluate $f(x)$ at simple points like $x=0$ or $x=1$ during my process.\nTeacher：Let me ask: Did you consider splitting the function into simpler components, like $\\frac{(x+1)^2}{x^2+1}$ and $\\frac{\\sin x}{x^2+1}$, to analyze their contributions separately?\nStudent：No, I didn't think to split the function into separate components for analysis. I kept it as a whole and tried differentiating directly.\nTeacher：Let me ask: Did you notice that the denominator $x^2+1$ appears in both terms when you split the function, potentially allowing for simpler analysis?\nStudent：No, I didn't notice that the denominator $x^2+1$ could help to simplify the analysis by splitting the function.\nTeacher：Your error was not recognizing that the function can be rewritten as $f(x) = 1 + \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$, which simplifies the analysis significantly.\nStudent：zzc",
