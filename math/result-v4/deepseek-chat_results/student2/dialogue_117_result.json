    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：Let me understand your approach. Did you use the double-angle identity for cosine when solving this problem?\nStudent：No, I didn't use the double-angle identity for cosine. I just tried to rewrite $\\cos^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ using a sine formula instead.\nTeacher：Let's examine your approach. What specific sine formula did you use to rewrite $\\cos^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$?\nStudent：I used the formula $\\cos^2 A = 1 - \\sin^2 A$ to rewrite $\\cos^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ as $1 - \\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$.\nTeacher：Let's check your transformation. Did you consider the angle addition when applying $\\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$?\nStudent：No, I didn't really consider the angle addition formula for sine. I just saw $\\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ and directly thought about plugging in values.\nTeacher：Let me ask this: When you saw $\\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$, did you expand it using the sine addition formula before attempting to substitute values?\nStudent：No, I didn't expand it. I just saw $\\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ and wanted to substitute a value directly, without expanding.\nTeacher：Let me clarify: Did you assume $\\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ equals $\\sin^2\\alpha + \\sin^2\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ when substituting values?\nStudent：No, I didn't assume it was equal to $\\sin^2\\alpha + \\sin^2\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. I just thought about substituting the value I had for $\\sin 2\\alpha$.\nTeacher：Let me understand: Did you substitute $\\sin 2\\alpha$ directly into $\\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ without any transformation?\nStudent：Yes, I directly substituted the value of $\\sin 2\\alpha$ into $\\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ without transforming it.\nTeacher：Your error is directly substituting $\\sin 2\\alpha$ into $\\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ without proper angle transformation.\nStudent：zzc",
