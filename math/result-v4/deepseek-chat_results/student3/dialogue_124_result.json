    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Let me ask: What is the definition of an odd function? How would you test if $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ satisfies this definition?\nStudent：An odd function satisfies $h(-x) = -h(x)$ for all $x$. To test $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$, I would substitute $-x$ and check if $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = -|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：Let's examine your test: Does the equation $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = -|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ make sense when considering the properties of absolute value?\nStudent：No, it doesn't make sense, because the absolute value always yields a non-negative result. $-|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ would be non-positive, so they can't be equal unless both are zero.\nTeacher：You've identified a key issue. Now consider: Does the absolute value operation preserve the odd function property when applied to $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$?\nStudent：No, the absolute value operation does not preserve the odd function property because it always produces a non-negative result, so the function cannot be odd.\nTeacher：You've correctly identified that the absolute value operation prevents the function from being odd. Now, can you see why your initial choice D was incorrect?\nStudent：Yes, I see now—since $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ cannot be negative, it can't satisfy the odd function property, so D is incorrect.\nTeacher：zzc\nStudent：Understood, teacher.\nTeacher：Let's analyze another option. What was your reasoning for considering option D before realizing it was incorrect?\nStudent：At first, I thought multiplying an odd and an even function might still result in something with odd symmetry, and I didn’t analyze it with direct substitution.\nTeacher：Let's focus on your initial thought process. When you considered option D, did you verify the property for both positive and negative values of x?\nStudent：No, I didn't check both positive and negative values of $x$ by substitution; I relied on intuition.\nTeacher：Let me ask: What happens when you substitute $-x$ into $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ using the given properties of $f$ and $g$?\nStudent：When substituting $-x$, we have $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |{-f(x)} \\cdot g(x)| = |{-f(x)}g(x)| = |f(x)g(x)|$.\nTeacher：Let me ask: Does the result $|f(x)g(x)|$ equal $-|f(x)g(x)|$ for all $x$, as required by the definition of an odd function?\nStudent：No, $|f(x)g(x)|$ does not equal $-|f(x)g(x)|$ for all $x$ except when $f(x)g(x)=0$.\nTeacher：You've correctly identified that the equality only holds when the function equals zero. Now, does this satisfy the definition of an odd function for all x in its domain?\nStudent：No, it does not satisfy the definition of an odd function for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Let me ask: What must be true for a function to be odd at every point in its domain?\nStudent：For a function to be odd at every point, $h(-x) = -h(x)$ must hold for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Let me ask: Does $|f(x)g(x)|$ satisfy $h(-x)=-h(x)$ for all $x$ where $f(x)g(x)\\neq 0$?\nStudent：No, $|f(x)g(x)|$ does not satisfy $h(-x) = -h(x)$ for all $x$ where $f(x)g(x) \\neq 0$.\nTeacher：Your error was assuming the absolute value of a product could satisfy the odd function condition. The absolute value operation destroys the odd symmetry property.\nStudent：zzc",
