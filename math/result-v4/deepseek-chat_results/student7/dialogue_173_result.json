    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was B. I thought A∩B = ∅.\nTeacher：Let me ask: How did you determine that sets A and B have no overlapping elements?\nStudent：I looked at A: $x<2$ and B: $3-2x>0$, but I didn't change B to standard form. I thought their overlap was empty.\nTeacher：I see. Let me ask: What would set B become if you solved the inequality 3-2x > 0 for x?\nStudent：If I solve $3-2x>0$ for $x$, then $-2x>-3$, so $x<\\frac{3}{2}$. So, $B = \\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2}\\}$.\nTeacher：Now that you've expressed B as {x | x < 3/2}, can you explain how you concluded A∩B is empty when both sets contain numbers less than 3/2?\nStudent：I didn't convert B when comparing; I just compared A: $x<2$ and B's original form. I didn't see their actual overlap.\nTeacher：Your error was comparing the sets in different forms without properly analyzing their intersection after expressing both in standard inequality form.\nStudent：zzc",
