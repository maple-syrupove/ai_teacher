    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Let's analyze the properties of $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $. If $ f(x) $ is odd and $ g(x) $ is even, what happens to $ f(-x) \\cdot g(-x) $?\nStudent：$f(-x)$, since $f(x)$ is odd, is $-f(x)$. $g(-x)$, since $g(x)$ is even, is $g(x)$. So $f(-x) \\cdot g(-x) = -f(x) \\cdot g(x)$.\nTeacher：Then, what is $ |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| $? How does it compare to $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $?\nStudent：$|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = |-f(x)\\cdot g(x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$, so they are equal.\nTeacher：Then, $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is even, not odd. Therefore, D is incorrect.\nStudent：Oh, I see now. Thank you for explaining. So, D is actually incorrect.\nTeacher：You're welcome. Let's examine another option. What is the nature of $ f(x) \\cdot |g(x)| $? Is it odd or even?\nStudent：Let’s see: $f(-x) \\cdot |g(-x)| = (-f(x)) \\cdot |g(x)| = -f(x) \\cdot |g(x)|$. So, it is an odd function.\nTeacher：C is correct. You correctly identified that $ f(-x) \\cdot |g(-x)| = -f(x) \\cdot |g(x)| $, which satisfies the definition of an odd function. Therefore, your reasoning for option C is accurate.\nStudent：Thank you. My original answer was D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：You initially chose D, but through analysis, we determined that $ |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| $ is even, not odd. Therefore, your original answer was incorrect.\nStudent：zzc",
