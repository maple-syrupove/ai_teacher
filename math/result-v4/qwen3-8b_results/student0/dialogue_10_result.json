    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: I couldn't get a specific value for $M + m$ because the calculations got too complex when differentiating $f(x)$ directly.\nTeacher：What did you do with the numerator $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x$ when simplifying $f(x)$?\nStudent：I didn't simplify the numerator; I just kept it as $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x$ and tried to differentiate it directly.\nTeacher：What did you do with the denominator $x^2 + 1$ when differentiating $f(x)$?\nStudent：I treated the denominator as it was, using the quotient rule to differentiate $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ directly without any simplification.\nTeacher：What did you do with the derivative of the numerator $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x$?\nStudent：I calculated the derivative as $2(x+1) + \\cos x$ for the numerator when applying the quotient rule.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated the derivative of the numerator, but you did not simplify the expression for $ f'(x) $ before setting it equal to zero. This likely led to an overly complex equation that was difficult to solve.\nStudent：zzc",
