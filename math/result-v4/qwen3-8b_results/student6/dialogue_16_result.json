    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I couldn’t solve for $\\phi$ and concluded that “$\\phi$ cannot be solved.”\nTeacher：To solve for $\\phi$, you need to use the relationship between cosine and sine functions. What is the phase shift formula for a cosine function?\nStudent：The phase shift formula for a cosine function $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ is $-\\frac{\\phi}{2}$ units horizontally.\nTeacher：You are correct about the phase shift formula, but you need to consider how shifting the graph of $ y = \\cos(2x + \\phi) $ to the right by $ \\frac{\\pi}{2} $ affects its equation. What is the new equation after the shift?\nStudent：After shifting right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the new equation is $y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi) = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly transformed the equation after the shift. Now, what is the relationship between $ \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) $ and $ \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) $?\nStudent：I didn’t notice any direct relationship, so I thought there was no way to equate the two or solve for $\\phi$.\nTeacher：You need to express both functions in terms of the same trigonometric function. What identity can you use to convert cosine to sine?\nStudent：I forgot to use any identity here. I'm not sure—maybe there’s one that connects cosine and sine, but I didn’t think of it.\nTeacher：You need to recall the identity that relates cosine and sine, such as $ \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $. Have you considered this?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider using the identity $\\cos(\\theta) = \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ in my solution.\nTeacher：You have not applied the identity $ \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $, which is essential for equating the two functions. This omission prevents you from solving for $ \\phi $.\nStudent：zzc",
