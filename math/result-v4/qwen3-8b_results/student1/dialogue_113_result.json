    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My incorrect answer was A. $\\{-2, -1, 0, 1\\}$.\nTeacher：The set $M$ includes real numbers between $-3$ and $1$, but not including $-3$ and $1$. Did you consider whether $1$ is included in $M$?\nStudent：No, I didn't pay attention to whether $1$ is included in $M$ specifically.\nTeacher：The element $1$ is not included in $M$, as $M$ is defined as $-3 < x < 1$. Therefore, $1$ cannot be in the intersection $M \\cap N$. Is there another element in $N$ that you might have incorrectly included?\nStudent：I think I might have also included $-3$, but $-3$ is not in $M$ because $-3 < x < 1$ does not contain $-3$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $-3$ is not in $M$, but you still included $1$ in your answer. Since $1$ is not in $M$, it cannot be in the intersection $M \\cap N$. Therefore, your answer includes an incorrect element.\nStudent：I see, so among the elements of $N$, only $-2$, $-1$, and $0$ are actually included in $M$.\nTeacher：Therefore, the correct answer should be C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$. You included an incorrect element ($1$) in your answer.\nStudent：Yes, I mistakenly included $1$ in my answer even though $1$ is not in $M$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I understand now that the correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I understand now that I should carefully compare each element of $N$ with the interval of $M$ first.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I will pay attention to compare set elements with the interval's boundaries from now on.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I understand that C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$ is the correct answer. I'll be more careful with interval boundaries.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I will remember to carefully check which elements fit in the interval next time.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I will pay more attention next time to avoid this mistake. C. $\\{-2,-1,0\\}$ is the correct answer.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I understand now that I must properly identify the set range before selecting intersection elements.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I understand the correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$. I'll analyze set ranges carefully next time.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I will make sure to check set intervals first and compare carefully before choosing the answer.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I will always compare the set elements with the interval strictly in the future.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I will always make sure to clarify interval boundaries and compare set elements precisely before answering.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I understand and will check interval boundaries and set elements more carefully in future problems.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I completely understand now and will make sure to select set elements matching the interval next time.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I completely understand now and will ensure I match set elements properly to interval boundaries next time.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I understand now and will double-check both set entries and interval boundaries in the future.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. The correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.",
