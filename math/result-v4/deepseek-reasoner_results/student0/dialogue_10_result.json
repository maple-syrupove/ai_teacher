    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was: I couldn’t determine the exact value of $M+m$ because my derivative calculations became too messy, and I didn’t finish the problem.\nTeacher：Have you considered simplifying the expression for \\(f(x)\\) before differentiating? What happens if you split the numerator?\nStudent：I didn't try splitting the numerator; I directly attempted to differentiate the original function. Should I have rewritten $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x$ first?\nTeacher：Based on our dialogue, I see you attempted differentiation without first simplifying \\(f(x)\\). When you computed the derivative of \\(\\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}\\) directly, did the quotient rule produce an expression with multiple trigonometric and polynomial terms that became unmanageable?\nStudent：Yes, the derivative got very complicated with both polynomial and trigonometric terms, which made it hard for me to solve for the extrema.\nTeacher：Your error was in not simplifying \\( f(x) \\) by splitting the numerator before differentiating, which caused the derivative to become unmanageably complex.\nStudent：zzc",
