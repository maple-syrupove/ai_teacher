    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：To verify your choice, recall the definitions: for any function \\(h(x)\\), if \\(h(-x) = -h(x)\\), it's odd. Now, using \\(f(-x) = -f(x)\\) and \\(g(-x) = g(x)\\), what is \\(|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|\\)?\nStudent：\\(|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |(-f(x)) \\cdot g(x)| = |-f(x)g(x)| = |f(x)g(x)|\\)\nTeacher：You found that \\( |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x)g(x)| \\). For \\( h(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| \\) to be odd, what must hold between \\( h(-x) \\) and \\( -h(x) \\)? Specifically, does \\( |f(x)g(x)| = -|f(x)g(x)| \\) for all \\( x \\)?\nStudent：No, \\(|f(x)g(x)| = -|f(x)g(x)|\\) only if \\(|f(x)g(x)| = 0\\). Otherwise, the equality doesn't hold for all \\(x\\).\nTeacher：Based on our discussion, you recognized that for \\( h(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| \\), we have \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), but for it to be odd, we need \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\). This only holds if \\( h(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), which isn't guaranteed. Therefore, your initial error was concluding that \\( |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| \\) is odd when it is not.\nStudent：zzc",
