    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：To identify your error, what did you get when you computed \\((1+i)^2\\) in option A?\nStudent：When I calculate \\((1+i)^2\\), I get \\(1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i\\).\nTeacher：After computing \\((1+i)^2 = 2i\\) for option A, what did you obtain when you multiplied it by \\(i\\)?\nStudent：Multiplying \\(2i\\) by \\(i\\), I got \\(2i \\times i = 2i^2 = 2(-1) = -2\\).\nTeacher：Based on your calculation for option A:  \nYou obtained \\((1+i)^2 = 2i\\), then multiplied by \\(i\\) to get \\(2i \\cdot i = 2i^2 = -2\\).  \nThis result (\\(-2\\)) is a real number.  \n\nNow, recall the definition:  \n**What property must a purely imaginary number satisfy?**\nStudent：A purely imaginary number has a real part equal to zero and a nonzero imaginary part.\nTeacher：To pinpoint your error in selecting option A, recall that you computed \\(i(1+i)^2 = -2\\), a real number. Given the definition of purely imaginary numbers, why did you initially believe this result satisfied the condition?\nStudent：I saw the $i$ and $(1+i)$ terms and assumed the answer must involve only imaginary parts, without actually checking by calculation.\nTeacher：Based on your admission that you assumed without calculating, and your computation showing \\(i(1+i)^2 = -2\\) (a real number), what contradiction exists between your result and the requirement for a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：The contradiction is that my result, \\(-2\\), is a real number with no imaginary part, but a purely imaginary number should have only an imaginary part and zero as the real part.\nTeacher：Your error is selecting option A without verifying by calculation, and your computation shows it yields a real number (-2), not a purely imaginary one.\nStudent：zzc",
