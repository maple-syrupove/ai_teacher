Specifically, is $x=1$ included in M?\nStudent：The condition $-3 < x < 1$ means that $x$ is greater than $-3$ but less than $1$, so $x=1$ is not included in M.\nTeacher：Based on your answer A including 1, and your agreement that 1 is not in M, why do you believe 1 belongs in the intersection M ∩ N?\nStudent：I mistakenly considered all elements in N between -3 and 1, without excluding the endpoint 1, so I included 1 by error.\nTeacher：Based on our discussion, your error is including the element 1 in \\(M \\cap N\\), because \\(1 \\notin M\\) due to the strict inequality \\(-3 < x < 1\\).\nStudent：zzc",
