    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My incorrect answer: I chose $k > 0$.\nTeacher：To identify your error, let's analyze the condition for monotonic increase. What must be true about the derivative \\(f'(x)\\) for \\(f(x)\\) to be monotonically increasing on \\((1, \\infty)\\)? \n\n**Do not reply with \"zzc\" yet.**\nStudent：For $f(x)$ to be monotonically increasing on $(1, \\infty)$, the derivative $f'(x)$ must be greater than or equal to $0$ for all $x > 1$.\nTeacher：To identify your error, consider a specific value. If \\( k = 0.5 \\), what is \\( f'(1.1) \\)? Is it non-negative?\nStudent：If $k = 0.5$, then $f'(1.1) = 0.5 - \\dfrac{1}{1.1} \\approx 0.5 - 0.91 = -0.41$, which is negative. So $f'(1.1)<0$.\nTeacher：Your error is assuming that any positive \\(k\\) suffices for monotonic increase. However, \\(k\\) must be at least 1 because as \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right, \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) approaches 1, requiring \\(k \\geq 1\\) to ensure \\(f'(x) \\geq 0\\).\nStudent：zzc",
