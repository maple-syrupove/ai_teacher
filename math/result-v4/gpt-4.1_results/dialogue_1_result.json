    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer is A. I chose $\\{-2, -1, 0, 1\\}$.\n教师：Let's carefully consider whether the element $1$ should be in $M$. Is $1$ included in the set $\\{x \\mid -3 < x < 1\\}$?\n学生：No, $1$ is not included in the set $M$ because $x$ must be less than $1$, not equal to $1$.\n教师：You correctly identified that $1$ is not an element of $M$, so including it in your answer was an error.\n学生：Yes, I understand now. Since $1$ is not in $M$, it shouldn't be in the intersection.\n教师：Good. Are you now confident about which elements from $N$ are actually in both sets, given your correction regarding $1$?\n学生：Based on this correction, from $N$, only $-2$, $-1$, and $0$ satisfy $-3 < x < 1$, so the intersection should be $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\n教师：Your reasoning is now correct: the only mistake in your first answer was including $1$, which is not an element of $M$.\n学生：But actually, in my initial attempt, I just took all the numbers from $N$ that fell between $-3$ and $1$, without clearly considering the boundaries.\n教师：Thank you for clarifying your process. The mistake in your initial attempt was not carefully considering the exclusion of the endpoints $-3$ and $1$ when determining the intersection.\n学生：zzc",
