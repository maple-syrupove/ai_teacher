    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I couldn't solve for $\\phi$. I thought it couldn't be determined.\nTeacher：Let me ask you this: When a function is shifted to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, how does that affect the argument of the cosine function?\nStudent：Shifting to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ means we replace $x$ with $x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ in the argument. So, the new function is $y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：Correct. Then what is the simplified form of this new function?\nStudent：The simplified form is $y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：Good. Now, the problem states that this shifted cosine function coincides with $y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$. What must be true about these two functions for their graphs to coincide?\nStudent：The two functions must be equal for all $x$, so their arguments must be related in such a way that $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ for all $x$.\nTeacher：What relationship exists between sine and cosine that could help equate these two expressions?\nStudent：I didn't think of a relationship that could convert cosine to sine or vice versa, so I wasn’t sure how to proceed.\nTeacher：Teacher：Consider this: $\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. How might you apply this identity here?\nStudent：If I use that identity, I can write $\\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$ as $\\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nTeacher：Now, simplify the argument of the cosine function on the right-hand side. What do you get?\nStudent：Simplifying, $2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}$. So it becomes $\\cos\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)$.\nTeacher：Therefore, we now have $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) = \\cos\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)$. What does this imply about the arguments of the cosine functions?\nStudent：This implies that $2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$ or $2x - \\pi + \\phi = -(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) + 2k\\pi$, for some integer $k$.\nTeacher：Very good. But let's consider the first case: $2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$. What can you conclude about $\\phi$ from this equation?\nStudent：From this equation, I get $\\phi = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：Now consider the constraint $-\\pi \\leqslant \\phi < \\pi$. Is $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$ consistent with this?\nStudent：For $k=0$, $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$, and it does fall within $-\\pi \\leqslant \\phi < \\pi$.\nTeacher：What about the second case? $2x - \\pi + \\phi = -(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) + 2k\\pi$. What can you conclude from this?\nStudent：Expanding, $2x - \\pi + \\phi = -2x + \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$. Solving for $\\phi$, we get $2x + 2x - \\pi + \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$, so $4x + \\phi = \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$, but then $\\phi$ must depend on $x$, which is not allowed. So this case doesn't work.\nTeacher：Correct. This case leads to $\\phi$ depending on $x$, which is invalid because $\\phi$ must be a constant. Therefore, the only valid solution comes from the first case. \n\nThe mistake you made earlier was concluding that $\\phi$ could not be determined. In fact, $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ satisfies all conditions.\nStudent：zzc",
