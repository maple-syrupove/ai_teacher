    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was B. $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$.\n\nTeacher：Can you explain how you arrived at the conclusion that $ A \\cap B = \\varnothing $?\nStudent：I looked at $A$ as all $x<2$ and $B$ as a different set, but since $A \\cap B$ as “similar parts”, I wrote $A \\cap B=\\{x \\mid x<2\\}$. That answer wasn’t in the options, so I chose B, “∅”.\nTeacher：What is the correct condition that defines set $ B $?\nStudent：Set $B$ is defined by $3-2x>0$. Solving gives $x<\\frac{3}{2}$, so $B=\\{x \\mid x<\\frac{3}{2}\\}$.\nTeacher：Then what is the relationship between sets $ A $ and $ B $?\nStudent：The relationship is that $B$ is a subset of $A$, since $x<\\frac{3}{2}$ is included in $x<2$. So, $B\\subseteq A$.\nTeacher：If $ B \\subseteq A $, then what should $ A \\cap B $ be?\nStudent：If $B \\subseteq A$, then $A \\cap B$ should be exactly $B$, so $A \\cap B = \\{x \\mid x<\\frac{3}{2}\\}$.\nTeacher：That is correct. Then why did you initially conclude that $ A \\cap B = \\varnothing $?\nStudent：At first, I just looked for $x<2$ as the intersection, but since that option wasn’t listed, I guessed and picked $\\varnothing$ instead.\nTeacher：Your error was assuming that $ A \\cap B = \\varnothing $ simply because $ \\{x \\mid x < 2\\} $ wasn’t among the answer choices.\nStudent：zzc",
