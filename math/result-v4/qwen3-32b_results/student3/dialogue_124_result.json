    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined that the absolute value of the product must be an odd function?\nStudent：I thought that since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, intuitively, their product with absolute value might be odd. I didn't check by substituting $-x$ into the expression.\nTeacher：Teacher：Let me ask: What does it mean for a function to be odd, and what happens when you apply absolute value to an odd function?\nStudent：A function is odd if $f(-x) = -f(x)$. When applying absolute value to an odd function, $|f(-x)| = |f(x)|$, making it even.\nTeacher：So, if the absolute value of an odd function is even, how does that affect your reasoning about option D?\nStudent：That means $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ should also be an even function, not an odd function as I initially thought.\nTeacher：Correct. The absolute value of an odd function is even, so your initial conclusion about option D was incorrect.\nStudent：zzc",
