    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I answered: \"$\\phi$ cannot be solved.\"\nTeacher：Can you explain why you think $\\phi$ cannot be solved?\nStudent：I thought the two functions were of different types, one cosine and one sine, so I couldn't set them equal directly. I didn’t see a way to compare them, so I concluded $\\phi$ couldn’t be solved.\nTeacher：When you shift the graph of $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units, what is the new function?\nStudent：The new function is $y = \\cos\\left(2x + \\phi - 2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$.\nTeacher：That's correct. Now, how does $\\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$ relate to the function $y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$?\nStudent：I didn't realize how to relate the cosine and sine functions, so I thought they couldn't be equated directly.\nTeacher：Can you recall any trigonometric identities that might help relate $\\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$ to a sine function?\nStudent：I remember the identity $\\sin \\theta = \\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. But at the time, I didn’t think to use it to convert one function into the other.\nTeacher：That's a good start. Let's use that identity. How can you apply $\\sin \\theta = \\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ to $\\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$?\nStudent：We can write $\\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$ as $\\sin((2x + \\phi - \\pi) + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\sin(2x + \\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nTeacher：You have correctly transformed the cosine function into a sine function. Now, how does $\\sin(2x + \\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ compare to $\\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$?\nStudent：For these two sine functions to be equal for all $x$, their phase angles must differ by a multiple of $2\\pi$. So, $2x + \\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.\nTeacher：That's a good observation. Now, can you simplify the equation $2x + \\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi$ to find $\\phi$?\nStudent：Sure! Subtract $2x$ from both sides to get: $\\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi$. So, $\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You have the right idea, but there's a small mistake in your simplification. Let's look at the equation again: $\\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi$. Can you solve for $\\phi$ correctly?\nStudent：Yes. Adding $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to both sides gives $\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You have made a small mistake in combining the terms. Let's carefully add $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to both sides of the equation $\\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi$. What do you get?\nStudent：Adding $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to both sides, we get: $\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You have correctly added $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to both sides, but you need to combine the terms on the right side. What is $\\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{2}$?\nStudent：$\\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{6} + \\frac{3\\pi}{6} = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$, so $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：That's correct. The mistake was in the final combination of the terms. You have now correctly simplified $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$. \n\nGiven the constraint $-\\pi \\leqslant \\phi < \\pi$, what value of $\\phi$ fits within this range?\nStudent：We need $-\\pi \\leq \\phi < \\pi$. If $k = 0$, $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$, which is within the interval. So, $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the value of $\\phi$ that fits within the given range. The mistake was in the final combination of the terms, which you have now corrected. \n\nIs there anything else you would like to discuss about this problem?\nStudent：No, thank you. I understand where I went wrong and how to approach such problems correctly in the future.\nTeacher：Great! I'm glad you understand the solution now. If you have any more questions or need further clarification on any topic, feel free to ask. Keep up the good work!\nStudent：I answered: \"$\\phi$ cannot be solved.\"\nTeacher：Can you explain why you thought $\\phi$ couldn't be solved?\nStudent：I thought the two functions were of different types, one being cosine and the other sine, so I couldn't see a way to set them equal directly.\nTeacher：I see. When you shift the graph of \\( y = \\cos(2x + \\phi) \\) to the right by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) units, what is the new function?\nStudent：The new function is $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$.\nTeacher：That's correct. Now, how does \\( \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi) \\) relate to the function \\( y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) \\)?\nStudent：I didn't know how to relate the cosine and sine functions, so I thought it wasn't possible to set them equal directly.\nTeacher：Can you recall any trigonometric identities that might help relate \\( \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi) \\) to a sine function?\nStudent：I know the identity $\\sin \\theta = \\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, but at the time I didn’t think to apply it to convert between sine and cosine.\nTeacher：That's a good start. Let's use that identity. How can you apply $\\sin \\theta = \\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ to $\\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$?\nStudent：We can rewrite $\\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$ as $\\sin((2x + \\phi - \\pi) + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\sin(2x + \\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nTeacher：That's correct. Now, how does $\\sin(2x + \\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ compare to $\\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$?\nStudent：For the two sine functions to be identical for all $x$, their phase angles must differ by a multiple of $2\\pi$: $2x + \\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：That's a good observation. Now, can you simplify the equation \\(2x + \\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi\\) to solve for \\(\\phi\\)?",
