    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was A. {–2, –1, 0, 1}.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined that the number 1 is included in the set M?\nStudent：I saw the interval $-3 < x < 1$ and assumed it might include 1 because 1 is at the upper boundary, but I didn't clearly consider if the interval was open or closed at 1.\nTeacher：The interval for set M is open at 1, meaning 1 is not included in M. Does this clarify the error in your solution?\nStudent：Yes, it clarifies that 1 should not be included in the answer because the interval is open at 1.\nTeacher：That's correct. The interval \\( -3 < x < 1 \\) is open, so 1 is not included in set \\( M \\). \n\nIs there anything else you would like to clarify about the problem?\nStudent：No, that makes sense. So only the integers -2, -1, and 0 from N are in the interval for M.\nTeacher：That's right. The intersection \\( M \\cap N \\) is \\(\\{-2, -1, 0\\}\\). Is there anything else you need to discuss about this problem?\nStudent：No, that helps. I understand now why the correct answer is C, $\\{-2,-1,0\\}$. Thank you!\nTeacher：You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.\nStudent：Thank you! I’ll review my approach more systematically next time to avoid this type of error.\nTeacher：You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.\nStudent：My answer was A. {–2, –1, 0, 1}.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined that the number 1 is included in the set M?\nStudent：I included 1 because I mistakenly thought the interval $-3 < x < 1$ might allow 1, without carefully checking if it was open or closed.\nTeacher：The interval for set \\( M \\) is open at 1, meaning 1 is not included. This is the mistake in your solution.\nStudent：zzc",
