    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: I couldn't find a specific value for $M+m$ because my calculations became too complex when I tried to differentiate the function directly.\n\nTeacher：Can you walk me through your approach to differentiating the function?\nStudent：Sure. I took the derivative of $f(x)$ directly using the quotient rule: I let $u=(x+1)^2+\\sin x$ and $v=x^2+1$, then found $f'(x)=\\frac{u'v-u v'}{v^2}$. However, simplifying $u'$ and $uv'$ became complicated, so I struggled to solve $f'(x)=0$.\nTeacher：I see. Can you show me your expressions for $u'$ and $v'$?\nStudent：Yes. I found $u' = 2(x+1) + \\cos x$ and $v' = 2x$. The next step was plugging these into the quotient rule, but the resulting expression was very messy and difficult to solve for critical points.\nTeacher：I understand. Let's focus on the function itself. What do you notice about the function $f(x)$ when you plug in $x$ and $-x$?\nStudent：When I plug in $x$ and $-x$, the numerator becomes $((-x)+1)^2 + \\sin(-x) = (1-x)^2 - \\sin x$, and the denominator is $(-x)^2 + 1 = x^2 + 1$. So, $f(-x) = \\frac{(1-x)^2 - \\sin x}{x^2+1}$.\nTeacher：That's a good observation. Now, can you compare $f(x)$ and $f(-x)$ and see if there is a relationship between them?\nStudent：Comparing $f(x)$ and $f(-x)$:  \n$f(-x) = \\frac{(1-x)^2 - \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$,  \nwhereas $f(x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$.  \nThey look similar except for opposing signs on $\\sin x$ and squared terms.\nTeacher：You are correct in noting the similarity. Can you add $f(x)$ and $f(-x)$ together and simplify the expression?\nStudent：Adding $f(x)$ and $f(-x)$:\n$$f(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2+1} + \\frac{(1-x)^2 - \\sin x}{x^2+1}$$\nCombine numerators:\n$$(x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2 + \\sin x - \\sin x = (x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2$$\nExpanding: $x^2 + 2x + 1 + 1 - 2x + x^2 = 2x^2 + 2$\nSo:\n$$f(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{2x^2 + 2}{x^2 + 1} = 2$$\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the expression to show that \\( f(x) + f(-x) = 2 \\). Given this, what can you conclude about the sum of the maximum and minimum values \\( M + m \\)?\nStudent：Since $f(x) + f(-x) = 2$ for all $x$, the maximum $M$ and minimum $m$ must satisfy $M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that \\( M + m = 2 \\). Well done!\nStudent：Thank you! I now see that the answer should be $M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：You're welcome! I'm glad you see it clearly now. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.\nStudent：Thank you. I originally tried to differentiate directly but got lost in the complex calculations and so didn't reach the correct answer.\nTeacher：You're welcome! It's great that you now understand the solution. If you have any more problems or need further assistance, feel free to ask.\nStudent：My answer is: I couldn't find a specific value for $M+m$ because my calculations became too complex when I tried to differentiate the function directly.\nTeacher：You have already correctly determined that \\( M + m = 2 \\). Is there a specific part of the problem or your calculations that you are still unsure about?\nStudent：No, I understand it now. My main confusion was with simplifying the calculations after differentiation, but your guidance clarified the problem for me.\nTeacher：I'm glad to hear that you now understand the problem. If you have any more questions or need further assistance with other topics, feel free to ask.\nStudent：No, thank you, I don't have any more questions about this problem for now.\nTeacher：Great! If you need help with anything else in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Keep up the good work!\nStudent：My answer is: I couldn't find a specific value for $M+m$ because my calculations became too complex when I tried to differentiate the function directly.\nTeacher：You have already correctly determined that \\( M + m = 2 \\). Is there a specific part of the problem or your calculations that you are still unsure about?\nStudent：No, I am clear about it now.

If you have any more questions or need help with other problems, feel free to ask. Keep up the good work!\nStudent：Thank you.
