    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Can you walk me through how you expanded $(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：Sure. $(1+i)^2 = (1+i) \\times (1+i) = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$.\nTeacher：That's correct. Now, can you show me how you multiplied $i$ by the result?\nStudent：Yes. $i \\times 2i = 2i^2 = 2 \\times (-1) = -2$.\nTeacher：You correctly expanded $(1+i)^2$ to $2i$. However, you then multiplied $i$ by $2i$ and concluded that the result is a real number. What type of number is $-2$?\nStudent：$-2$ is a real number.\nTeacher：You are correct, $-2$ is a real number. Can you reconsider the expression $i(1+i)^2$ and determine if it results in a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：After recalculating, $i(1+i)^2$ gives $-2$, which is a real number, not a purely imaginary number.\nTeacher：That's correct. The result of $i(1+i)^2$ is $-2$, which is a real number, not a purely imaginary number. Can you now identify the mistake in your initial choice?\nStudent：I didn't actually expand and check each option; I just picked A because it had $i$ and $(1+i)$, assuming it would be purely imaginary.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that the mistake was in not expanding and checking each option. It's important to verify each step and the final result to ensure it meets the problem's requirements.\nStudent：zzc",
