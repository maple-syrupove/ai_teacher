    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose answer D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Hello. To begin, could you please tell me the definition of an odd function?\nStudent：Sure! An odd function satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Excellent. And what is the definition of an even function?\nStudent：An even function satisfies $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Correct. To test the function in option D, let's call it $h(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$. What is the result when you evaluate $h(-x)$?\nStudent：When I evaluate $h(-x)$, I get $h(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$.\nTeacher：Excellent. Now, based on the definitions of odd and even functions, what does the expression inside the absolute value, $f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)$, simplify to?\nStudent：Based on the definitions: $f(-x) = -f(x)$ (odd) and $g(-x) = g(x)$ (even), so $f(-x) \\cdot g(-x) = -f(x) \\cdot g(x)$.\nTeacher：You are correct. So, we now have the expression $h(-x) = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\n\nWhat does this expression simplify to?\nStudent：Since the absolute value makes negatives positive, $h(-x) = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = h(x)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly shown that `h(-x) = h(x)`.\n\nHow does this result compare to the definition of an odd function you provided earlier?\nStudent：This matches the definition of an even function, not an odd function, since $h(-x) = h(x)$.\nTeacher：Your error was in your initial conclusion. You selected option D, stating that the function $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is odd. However, your analysis correctly demonstrated that this function is even.\nStudent：zzc",
