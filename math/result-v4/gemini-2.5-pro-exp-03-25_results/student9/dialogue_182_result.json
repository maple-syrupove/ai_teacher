    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is C, $(1, +\\infty)$.\nTeacher：Hello. To find the increasing interval, you first need to find the derivative. What result did you get for the derivative of the function?\nStudent：I calculated the derivative as $f'(x) = \\frac{2x-2}{x^2-2x-8}$.\nTeacher：That is the correct derivative. For a function that contains a logarithm, what is a crucial first step before you start analyzing its increase or decrease?\nStudent：I should determine the domain of the function first, making sure the argument of the logarithm is positive.\nTeacher：Excellent. And what did you determine the domain of the function to be?\nStudent：I found the domain to be $x^2-2x-8>0$, which gives $x<-2$ or $x>4$.\nTeacher：That is the correct domain. After finding the domain and the derivative, what condition did you use on the derivative to find the increasing interval?\nStudent：I set $f'(x) > 0$, so $\\frac{2x-2}{x^2-2x-8} > 0$, and then solved for $x>1$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified two key pieces of information: the domain of the function, and the interval where the derivative is positive. How did you use both of these conditions to arrive at your final answer?\nStudent：I only considered where $f'(x) > 0$, which is $x > 1$, but I did not intersect this with the function's domain.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified your mistake. You found the interval where the derivative is positive but did not take the intersection of this interval with the function's domain.\nStudent：zzc",
