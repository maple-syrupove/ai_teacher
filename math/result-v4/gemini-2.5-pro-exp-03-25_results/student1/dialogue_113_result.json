    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is A. I selected $\\{-2,-1,0,1\\}$.\nTeacher：Good, you have an answer. Let's think through the definitions.\n\nWhat does the condition $-3 < x < 1$ tell us about the numbers that can be in set M?\nStudent：It tells us that only numbers greater than -3 and less than 1 can be in set M.\nTeacher：Excellent. Now, let's consider the elements of set N.\n\nAccording to the rule for set M, which you've stated perfectly, is the number 1 an element of set M?\nStudent：No, 1 is not an element of set M because the interval is open at 1, so $x$ must be less than 1, not equal to 1.\nTeacher：You are correct that 1 is not in M. Given that, can the number 1 be an element of the intersection $M \\cap N$?\nStudent：No, the number 1 cannot be in the intersection $M \\cap N$ because 1 is not in set M.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that 1 is not in set M and therefore cannot be in the intersection. Your mistake was including the number 1 in your final answer, which contradicts your own correct reasoning.\nStudent：zzc",
