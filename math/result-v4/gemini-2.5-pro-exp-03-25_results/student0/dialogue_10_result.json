    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I wasn't able to get a specific value for $M+m$ because my differentiation got very messy and I couldn't finish the calculation.\nTeacher：The derivative does look complicated. Before you started to differentiate, did you try to rewrite the expression for $f(x)$?\nStudent：No, I didn't try to rewrite or transform $f(x)$ before differentiating it; I just worked directly with the original form.\nTeacher：I see. Let’s try rewriting it. What do you get if you expand the numerator, $(x+1)^2$?\nStudent：Expanding $(x+1)^2$ gives $x^2 + 2x + 1$.\nTeacher：Good. Now, what does the expression for $f(x)$ look like after you substitute that back into the numerator?\nStudent：After substitution, $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x + 1 + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$.\nTeacher：Excellent. Now that you have this expression, do you see a way to split the fraction into simpler parts?\nStudent：Yes, I can split it into $\\frac{x^2 + 1}{x^2 + 1} + \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$, which becomes $1 + \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$.\nTeacher：Excellent. Let's call the part you separated out $g(x) = \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$. To find the maximum and minimum of $f(x)$, what would you do now with this function $g(x)$?\nStudent：Now, I would try to find the maximum and minimum values of $g(x)$ by analyzing its behavior, perhaps by finding its critical points.\nTeacher：That is a valid method. Before you begin differentiating, have you considered what happens to the function $g(x)$ when you replace $x$ with $-x$?\nStudent：If I replace $x$ with $-x$, $g(-x) = \\frac{-2x - \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} = -g(x)$. So $g(x)$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：That's a key observation. Let the maximum value of this odd function $g(x)$ be $A$. What can you then say about its minimum value?\nStudent：Since $g(x)$ is odd, its minimum value will be $-A$ if $A$ is the maximum value.\nTeacher：That's correct. Now, how do you express $M$ and $m$, the maximum and minimum of $f(x)$, in terms of $A$?\nStudent：We have $M = 1 + A$ and $m = 1 - A$, since $f(x) = 1 + g(x)$.\nTeacher：Then what is $M+m$?\nStudent：$M + m = (1 + A) + (1 - A) = 2$.\nTeacher：That is the correct result. Based on our discussion, your error was attempting to differentiate the function in its original form. You did not simplify the expression first, which is why the calculation became too difficult to manage.\nStudent：zzc",
