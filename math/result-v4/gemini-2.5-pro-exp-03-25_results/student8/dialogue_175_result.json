    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Hello. To better understand your process, what result did you get for the part inside the parentheses, $(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：For $(1+i)^2$, I calculated $1^2 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i + (-1) = 2i$.\nTeacher：You've correctly calculated $(1+i)^2$ as $2i$.\n\nWhat did you get when you multiplied this result by the $i$ outside the parentheses for option A?\nStudent：I multiplied $i$ by $2i$ and got $2i^2 = 2(-1) = -2$.\nTeacher：Your calculation for option A resulted in -2. Could you describe the form of a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：A purely imaginary number is of the form $bi$, where $b$ is a real number and there is no real (non-$i$) part.\nTeacher：Based on your definition, is the number -2 a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：No, -2 is a real number, not a purely imaginary number.\nTeacher：You are correct. So if option A is not the answer, what did you find when you evaluated the other options, such as option C?\nStudent：For option C, $(1+i)^2$ evaluates to $2i$, which is indeed a purely imaginary number since it fits the form $bi$.\nTeacher：Your calculations for the options were accurate. Your error was in classifying the result for option A. You correctly calculated -2, but then you incorrectly identified it as a purely imaginary number.\nStudent：That’s not exactly where I went wrong. I didn’t directly classify -2 as purely imaginary; my incorrect choice was made earlier, before evaluating each expression carefully.\nTeacher：I see. Thank you for clarifying. Let's go back to the moment you first chose your answer. Before doing any detailed calculations, what was it about option A that made it seem like the correct choice to you?\nStudent：I saw the $i$ and $(1+i)$ in option A and immediately thought it would lead to something purely imaginary, since $i$ was present. I didn’t actually check by expanding or comparing the real and imaginary parts first.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining your thought process. It's very helpful.\n\nYour error was making a selection based on an assumption about the expression's appearance, rather than systematically calculating each option to confirm its properties.\nStudent：zzc",
