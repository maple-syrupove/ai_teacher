    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I wrote: “$\\phi$ cannot be solved.”\nTeacher：Let's begin. How did you represent the shift of the function to the right by π/2 units in your equation?\nStudent：I represented the right shift by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ as replacing $x$ with $x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ in $y = \\cos(2x+\\phi)$.\nTeacher：Very good. Your equation is now $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) = \\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$. How did you handle the two different trigonometric functions in this equation?\nStudent：I tried to solve it directly, but I didn't convert the cosine and sine functions into the same type.\nTeacher：I understand. When you tried to solve the equation without converting, what did you do with the arguments $(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$ and $(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$?\nStudent：I tried to compare the arguments directly, thinking if $2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, but it didn't lead to an answer.\nTeacher：What mathematical principle or identity suggests that if two functions like cosine and sine are equal, their arguments must also be equal?\nStudent：Since they are different trigonometric functions, I should have used a conversion identity, like expressing sine in terms of cosine or vice versa, instead of directly equating their arguments.\nTeacher：That's the correct principle. Which identity did you consider using to make the functions the same?\nStudent：At the time, I did not consider using any identity like $\\sin \\theta = \\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nTeacher：The specific error was your failure to apply a necessary trigonometric identity to convert the sine and cosine functions into the same form. This step is essential for solving the equation.\nStudent：zzc",
