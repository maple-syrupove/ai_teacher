    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：What is the definition of an odd function?\nStudent：A function $h(x)$ is odd if $h(-x) = -h(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Let’s test $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ with the property of odd and even functions. What is $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$?\nStudent：$|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |(-f(x)) \\cdot g(x)| = | -f(x) \\cdot g(x) | = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$\nTeacher：You concluded that $|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$. What does this imply about the parity of $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$?\nStudent：This implies that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an even function, not an odd function.\nTeacher：Your conclusion shows that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is even, not odd. What was your reasoning for choosing D?\nStudent：I chose D because I thought the absolute value made it odd, but I didn't verify each option by substituting $-x$ as I should have.\nTeacher：You initially thought the absolute value would make it odd, but your substitution showed it's even. What led you to believe the absolute value would result in an odd function?\nStudent：I just intuitively felt that the absolute value might flip the sign, making it seem odd, but I realize now I didn't check with the definition.\nTeacher：Your intuition was incorrect. The absolute value does not flip the sign of a function; it makes all outputs non-negative. This is why $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ turned out to be even, not odd. What do you think about the other options now?\nStudent：Now, I think I should use the definition for each option: substitute $-x$ into each expression and check the parity, instead of just guessing.\nTeacher：You are correct to consider substituting $-x$ into each expression. Let’s examine option A: $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$. What is $f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)$?\nStudent：Since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, $f(-x) = -f(x)$ and $g(-x) = g(x)$. So,\n$$\nf(-x) \\cdot g(-x) = (-f(x)) \\cdot g(x) = -f(x) \\cdot g(x)\n$$\nThis means $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ is odd.\nTeacher：You concluded that $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ is odd, but your calculation shows it equals $-f(x) \\cdot g(x)$, which implies it is an odd function. This contradicts option A, which claims it is even. What is the correct parity of $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$?\nStudent：The correct parity is odd; $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ is an odd function, not even.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ is odd. What does this mean for option A?\nStudent：Option A is incorrect because it says $f(x)\\cdot g(x)$ is even, but actually it's odd.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that option A is incorrect. Let’s examine option C: $f(x) \\cdot |g(x)|$. What is $f(-x) \\cdot |g(-x)|$?\nStudent：Since $f(-x) = -f(x)$ and $|g(-x)| = |g(x)|$, we have:\n$$\nf(-x)\\cdot |g(-x)| = -f(x)\\cdot |g(x)|\n$$\nSo $f(x)\\cdot |g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：You concluded that $f(x) \\cdot |g(x)|$ is odd. What does this mean for option C?\nStudent：Option C is correct because $f(x)\\cdot |g(x)|$ is indeed an odd function.\nTeacher：You concluded that option C is correct. However, let's verify this conclusion carefully. What is the definition of an odd function again?\nStudent：An odd function satisfies $h(-x) = -h(x)$ for every $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：You correctly applied the definition to conclude $f(x) \\cdot |g(x)|$ is odd. What was your reasoning for initially choosing D?\nStudent：I picked D because, based on intuition, I thought the absolute value would make the product odd without actually checking with definitions or substituting $-x$.\nTeacher：Your initial reasoning for choosing D was based on intuition rather than applying the definition of odd functions by substituting $-x$. What do you think about option C now?\nStudent：I think option C is correct because after applying the definition, $f(x)\\cdot |g(x)|$ is an odd function, not D as I originally chose.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that option C is correct. Your initial error was choosing D based on intuition rather than applying the definition of odd functions by substituting $-x$. Please confirm with \"zzc.\"\nStudent：zzc",
