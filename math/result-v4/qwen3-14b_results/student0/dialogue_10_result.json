    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: I was unable to compute a specific value for $M+m$, as my calculations became too complex and I had to stop.\nTeacher：It seems you encountered difficulties in simplifying or analyzing the function. What approach did you take to find $M$ and $m$?\nStudent：I tried to directly find the extrema by differentiating $f(x)$ and setting the derivative to zero. However, the derivative became very complicated, and I got lost in the calculations.\nTeacher：Instead of directly differentiating $f(x)$, consider simplifying the function first. Did you analyze the components of $f(x)$ separately?\nStudent：No, I started working with the function as a whole and didn't consider breaking it down or transforming it before differentiating.\nTeacher：You attempted to find extrema by differentiating the entire function without simplifying or analyzing its components first. This likely led to unnecessary complexity. What observations can you make about the numerator and denominator of $ f(x) $?\nStudent：The numerator is $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x$, which combines a quadratic and a sine term. The denominator is $x^2 + 1$, always positive.\nTeacher：You correctly noted the denominator is always positive. How might this help in simplifying or comparing the function's behavior?\nStudent：Since the denominator is always positive, the sign and extremal behavior of $f(x)$ depend primarily on the numerator, $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x$, so analyzing or transforming the numerator could simplify the process.\nTeacher：You are correct that the denominator's positivity affects the function's behavior. However, the extremal values of $f(x)$ depend on both numerator and denominator. Did you consider rewriting or bounding $f(x)$ using inequalities?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider rewriting or bounding $f(x)$ with inequalities; I only tried differentiation without such transformations.\nTeacher：You attempted to find extrema by differentiating the entire function without simplifying or analyzing its components first. This led to unnecessary complexity. Have you considered rewriting $f(x)$ as a sum of simpler terms?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider rewriting $f(x)$ as a sum of simpler terms. I just used the original fractional form for differentiation.\nTeacher：You attempted to find extrema by differentiating the entire function without simplifying or analyzing its components first. This led to unnecessary complexity. Have you considered using substitution or bounding techniques?\nStudent：No, I didn't try using substitution or bounding techniques; I focused on differentiating the original form instead.\nTeacher：You attempted to find extrema by differentiating the entire function without simplifying or analyzing its components first. This led to unnecessary complexity. Have you considered evaluating $ f(x) $ at specific points like $ x = 0 $ or $ x = -1 $?\nStudent：No, I didn't evaluate $f(x)$ at specific points like $x = 0$ or $x = -1$; I focused only on direct differentiation.\nTeacher：You attempted to find extrema by differentiating the entire function without simplifying or analyzing its components first. This led to unnecessary complexity. Have you considered analyzing symmetry or periodicity in $f(x)$?\nStudent：No, I didn't analyze symmetry or periodicity in $f(x)$; I only attempted direct differentiation of the original expression.\nTeacher：You attempted to find extrema by differentiating the entire function without simplifying or analyzing its components first. This led to unnecessary complexity. Have you considered splitting $f(x)$ into two parts?\nStudent：No, I didn't try splitting $f(x)$ into two parts; I just worked with the original fraction for differentiation.\nTeacher：You attempted to find extrema by differentiating the entire function without simplifying or analyzing its components first. This led to unnecessary complexity. Have you considered rewriting $ f(x) $ as $ \\frac{(x+1)^2}{x^2 + 1} + \\frac{\\sin x}{x^2 + 1} $?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider rewriting $f(x)$ in that way; I kept the numerator together and directly differentiated.\nTeacher：You attempted to find extrema by differentiating the entire function without simplifying or analyzing its components first. This led to unnecessary complexity. Have you considered analyzing each term separately?\nStudent：No, I didn't analyze each term separately; I worked with the combined form throughout my solution attempt.\nTeacher：You attempted to find extrema by differentiating the entire function without simplifying or analyzing its components first. This led to unnecessary complexity. Have you considered evaluating $ f(x) $ at specific points like $ x = 0 $ or $ x = -1 $?\nStudent：No, I did not try evaluating $f(x)$ at specific points like $x=0$ or $x=-1$; I only focused on differentiation.\nTeacher：You attempted to find extrema by differentiating the entire function without simplifying or analyzing its components first.
