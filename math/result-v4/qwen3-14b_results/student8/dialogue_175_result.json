    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Let's examine your choice. What is the expansion of $(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：The expansion of $(1+i)^2$ is $1^2 + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot i + i^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2$. Since $i^2 = -1$, it becomes $1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$.\nTeacher：Then, what is $i \\cdot (2i)$?\nStudent：$i \\cdot (2i) = 2i^2 = 2 \\times (-1) = -2$.\nTeacher：Your calculation shows that option A simplifies to $-2$, which is a real number, not a purely imaginary one. What is the definition of a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：A purely imaginary number is a complex number whose real part is zero and whose imaginary part is nonzero.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that option A results in a real number. Let's check another option. What is the expansion of $(1+i)^2$ in option C?\nStudent：The expansion of $(1+i)^2$ in option C is $1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$.\nTeacher：You've correctly expanded $(1+i)^2$ to $2i$. What is the real part of this result?\nStudent：The real part of $2i$ is $0$.\nTeacher：You've correctly identified that the real part of $2i$ is $0$. Then why did you choose option A instead of option C?\nStudent：I saw the presence of $i$ and $(1+i)$ in option A and assumed it would be purely imaginary, without actually calculating or comparing with option C.\nTeacher：You assumed the result would be purely imaginary based on the presence of $i$ and $(1+i)$, rather than calculating the actual result. This led you to incorrectly select option A instead of C. Is this clear?\nStudent：zzc",
