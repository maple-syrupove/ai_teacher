I chose $\\{-2,-1,0,1\\}$.\n教师：What does the set $M=\\{x \\mid -3 < x < 1, x \\in R\\}$ represent in terms of boundaries and values?\n学生：Set $M$ represents all real numbers greater than $-3$ and less than $1$, not including $-3$ and $1$ themselves.\n教师：How does the set $N=\\{-3,-2,-1,0,1\\}$ compare with the boundaries and values you described for set $M$?\n学生：Set $N$ contains five integers: $-3, -2, -1, 0, 1$. Among these, I need to check which ones fall strictly between $-3$ and $1$ (not including $-3$ and $1$ themselves).\n教师：Which numbers from set $N=\\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1\\}$ strictly fall within the boundaries of set $M=\\{x \\mid -3 < x < 1\\}$, specifically between $-3$ and $1$, excluding near boundaries?\n学生：The numbers from $N$ that strictly fall within $M$ are $-2$, $-1$, and $0$.\n教师：The error lies in including $1$. $1$ is not strictly within the boundaries of $M$ because $M$ only includes numbers less than $1$.\n学生：zzc",
