    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer was: $k > 0$.\n教师：Let's think about monotonicity. What does it mean for $f'(x)$ on the given interval if the function is monotonically increasing?\n学生：It means that $f'(x)$ should be greater than or equal to $0$ for all $x > 1$.\n教师：Correct. To explore the derivative, what is $f'(x)$ for the function $f(x) = kx - \\ln x$?\n学生：The derivative is $f'(x) = k - \\dfrac{1}{x}$.\n教师：What condition must $f'(x) = k - \\dfrac{1}{x}$ satisfy for $f(x)$ to be increasing on $(1, +\\infty)$?\n学生：It must satisfy $k - \\dfrac{1}{x} \\geq 0$ for all $x > 1$.\n教师：You mentioned that \\( k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x > 1 \\). Have you considered the specific behavior of the function as \\( x \\rightarrow 1^+ \\)?\n学生：I didn't consider the specific behavior as $x \\to 1^+$; I just looked at the general form for $x > 1$.\n教师：When evaluating monotonic behavior on an interval, consider the limit of \\( k - \\frac{1}{x} \\) as \\( x \\to 1^+ \\). For \\( f(x) \\) to be increasing from \\( x=1 \\), its derivative must be non-negative at the boundary of the interval.\n学生：So, as $x \\to 1^+$, $f'(x) = k - 1$, so we need $k - 1 \\geq 0$, which gives $k \\geq 1$.\n教师：The error is in concluding $k > 0$ as the range, not considering the behavior at $x \\to 1^+$.\n学生：zzc",
