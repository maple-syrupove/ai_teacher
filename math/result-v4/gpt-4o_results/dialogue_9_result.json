What steps did you take?\n学生：I directly differentiated $f(x)$ and got $f'(x)=\\frac{2x-2}{x^2-2x-8}$. Then, I solved $f'(x)>0$ and got $x>1$.\n教师：Have you considered checking the sign of the denominator in the derivative expression before solving the inequality $f'(x) > 0$?\n学生：I didn't check the sign of the denominator specifically; I just solved $2x-2>0$ and got $x>1$.\n教师：Your error lies in not considering the critical points where the expression \\( x^2 - 2x - 8 \\) changes sign, which affects the interval where \\( f'(x) > 0 \\).\n学生：zzc",
