    "history_prompt": "\n学生：$\\phi$ cannot be solved.\n教师：What steps did you take to determine the transformation needed for the graphs to coincide?\n学生：I compared the functions and noticed they were in different forms, so I tried to match their variables directly but couldn't relate them, which made me think $\\phi$ couldn't be solved.\n教师：What do you notice about the relationship between sine and cosine functions when shifted by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$? How does this relate to your approach?\n学生：I know that shifting cosine by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ can relate it to sine, but I didn't recall the exact formula connecting them, so I didn't use any transformation based on that.\n教师：What happens to a cosine function if you apply a phase shift of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\)? How might this shift align it with a sine function directly?\n学生：If you shift a cosine function to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, it can turn into a sine function, but I didn't remember how to write that as a formula, so I didn't apply it.\n教师：Did you recognize that shifting the cosine function by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) to the right transforms it into a sine function? Consider what transformation equations you might have intended to use.\n学生：I realized there’s a connection, but I wasn’t able to recall or apply the precise transformation equation between cosine and sine.\n教师：It seems you may have overlooked that when \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\) is shifted to \\(\\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\), it transforms to \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\).\n学生：zzc",
