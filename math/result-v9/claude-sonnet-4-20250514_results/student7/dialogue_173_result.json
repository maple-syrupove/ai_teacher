    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. $A \\cap B=\\varnothing$\nTeacher：I see you chose option B. Let me understand your reasoning better.\n\nFirst, can you tell me what set B represents? What values of x satisfy the inequality 3 - 2x > 0?\nStudent：Set B represents the values of x making 3 - 2x > 0.\nTeacher：Good. Now, can you solve that inequality 3 - 2x > 0 for me? What specific range of x values does this give you?\nStudent：Solving 3 - 2x > 0, we get 3 > 2x, so x < 3/2. So B = {x | x < 3/2}.\nTeacher：Excellent! You correctly found that B = {x | x < 3/2}.\n\nNow, given that A = {x | x < 2} and B = {x | x < 3/2}, what would be the intersection A ∩ B?\n\nRemember that intersection means the values that belong to BOTH sets.\nStudent：A ∩ B would be the set of x such that x < 2 and x < 3/2.\nTeacher：Exactly right! So if x must satisfy both x < 2 AND x < 3/2, which condition is more restrictive?\n\nIn other words, what values of x satisfy both inequalities simultaneously?\nStudent：The more restrictive condition is x < 3/2, so x must satisfy x < 3/2.\nTeacher：Perfect! So A ∩ B = {x | x < 3/2}.\n\nLooking at your original answer of option B (A ∩ B = ∅), I can see your error: you incorrectly concluded that the intersection is empty when it actually contains all values less than 3/2.\nStudent：zzc",
