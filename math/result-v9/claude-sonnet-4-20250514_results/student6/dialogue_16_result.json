    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：φ 不能求。\nTeacher：I see you think φ cannot be determined. Let me ask you this: when we shift the graph of y = cos(2x + φ) to the right by π/2 units, what is the equation of the resulting function?\nStudent：y = cos(2(x - π/2) + φ)\nTeacher：Good, that's correct. Now can you simplify cos(2(x - π/2) + φ)? What does 2(x - π/2) equal?\nStudent：2(x - π/2) = 2x - π\nTeacher：Excellent! So the shifted function becomes y = cos(2x - π + φ). Now, this shifted function equals y = sin(2x + π/3). \n\nCan you tell me what trigonometric identity relates cosine and sine functions?\nStudent：$\\sin \\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\dfrac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$\nTeacher：Perfect! You know that sin θ = cos(θ - π/2).\n\nNow, we have cos(2x - π + φ) = sin(2x + π/3).\n\nUsing your identity, can you rewrite sin(2x + π/3) in terms of cosine?\nStudent：$\\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\cos\\left((2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$\nTeacher：Great! Now simplify the expression inside the cosine. What does $(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ equal?\nStudent：$2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}$\nTeacher：Excellent! So we have:\ncos(2x - π + φ) = cos(2x - π/6)\n\nSince these cosine functions are equal for all x, what must be true about their arguments?\nStudent：Their arguments must differ by a multiple of $2\\pi$, so $2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer.\nTeacher：Excellent reasoning! Now simplify that equation. What do you get when you subtract 2x from both sides and solve for φ?\nStudent：$-\\pi + \\phi = -\\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$，所以$\\phi = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$。\nTeacher：Good work on the algebra! Now you have φ = π - π/6 + 2kπ.\n\nCan you simplify π - π/6? And then, given the constraint that -π ≤ φ < π, which value of k should you choose?\nStudent：$\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$。 当 $k = 0$ 时，$\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$，符合 $-\\pi \\leqslant \\phi < \\pi$ 的条件。\nTeacher：Perfect! You correctly found that φ = 5π/6 when k = 0, and this value satisfies the given constraint -π ≤ φ < π.\n\nYour solution is completely correct. Well done on working through this step-by-step!\nStudent：Thank you, teacher.\nTeacher：You're welcome! You did excellent work systematically applying the trigonometric identity and algebraic manipulation to find the correct answer. Your step-by-step approach was very thorough and accurate.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher.\nTeacher：You're very welcome! I'm proud of how you persevered through this problem and applied the concepts correctly. Keep up the great work with your trigonometry studies!\nStudent：φ 不能求。\nTeacher：I notice you're repeating your initial statement that φ cannot be determined. However, we just worked through the complete solution together and found φ = 5π/6.\n\nWhat specifically makes you think φ cannot be found? Is there a particular step in our solution that concerns you?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：I understand you're feeling uncertain. Let me ask you this: When we have two cosine functions that are equal for all values of x, like cos(2x - π + φ) = cos(2x - π/6), what does this tell us about the relationship between their arguments?\nStudent：It tells us that their arguments must differ by a multiple of $2\\pi$: $2x - \\pi + φ = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$ where $k$ is an integer.\nTeacher：Exactly right! And when you solve that equation, you get φ = 5π/6 + 2kπ. \n\nWith the constraint -π ≤ φ < π, we choose k = 0, giving φ = 5π/6.\n\nSo φ can definitely be determined. What made you think it couldn't be found?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：I see you're uncertain about why φ can be determined. Let me ask: Do you understand that when two functions are identical (like after the shift), their expressions must be equivalent?\n\nSince cos(2x - π + φ) = sin(2x + π/3) for all x values, this creates a specific relationship that allows us to solve for φ uniquely.\nStudent：Yes, I understand. Since the shifted cosine function and the sine function are identical for all x, their arguments must have a constant relationship, allowing us to solve for φ.\nTeacher：Excellent! You've grasped the key concept perfectly. When two trigonometric functions are identical for all x values, we can indeed determine any unknown parameters by equating their expressions.\n\nSo you now understand that φ can be determined and equals 5π/6. Great work overcoming your initial uncertainty!\nStudent：Thank you, teacher.\nTeacher：You're very welcome! I'm glad we could work through your uncertainty together. You demonstrated excellent understanding of the underlying mathematical principles - that identical functions must have equivalent expressions, which allows us to solve for unknown parameters like φ.\n\nKeep applying this logical reasoning in future problems!\nStudent：φ 不能求。\nTeacher：I notice you keep returning to saying φ cannot be determined, even after we solved it together multiple times and you showed understanding of the solution.\n\nCan you tell me: what specific mathematical principle or step makes you believe that φ is impossible to find in this problem?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：I understand you're struggling with this concept. Let me approach this differently.\n\nYou keep saying φ cannot be determined, but we have a concrete equation: cos(2x - π + φ) = cos(2x - π/6).\n\nCan you explain why you think this equation has no solution for φ, when we can clearly see the arguments differ only by constants?\nStudent：No, I can't explain why this equation would have no solution for φ.\nTeacher：Perfect! You just acknowledged that the equation cos(2x - π + φ) = cos(2x - π/6) does have a solution for φ.\n\nSo if this equation has a solution, then φ can indeed be determined. Your original statement \"φ 不能求\" (φ cannot be found) is incorrect.\n\nThe equation clearly allows us to solve for φ = 5π/6.",
