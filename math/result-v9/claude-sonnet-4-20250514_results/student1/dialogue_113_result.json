    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: $\\{-3,-2,-1,0,1\\}$.\nTeacher：Looking at your answer, you selected all elements from set N. Let me ask: what does the intersection M ∩ N represent, and what condition must an element satisfy to be in this intersection?\nStudent：The intersection $M \\cap N$ represents all elements that belong to both $M$ and $N$ at the same time. An element must be a member of both sets.\nTeacher：Good! Now, let's examine set M more carefully. You said M ∩ N = {-3,-2,-1,0,1}. \n\nLooking at M = {x | -3 < x < 1, x ∈ R}, what does the condition \"-3 < x < 1\" tell us about which values can be in set M?\nStudent：It means that only numbers greater than -3 and less than 1 can be in set M.\nTeacher：Exactly! So if x must be greater than -3 to be in set M, let me ask you this: Is the number -3 itself greater than -3?\nStudent：No, -3 is not greater than -3.\nTeacher：Perfect! Since -3 is not greater than -3, it cannot be in set M. Therefore, -3 cannot be in the intersection M ∩ N.\n\nYour error is including -3 in your answer when -3 does not satisfy the condition -3 < x < 1 required for membership in set M.\nStudent：zzc",
