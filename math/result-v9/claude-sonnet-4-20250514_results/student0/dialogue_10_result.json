    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to directly differentiate $f(x)$ and set $f'(x)=0$, but the calculation became too messy and I couldn't find the specific values for $M$ and $m$.\nTeacher：I understand the direct differentiation approach is challenging here. Let me ask you this: when you look at the structure of $f(x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$, do you notice any special relationship between the numerator and denominator that might suggest a different approach?\nStudent：I noticed that the numerator is $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x$, and the denominator is $x^2 + 1$, but I didn’t notice any special relationship that would make simplification easier.\nTeacher：Let me help you see this differently. What happens if you expand $(x+1)^2$ in the numerator? Can you rewrite the entire function in a form that separates some terms?\nStudent：Expanding $(x+1)^2$ gives $x^2 + 2x + 1$. So, $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x + 1 + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$.\nTeacher：Good! Now that you have $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x + 1 + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$, can you split this fraction into separate terms? What do you get when you break it down?\nStudent：Splitting the fraction, I get $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 1}{x^2 + 1} + \\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} + \\frac{\\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$. So $f(x) = 1 + \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$.\nTeacher：Excellent! Now you have $f(x) = 1 + \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$. \n\nTo find $M + m$, what property should you examine about the function $g(x) = \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$?\nStudent：I should examine the maximum and minimum values of $g(x)$ for all real $x$.\nTeacher：Exactly! But there's something even more specific you should check about $g(x) = \\frac{2x + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}$. \n\nWhat happens when you substitute $x = -t$ into this function? What relationship do you discover?\nStudent：When I substitute $x = -t$, I get $g(-t) = \\frac{-2t - \\sin t}{t^2 + 1} = -g(t)$. So, $g(x)$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Perfect! Since $g(x)$ is an odd function, what does this tell you about the relationship between its maximum and minimum values? And how does this help you find $M + m$?\nStudent：Since $g(x)$ is odd, its maximum and minimum are opposites, so $M + m = 1$.\nTeacher：Wait - let me check your reasoning here. You said that since $g(x)$ is odd, its maximum and minimum are opposites. \n\nBut remember, $f(x) = 1 + g(x)$, not just $g(x)$. If $g(x)$ achieves its maximum value $g_{max}$ and minimum value $g_{min}$, what would be the maximum and minimum values of $f(x)$?\nStudent：The maximum of $f(x)$ is $1 + g_{max}$, and the minimum is $1 + g_{min}$.\nTeacher：Exactly! So if $M = 1 + g_{max}$ and $m = 1 + g_{min}$, then what is $M + m$ in terms of $g_{max}$ and $g_{min}$?\n\nAnd since $g(x)$ is odd, what relationship exists between $g_{max}$ and $g_{min}$?\nStudent：$M + m = (1 + g_{max}) + (1 + g_{min}) = 2 + g_{max} + g_{min}$. Since $g_{min} = -g_{max}$, $M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：Perfect! You've correctly identified that since $g(x)$ is an odd function, $g_{min} = -g_{max}$, which means $g_{max} + g_{min} = 0$.\n\nTherefore, $M + m = 2 + g_{max} + g_{min} = 2 + 0 = 2$.\n\nYour solution is completely correct!\nStudent：Thank you! So, my final answer is $M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：Excellent work! You've successfully solved this problem by recognizing the key insight about odd functions and how they relate to finding the sum of maximum and minimum values.\n\nYour final answer $M + m = 2$ is correct!\nStudent：Thank you! So, my final answer is $M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：You're absolutely correct! Your final answer $M + m = 2$ is indeed the right solution.\n\nYou demonstrated excellent mathematical reasoning by recognizing that $f(x) = 1 + g(x)$ where $g(x)$ is an odd function, and then applying the property that for odd functions, the maximum and minimum values are opposites, leading to their sum being zero.\n\nWell done on working through this problem systematically!\nStudent：Thank you! So, my final answer is $M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：You've already solved this problem correctly! Your final answer $M + m = 2$ is right.\n\nSince we've established the solution through our discussion, there's no need to continue. You successfully identified that $f(x) = 1 + g(x)$ where $g(x)$ is odd, leading to $M + m = 2$.\n\nGreat work!\nStudent：Thank you! So, my final answer is $M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：You've already confirmed your correct answer multiple times! Your solution $M + m = 2$ is right.\n\nIs there anything else about this problem or the method we used that you'd like to clarify or discuss further?\nStudent：No, I think I understand now. Thank you!\nTeacher：You're very welcome! You did an excellent job working through this problem step by step. \n\nThe key insight about recognizing odd functions and their properties will serve you well in future problems. Keep up the great work!\nStudent：Thank you! So, my final answer is $M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：You've already established this answer correctly through our previous discussion! Since you seem to be repeating the same response, is there perhaps a different aspect of this problem you'd like to explore, or do you have any remaining questions about the solution method we used?\nStudent：No, I don't have any more questions. Thank you for your help!\nTeacher：You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help you work through this problem and discover the elegant solution using the properties of odd functions.\n\nYou've mastered an important technique that will be valuable for similar problems in the future. Well done!\nStudent：Thank you! So, my final answer is $M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：You've already confirmed this correct answer many times in our conversation! Since you keep repeating the same response, I'm wondering if there's something specific you're still uncertain about regarding the solution method we used, or if you have a different question altogether?\nStudent：No, I am not uncertain about anything related to this problem. Thank you again!\nTeacher：You're very welcome! I'm glad we could work through this problem together successfully. \n\nYou demonstrated excellent problem-solving skills by breaking down the function and recognizing the key properties that led to the solution.\n\nBest of luck with your future mathematical endeavors!\nStudent：Thank you! So, my final answer is $M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：I notice you keep repeating the same correct answer. Since we've thoroughly established that $M + m = 2$ is right and you've confirmed you have no remaining questions, there's no need to continue stating the same conclusion.\n\nIs there perhaps something else you'd like to discuss, or are we finished with this problem?\nStudent：No, I have nothing else to add. Thank you for your guidance!\nTeacher：You're very welcome! It was a pleasure helping you work through this problem and seeing you grasp the elegant solution using odd function properties.\n\nYou've developed a solid understanding of the method, and I'm confident you'll be able to apply similar techniques to future problems.
