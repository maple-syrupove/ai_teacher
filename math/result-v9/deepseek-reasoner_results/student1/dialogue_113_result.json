    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: $\\{-3,-2,-1,0,1\\}$.\nTeacher：Considering the sets M and N, let's focus on the definition of M: M = {x | -3 < x < 1, x ∈ R}. Now, examine the element -3 from N. Does -3 satisfy the condition -3 < x < 1? Why or why not?\nStudent：-3 does not satisfy -3 < x < 1 because -3 is not greater than -3.\nTeacher：Now, consider the element 1 from set N. Does 1 satisfy the condition -3 < x < 1 for set M? Why or why not?\nStudent：1 does not satisfy -3 < x < 1 because 1 is not less than 1.\nTeacher：Your initial answer included the elements -3 and 1, which do not satisfy the strict inequality -3 < x < 1 for set M.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：When forming the intersection, did you verify the membership in M for every element of N?\nStudent：I checked if each element of N was between -3 and 1, but I included all of them without properly excluding -3 and 1.\nTeacher：Your mistake was including -3 and 1 in the intersection, as they do not satisfy the strict inequality defining M.\nStudent：zzc",
