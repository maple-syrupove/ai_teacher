    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: $k > 0$.\nTeacher：To identify your error, let's test your condition. If k=0.5, what is the sign of f'(x) at x=1.5? Remember f'(x)=k-1/x.\nStudent：If $k=0.5$ and $x=1.5$, then $f'(1.5)=0.5-\\frac{1}{1.5}=0.5-\\frac{2}{3}\\approx0.5-0.67=-0.17$. So it's negative.\nTeacher：Your initial condition $k>0$ is insufficient. Near $x=1$, $f'(x)$ becomes negative when $k<1$.\nStudent：Oh, I see. Then the value for $k$ should be $k \\geq 1$.\nTeacher：Considering your revised answer \\(k \\geq 1\\), let's verify consistency. For \\(k = 1\\), compute \\(f'(x)\\) at \\(x = 1.1\\). What is the result?\nStudent：For $k=1$ and $x=1.1$, $f'(1.1)=1-\\frac{1}{1.1}\\approx1-0.909=0.091$. So it's positive.\nTeacher：Your initial answer \\(k > 0\\) is insufficient because when \\(0 < k < 1\\), there exist points near \\(x = 1\\) where \\(f'(x) < 0\\).\nStudent：zzc",
