    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by directly differentiating $f(x)$ and solving $f'(x)=0$, but the derivative became very complicated and I couldn't proceed. I wasn't able to find a specific value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：Have you considered transforming the function $f(x)$ into a more convenient form? Notice that $f(x)$ can be rewritten. How might this new form help in finding the relationship between $M$ and $m$?\nStudent：No, I didn't try to transform $f(x)$. I just started calculating the derivative directly, thinking I could solve for the extrema that way.\nTeacher：Your mistake was assuming that directly differentiating to find extrema was the only approach. Transforming the function first, like splitting it into simpler parts, could have made finding the relationship between $M$ and $m$ much easier. \nStudent：zzc",
