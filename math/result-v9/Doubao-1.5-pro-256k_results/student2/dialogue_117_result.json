    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $\\frac{1}{2}$\nTeacher：Can you recall the double - angle formula for cosine and how it relates to $\\cos ^{2}\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$? Also, how does $\\sin2\\alpha$ factor into this?\nStudent：The double-angle formula for cosine is $\\cos2A = 1 - 2\\sin^2A$. I thought since $\\sin2\\alpha$ is given, I could use it with $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$.\nTeacher：You seem to be misdirected in choosing the formula. The relevant formula here should be $\\cos2\\beta = 2\\cos^{2}\\beta - 1$. And for $\\beta=\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}$, you need to transform it correctly. What do you think about this?\nStudent：I thought I could just use the value of $\\sin 2\\alpha$ directly for $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$.\nTeacher：Your error is that you wrongly assumed you could directly use the value of $\\sin 2\\alpha$ for $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$. There is no such direct connection.\nStudent：zzc",
