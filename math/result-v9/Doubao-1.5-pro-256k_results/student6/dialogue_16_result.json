    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：What do you think the rule is for shifting the graph of the function \\(y = \\cos(2x+\\phi)\\) to the right by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) units? How did you apply this rule in this problem?\nStudent：If we shift the graph of \\(y = \\cos(2x+\\phi)\\) to the right by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), it becomes \\(y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi) = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)\\).\nTeacher：Good. Now, how did you relate \\(\\cos(2x - \\pi+\\phi)\\) to \\(\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})\\)? What identity or step did you take next?\nStudent：I tried to set \\(\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) = \\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})\\), but I couldn't find a way to connect them, so I stopped there.\nTeacher：You should use the trigonometric identity \\(\\cos(A-\\pi)=-\\cos A\\) and then the co - function identity \\(\\cos\\alpha=\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\) to transform \\(\\cos(2x - \\pi+\\phi)\\) to a form comparable with \\(\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})\\).\nStudent：zzc",
