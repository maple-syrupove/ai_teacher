    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Recall the definitions of odd and even functions. For an odd function $f(x)$, $f(-x)= -f(x)$ and for an even function $g(x)$, $g(-x)=g(x)$. Now, consider the property of the absolute - value function. What is the sign of $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)|$?\nStudent：The sign is always non-negative, since absolute value is always greater than or equal to $0$.\nTeacher：You're focusing on the non - negativity of the absolute value. But to determine if a function is odd or even, you need to check the relationship between $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)|$ and $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$. What should the relationship be for an odd function?\nStudent：For an odd function, $h(-x) = -h(x)$ must hold for all $x$ in the domain.\nTeacher：So, for $h(x)=|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$, substitute $-x$. What do you get for $h(-x)$? Compare it with $-h(x)$. Notice that you might be making an incorrect assumption about how the odd - function property applies to a function with an absolute - value.\nStudent：If I substitute $-x$, I get $h(-x)=|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)|=|-f(x)\\cdot g(x)|=|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$, so $h(-x)=h(x)$. That means it’s an even function, not odd.\nTeacher：You initially misidentified the function $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ as odd instead of even. You failed to correctly apply the definitions of odd and even functions to this composite function.\nStudent：zzc",
