    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: $k > 0$\nTeacher：How did you get $k>0$? When dealing with a function's monotonicity, we usually consider its derivative. What's the derivative of $f(x)=kx - \\ln x$ and how did you use it in your solution?\nStudent：The derivative is $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}$. I wanted $f'(x) \\geq 0$, so I wrote $k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0$, then $k \\geq \\frac{1}{x}$. Since $x > 1$, I thought $k > 0$ would work.\nTeacher：The error is that when $x>1$, the range of $\\frac{1}{x}$ is $(0,1)$. You can't just say $k > 0$. The correct approach is to find the maximum value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ on the interval $(1,+\\infty)$ and set $k$ greater than or equal to that. \nStudent：I see. So, should I set $k \\geq 1$, since the maximum of $\\frac{1}{x}$ for $x > 1$ is $1$?\nTeacher：You've now corrected your mistake. Well done. If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask. If you're done, please reply with \"zzc\".\nStudent：zzc",
