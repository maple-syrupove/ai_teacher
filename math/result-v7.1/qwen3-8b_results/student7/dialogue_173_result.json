    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：我选B，A∩B=∅。\nTeacher：Your answer suggests that sets A and B have no elements in common. Let me ask: What is the solution set for the inequality defining set B?\nStudent：解不等式 3-2x>0，得到 x<1.5。 所以 B={x | x<1.5}。\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the solution set for set B. Now, let me ask: What is the relationship between the elements of set A and set B?\nStudent：A 的元素都是 x<2，B 的元素都是 x<1.5。所以它们都有 x<1.5 的部分。\nTeacher：Your reasoning suggests that there is an overlap between sets A and B. Let me ask: If both sets contain elements less than 1.5, what does that imply about their intersection?\nStudent：那它们的交集就是 x<1.5。\nTeacher：Your conclusion implies that the intersection of A and B is non-empty. However, you initially selected B, claiming the intersection is empty. This is a contradiction. Let me ask: If the intersection is non-empty, why did you choose B?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：Your initial selection of B was based on a misunderstanding. The intersection of A and B is non-empty, as both sets contain elements less than 1.5. Therefore, the correct answer is not B.\nStudent：zzc",
