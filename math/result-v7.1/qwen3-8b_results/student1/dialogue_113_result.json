    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: M ∩ N = {−3,−2,−1,0,1}\nTeacher：Your answer includes −3 and 1, which are not in the set $ M $. Recall that $ M $ is defined as $ \\{x \\mid -3 < x < 1, x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\} $. Therefore, the elements of $ M \\cap N $ must satisfy both conditions: being in $ N $ and lying strictly between −3 and 1.\nStudent：Oh, I see. So do I only need to include the numbers from $N$ that are greater than $-3$ and less than $1$?\nTeacher：Yes, that is correct. However, your answer still includes −3 and 1, which are not in $ M $. You must exclude them.\nStudent：So, should $M \\cap N$ just be the numbers from $N$ that are strictly between $-3$ and $1$?\nTeacher：Yes, that is correct. You should exclude −3 and 1 from your answer. What is the correct set?\nStudent：The correct set is {−2,−1,0}.\nTeacher：C. $\\{-2,-1,0\\}$ is the correct answer. You have now identified and corrected your mistake.\nStudent：Okay, my answer is: M ∩ N = {−3,−2,−1,0,1}\nTeacher：Your answer includes −3 and 1, which are not in the set $ M $.

However, your answer still includes −3 and 1, which are not in $ M $. You must exclude them.\nStudent：So, the numbers I should pick are just those in $N$ that are strictly between $-3$ and $1$?\nTeacher：Yes, that is correct. What numbers in $ N $ are strictly between $-3$ and $1$?\nStudent：The numbers in $N$ that are strictly between $-3$ and $1$ are $-2$, $-1$, and $0$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the elements of $ M \\cap N $. Your mistake was initially including $-3$ and $1$, which are not in $ M $.
