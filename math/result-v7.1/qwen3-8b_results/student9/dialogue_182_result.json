Have you considered the domain of the function?\nStudent：No, I haven't considered the domain.\nTeacher：The domain of $ f(x) = \\ln(x^2 - 2x - 8) $ is determined by $ x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0 $. Have you solved this inequality?\nStudent：No, I haven't solved that inequality yet.\nTeacher：The inequality $ x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0 $ factors as $ (x - 4)(x + 2) > 0 $. Have you analyzed the sign of this expression?\nStudent：No, I haven't analyzed its sign yet.\nTeacher：The inequality $ (x - 4)(x + 2) > 0 $ holds when $ x < -2 $ or $ x > 4 $. Have you considered how this affects the domain of the function?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider how that affects the domain.\nTeacher：The domain of the function is $ (-\\infty, -2) \\cup (4, +\\infty) $. Have you considered how this impacts the interval where the function is monotonically increasing?\nStudent：No, I haven't considered how the domain impacts the monotonically increasing interval.\nTeacher：The function's domain is $ (-\\infty, -2) \\cup (4, +\\infty) $. Have you analyzed the derivative of $ f(x) $ within this domain to determine where it is increasing?\nStudent：I only calculated the derivative and found $f'(x)>0$ gives $x>1$, but I didn't restrict $x$ to the domain.\nTeacher：The error is not restricting the derivative's solution $ x > 1 $ to the domain of the function $ (-\\infty, -2) \\cup (4, +\\infty) $.\nStudent：zzc",
