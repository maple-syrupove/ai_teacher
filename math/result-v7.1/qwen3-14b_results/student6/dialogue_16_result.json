    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I don’t know how to solve for $\\phi$ because the forms are different.\nTeacher：What is the relationship between sine and cosine functions that might help you rewrite one in terms of the other?\nStudent：$\\sin \\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nTeacher：Good. How does shifting the cosine function to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units affect its argument?\nStudent：Shifting to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ replaces $x$ with $x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so the argument becomes $2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi$.\nTeacher：You said the argument becomes $2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi$. What is this expression simplified?\nStudent：It simplifies to $2x - \\pi + \\phi$.\nTeacher：Yes, that simplification is correct. What does this expression represent after the shift?\nStudent：It represents the new argument of the cosine function after the shift, so the function becomes $y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：You stated the function becomes $y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$ after the shift. What is the relationship between this and the given sine function?\nStudent：I didn't establish a relationship between them, so I couldn't proceed to form an equation for $\\phi$.\nTeacher：You have the shifted cosine function and the sine function. What must be true about their arguments for the graphs to coincide?\nStudent：Their arguments must differ by a multiple of $2\\pi$; that is, $2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ plus a multiple of $2\\pi$.\nTeacher：You are correct that the arguments must differ by a multiple of $2\\pi$, but you missed considering the phase shift identity between sine and cosine. What is the relationship between $\\cos(\\theta)$ and $\\sin(\\theta)$ in terms of phase shifts?\nStudent：$\\cos(\\theta) = \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the phase shift identity. However, you did not apply it to equate the shifted cosine function with the given sine function. What does this identity imply about the arguments of the two functions?\nStudent：It implies that the argument of the cosine plus $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ should match the argument of the sine function.\nTeacher：You are correct that the argument of the cosine function plus $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ should match the argument of the sine function. What is the equation you get when you apply this relationship to your shifted cosine function?\nStudent：$2x - \\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly set up the equation, but you did not simplify it to solve for $\\phi$. What is the next step?\nStudent：The next step is to subtract $2x$ from both sides and solve for $\\phi$.\nTeacher：Subtracting $2x$ from both sides gives $-\\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$. What is the simplified form of the left side?\nStudent：The left side simplifies to $\\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：That simplification is incorrect. What is $-\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}$?\nStudent：$-\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified $-\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. What is the equation now?\nStudent：The equation is $\\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\nTeacher：You have simplified the equation correctly. What is the value of $\\phi$?\nStudent：$\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$.\nTeacher：You correctly solved for $\\phi$, but you did not check if it lies within the required interval $-\\pi \\leqslant \\phi < \\pi$. Is $\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ within this interval?\nStudent：Yes, $\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ is between $-\\pi$ and $\\pi$.\nTeacher：Your final answer $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ is correct and lies within the interval $-\\pi \\leqslant \\phi < \\pi$.
