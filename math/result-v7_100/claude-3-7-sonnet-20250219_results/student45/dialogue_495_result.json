    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：2\nTeacher：Could you explain how you arrived at your answer of 2?\nStudent：I saw that |z₁| = |z₂| = 2, so I thought the distance |z₁ - z₂| would also be 2.\nTeacher：That's not correct reasoning. The distance between two complex numbers with equal magnitudes isn't necessarily equal to their magnitude. Could you try using the given condition z₁ + z₂ = √3 + i?\nStudent：I didn't use the condition z₁ + z₂ = √3 + i in my calculation. I just focused on the magnitudes.\nTeacher：What's the connection between |z₁-z₂| and the values of z₁+z₂ and |z₁|=|z₂|? Is there a formula you could use?\nStudent：Yes, there is a formula: |z₁-z₂|² = |z₁|² + |z₂|² - 2Re(z₁z₂*), or we can use |z₁-z₂|² = 2|z₁|² - |z₁+z₂|²/2 if |z₁|=|z₂|.\nTeacher：That's good. And do you know how to calculate |z₁+z₂|² from the given information?\nStudent：Yes, since $z_1 + z_2 = \\sqrt{3} + i$, we have $|z_1 + z_2|^2 = (\\sqrt{3})^2 + (1)^2 = 3 + 1 = 4$.\nTeacher：Good. Now you have |z₁+z₂|² = 4 and |z₁| = |z₂| = 2. Can you apply your formula for |z₁-z₂|² now?\nStudent：Yes. Using the formula:  \n$|z_1 - z_2|^2 = 2|z_1|^2 - |z_1 + z_2|^2$  \nSo, $|z_1 - z_2|^2 = 2 \\times 4 - 4 = 4$  \nTherefore, $|z_1 - z_2| = 2$.\nTeacher：The formula you wrote is incorrect. The correct formula is:\n|z₁-z₂|² = 2|z₁|² - 2Re(z₁z₂*) = 2|z₁|² - |z₁+z₂|²\nStudent：Oh, I see. I used the wrong formula in my calculation.\nTeacher：You're right to recognize your error. Can you try again with the correct formula?\nStudent：Sure. With the correct formula:  \n$|z_1 - z_2|^2 = 2|z_1|^2 - |z_1 + z_2|^2$  \nSo, $|z_1 - z_2|^2 = 2 \\times 4 - 4 = 4$  \nThus, $|z_1 - z_2| = 2$.\nTeacher：There's still an error in your calculation. |z₁|² = 4 (not |z₁| = 4) since |z₁| = 2. Can you recalculate with this correction?\nStudent：Okay, so $2|z_1|^2=2\\times 4=8$, and $|z_1+z_2|^2=4$. So $|z_1-z_2|^2=8-4=4$, so $|z_1-z_2|=2$.\nTeacher：Your calculation is correct now. You've properly applied the formula using |z₁|² = 4 and found |z₁-z₂| = 2.\nStudent：Thank you!\nTeacher：You're welcome! Is there anything else you'd like to discuss about this problem or any other math questions?\nStudent：No, that's all for now. Thank you!\nTeacher：You're welcome! Have a great day, and feel free to ask if you have any other math questions in the future.\nStudent：2\nTeacher：Can you show me the steps you took to arrive at your answer of 2?\nStudent：I looked at |z₁| = |z₂| = 2 and thought that meant |z₁ - z₂| = 2 as well.\nTeacher：That's not correct reasoning. Two points with the same distance from the origin don't necessarily have a fixed distance between them.\nStudent：zzc",
