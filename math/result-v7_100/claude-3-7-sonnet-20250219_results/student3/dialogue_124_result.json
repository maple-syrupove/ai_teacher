    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D.\nTeacher：Why did you determine that |f(x)⋅g(x)| is an odd function? Can you explain your reasoning?\nStudent：I thought that multiplying an odd and an even function and then taking the absolute value would make it odd, since oddness is preserved.\nTeacher：What property must a function h(x) have to be considered odd? Can you check if |f(x)⋅g(x)| satisfies this property?\nStudent：A function $h(x)$ is odd if $h(-x) = -h(x)$. For $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$, we have $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)|$. Since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, $f(-x) = -f(x)$ and $g(-x) = g(x)$. So $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = |-f(x)\\cdot g(x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$. This means it's actually even, not odd.\nTeacher：You've correctly identified your error. Since |f(-x)·g(-x)| = |f(x)·g(x)|, the function |f(x)·g(x)| is even, not odd as you initially thought.\nStudent：zzc",
