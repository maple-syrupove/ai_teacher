    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: $y = 2x + 0.5$.\nTeacher：Can you show me how you found the equation of the tangent line at the point (0,0)?\nStudent：I took $x=0$ and plugged it into the function, then tried to form the tangent line equation based on that value.\nTeacher：What is the formula for finding the slope of a tangent line to a curve at a specific point?\nStudent：The formula is to take the derivative of the function and evaluate it at the given point.\nTeacher：That's correct. So what is the derivative of y = 2ln(x+1), and what value do you get when you evaluate it at x = 0?\nStudent：The derivative is $y' = \\frac{2}{x+1}$. At $x = 0$, $y' = 2$.\nTeacher：So if the slope is 2 at the point (0,0), what should the equation of the tangent line be using point-slope form?\nStudent：Using point-slope form: $y - 0 = 2(x - 0)$, so $y = 2x$.\nTeacher：Your error is in your final answer. You initially wrote $y = 2x + 0.5$, but now you've correctly calculated $y = 2x$.\nStudent：zzc",
