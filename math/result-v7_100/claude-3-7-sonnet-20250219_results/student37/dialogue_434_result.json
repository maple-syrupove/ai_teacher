    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Cannot be determined.\nTeacher：Why do you believe the value of t cannot be determined from the given information?\nStudent：Because when I tried to expand $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}=0$, there was still a $t$ left, and I couldn’t figure out how to eliminate it using the information given.\nTeacher：Can you show me exactly what you got when you expanded $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 0$? What equation did you end up with?\nStudent：I got $\\vec{b} \\cdot (t\\vec{a} + (1-t)\\vec{b}) = 0$, which gives $t(\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}) + (1-t)(\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}) = 0$.\nTeacher：What are the values of $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}$ given the information in the problem?\nStudent：$\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} = \\cos 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 1$.\nTeacher：Good! Now substitute these values into your equation and solve for t.\nStudent：Okay, substituting the values, I get $t \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (1-t) \\cdot 1 = 0$.\nTeacher：Great. Can you simplify this equation and solve for t?\nStudent：$t \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 - t = 0$ \n\n$\\frac{1}{2}t + 1 - t = 0$ \n\n$\\frac{1}{2}t - t = -1$ \n\n$-\\frac{1}{2}t = -1$ \n\n$t = 2$\nTeacher：Your calculations look correct.
