    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $(1,+\\infty)$\nTeacher：What's your reasoning for selecting option C? How did you determine the monotonically increasing interval?\nStudent：I found the derivative of $f(x)$ and set $f'(x) > 0$, then solved for $x$ to get the interval.\nTeacher：Could you share specifically what you found for the derivative f'(x) and how you solved the inequality?\nStudent：I calculated $f'(x) = \\dfrac{2x-2}{x^2-2x-8}$. Then I set $\\dfrac{2x-2}{x^2-2x-8} > 0$ and solved for $x$.\nTeacher：What values of x make the function f(x) defined? And how did that affect your analysis of where f'(x) > 0?\nStudent：The function is defined when $x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0$, so $x < -2$ or $x > 4$. I didn't consider this domain when picking the interval.\nTeacher：So your mistake was not properly accounting for the domain of the function when determining where the function is increasing.\nStudent：zzc",
