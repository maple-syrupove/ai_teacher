    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$\nTeacher：What are the elements in set A and set B? Can you first determine what values of x are in each set?\nStudent：Set A contains all $x$ such that $x < 2$.  \nSet B contains all $x$ such that $3 - 2x > 0$.\nTeacher：How can we solve the inequality 3 - 2x > 0 to find exactly which values are in set B?\nStudent：We solve $3 - 2x > 0$ by first subtracting 3: $-2x > -3$. Then divide by $-2$ (and switch the inequality): $x < \\frac{3}{2}$. So set B contains all $x$ such that $x < \\frac{3}{2}$.\nTeacher：Given that set A is {x | x < 2} and set B is {x | x < 3/2}, would the intersection of these sets be empty? Think about values that satisfy both conditions.\nStudent：No, the intersection would not be empty. Any $x$ less than $\\frac{3}{2}$ satisfies both conditions.\nTeacher：Your error is in selecting option B. Since A = {x | x < 2} and B = {x | x < 3/2}, their intersection isn't empty but contains all x < 3/2.\nStudent：zzc",
