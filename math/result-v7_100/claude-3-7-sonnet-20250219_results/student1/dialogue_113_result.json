    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A. $\\{-2,-1,0,1\\}$.\nTeacher：Why did you include -2 in your answer? Can you explain your understanding of the set M?\nStudent：Set M is all real numbers greater than -3 and less than 1. So I looked for numbers in N that fit that description. -2 is between -3 and 1, so I thought it should be included.\nTeacher：What does the notation -3 < x < 1 mean precisely? Is -3 included in set M?\nStudent：No, -3 is not included in set M.\nTeacher：Correct. And what about 1? Is it included in set M?\nStudent：No, 1 is not included in set M either.\nTeacher：Good. So which elements from N are both greater than -3 and less than 1?\nStudent：From N, the elements greater than -3 and less than 1 are -2, -1, and 0.\nTeacher：Is that your final answer for M ∩ N? Did you check every element in N?\nStudent：Yes, I checked: from N, -2, -1, and 0 are all greater than -3 and less than 1, so my final answer is $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nTeacher：You've correctly identified that M ∩ N = {-2, -1, 0}. This matches option C.\nStudent：Okay, so the correct answer is C. $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nTeacher：Your error was initially selecting option A when the correct answer is option C, as you correctly concluded in your final response.\nStudent：zzc",
