    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I wrote: $\\phi$ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：Why do you think $\\phi$ cannot be solved? Can you explain your approach to this problem?\nStudent：I saw that one function was a cosine and the other was a sine, so I thought they couldn't be set equal, and I didn't know how to proceed.\nTeacher：Actually, sine and cosine functions can be related. Do you know the identity that connects sine and cosine with a phase shift?\nStudent：I remember there is an identity, but I couldn't recall it during the exam.\nTeacher：Do you remember that $\\cos(x) = \\sin(x + \\pi/2)$? This identity would be helpful for solving this problem.\nStudent：Yes, I know that identity now, but at the time I didn't think to use it to connect the two functions.\nTeacher：How would you apply that identity to connect the shifted cosine function with the sine function in this problem?\nStudent：If I use that identity, I could try to rewrite the cosine term as a sine function, but during the exam I didn’t do that step.\nTeacher：How would you write cos(2x+φ) after it's shifted right by π/2 units? What happens to the input when you shift a function?\nStudent：When shifting the graph to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, I would replace $x$ with $x-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ in the function, so it becomes $\\cos(2(x-\\frac{\\pi}{2})+\\phi)$.\nTeacher：What happens when you expand the expression inside the cosine function?\nStudent：It expands to $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：Is that the correct expansion? Can you double-check your multiplication of 2 and $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$?\nStudent：Let me check: $2(x-\\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi = 2x - \\pi + \\phi$. So, yes, the expansion is $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：Good. Now, can you use the identity we discussed to rewrite this cosine function as a sine function?\nStudent：I think I should write $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$ as $\\sin(2x - \\pi + \\phi + \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nTeacher：Is that right? Let's double-check the identity. The correct relationship is $\\cos(θ) = \\sin(θ + \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, not the other way around.\nStudent：Oh, I see. Then $\\cos(θ) = \\sin(θ + \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, so it should be $\\sin(2x-\\pi+\\phi+\\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nTeacher：That's still not quite right. The identity is cos(θ) = sin(θ + π/2), not the other way around. Double-check how you're applying it.\nStudent：I applied it as $\\cos(2x-\\pi+\\phi) = \\sin(2x-\\pi+\\phi+\\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nTeacher：Is that the correct form of the identity? The standard form is cos(θ) = sin(θ + π/2). Are you sure you're not mixing up the positions of sine and cosine?\nStudent：I think that's the identity I intended—cos(θ) can be written as sin(θ + π/2), so I added π/2 to the angle inside.\nTeacher：Your application of the identity is actually reversed. The identity is cos(θ) = sin(θ + π/2), not cos(θ) = sin(θ - π/2).\nStudent：zzc",
