    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：0\nTeacher：Can you explain how you approached finding the coefficient of x²y⁷ in the expansion of (x-y)(x+y)⁸?\nStudent：I tried to expand (x-y)(x+y)^8 by distributing, and then I listed some terms like x(x+y)^8 and -y(x+y)^8, but I couldn't find the x^2y^7 term directly.\nTeacher：What happens when you expand (x+y)^8 using the binomial theorem? How would you find the terms in x(x+y)^8 and -y(x+y)^8 that would combine to give x²y⁷?\nStudent：When I expand $(x+y)^8$, I get terms like $x^ky^{8-k}$. In $x(x+y)^8$, the $x^2y^7$ term would come from the $x^1y^7$ term of the expansion, and in $-y(x+y)^8$, the $x^2y^7$ term would come from the $x^2y^6$ term in the expansion.\nTeacher：Good. Now, what are the coefficients of x¹y⁷ and x²y⁶ in the expansion of (x+y)⁸, and how do they contribute to the coefficient of x²y⁷ in the final expression?\nStudent：The coefficient of $x^1y^7$ in $(x+y)^8$ is $\\binom{8}{7}=8$, and the coefficient of $x^2y^6$ is $\\binom{8}{6}=28$. In $x(x+y)^8$, the $x^2y^7$ term's coefficient is $8$. In $-y(x+y)^8$, the $x^2y^7$ term's coefficient is $-28$.\nTeacher：So the coefficient of x²y⁷ in the final expansion would be the sum of these contributions. What is 8 + (-28)?\nStudent：8 + (-28) is -20.\nTeacher：Correct. The coefficient of x²y⁷ in the expansion of (x-y)(x+y)⁸ is -20.\nStudent：0\nTeacher：Why did you choose 0 as your answer? Can you walk me through your reasoning step by step?\nStudent：I couldn't find an $x^2y^7$ term among the ones I wrote out, so I just wrote 0.\nTeacher：In our calculation, we found that the coefficient is -20, not 0. Your mistake was assuming the term doesn't exist because you couldn't find it in your initial expansion.\nStudent：zzc",
