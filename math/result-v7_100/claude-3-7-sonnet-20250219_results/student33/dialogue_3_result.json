    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Let $AB = x$, $AC = \\sqrt{2}x$, $AD = \\sqrt{2}$, and $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$.  \nBy the Law of Cosines:\n\\[\nBD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 - 2\\cdot AB\\cdot AD \\cos(\\angle BAD)\n\\]\nBut since I don't have the values for $AB$ or $AC$, I can't proceed to solve for $BD$.\nTeacher：What information can you derive from the angle ADB = 135°? Think about how this relates to angles in the triangle.\nStudent：Since $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$, and $D$ is on $BC$, that tells me the angle at $D$ formed by $AB$ and $DB$ is $135^\\circ$. It means there’s an obtuse angle at $D$ where $AD$ and $BD$ meet.\nTeacher：Can you clarify which angle is actually 135°? Is it the angle between AD and DB, or something else?\nStudent：It's the angle between $AD$ and $DB$ at point $D$, so $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$ refers to the angle at $D$ between $AD$ and $DB$.\nTeacher：That's not quite right. The angle ADB is not between AD and DB. It's the angle formed by points A, D, and B in that order.\nStudent：Understood. So, $\\angle ADB$ is the angle at $D$ between $AD$ and $DB$, with $A$ and $B$ as the endpoints forming that angle.\nTeacher：No, you're misunderstanding angle notation. ∠ADB means the angle formed by the three points where D is the vertex, with A and B as the points forming the angle.\nStudent：Okay, so $\\angle ADB$ is the angle at $D$ with arms $DA$ and $DB$, and its measure is $135^\\circ$.\nTeacher：Yes, that's correct. ∠ADB is the angle at D between the lines DA and DB, which equals 135°.\nStudent：Thank you for clarifying. So at point $D$, the angle between $AD$ and $DB$ is $135^\\circ$.\nTeacher：Good. Now, what approach can you use to relate the given information to find BD? Have you considered using coordinate geometry?\nStudent：I didn't try coordinate geometry; I just tried writing Law of Cosines formulas with $AB = x$, but couldn't eliminate the variables.\nTeacher：Have you considered placing the triangle in a coordinate system? Setting B at the origin might help you utilize the angle and ratio information effectively.\nStudent：I haven't tried assigning coordinates yet. I was mainly substituting variables into the cosine formula and got stuck.\nTeacher：Have you considered using the fact that BC = 3BD? This gives us a ratio relationship that could be helpful in your approach.\nStudent：I saw that $BC = 3BD$, but I didn't use it to substitute or reduce variables in my equations. I focused only on the formulas.\nTeacher：Your mistake is focusing only on formulas without using the key relationship BC = 3BD combined with the angle information to set up a solvable system.\nStudent：zzc",
