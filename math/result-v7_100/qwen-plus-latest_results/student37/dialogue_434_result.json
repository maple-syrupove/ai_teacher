    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Cannot be determined.\nTeacher：Let’s analyze this step by step. You said the value of $ t $ cannot be determined. But we are given that $ \\vec{a} $ and $ \\vec{b} $ are unit vectors with a known angle between them, and $ \\vec{c} = t\\vec{a} + (1 - t)\\vec{b} $. Also, $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 0 $.\n\nLet me ask: what is the value of $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} $?\nStudent：$\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} = \\cos 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：Good. You correctly found $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} = \\frac{1}{2} $. Now, since $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 0 $, substitute $ \\vec{c} = t\\vec{a} + (1 - t)\\vec{b} $ into the dot product.\n\nWhat do you get when you expand $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} $?\nStudent：$\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = t(\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}) + (1-t)(\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b})$\nTeacher：Correct expansion. Now substitute the known values: $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 1$ (since $\\vec{b}$ is a unit vector). What does the equation become?\nStudent：It becomes $t \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (1-t)(1) = 0$.\nTeacher：You have the equation:  \n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}t + (1 - t) = 0\n$$  \nSimplify this expression. What do you get after combining like terms?\nStudent：\\(\\frac{1}{2}t + 1 - t = 0\\)\nTeacher：Correct. Now simplify:  \n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}t - t + 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow -\\frac{1}{2}t + 1 = 0\n$$  \nThen:  \n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2}t = -1 \\Rightarrow t = 2\n$$  \n\nBut earlier you said \"Cannot be determined.\" Your mistake was not completing the algebraic simplification. You correctly set up the equation, but failed to solve it fully.  \n\n**The error: You stopped before solving for $ t $.**\nStudent：I don't think that's correct. I thought $t$ could not be eliminated from the equation, so I gave up rather than just stopping before solving for $t$.\nTeacher：You did not make a computational error, but you prematurely concluded the problem was unsolvable. The equation was solvable because all vector magnitudes and angles were given. \n\n**The error: You assumed $ t $ could not be determined before fully simplifying the equation.**\nStudent：zzc",
