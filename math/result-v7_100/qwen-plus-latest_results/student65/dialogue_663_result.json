    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose C.\nTeacher：Why do you think scenario C gives the largest spread in the data? What role do the outer values (1 and 4) play in increasing standard deviation?\nStudent：Because in scenario C, the frequencies for 1 and 4 are 0.2 each, which seems notable, and 2 and 3 are 0.3 each, so I thought having more spread out values would increase the standard deviation. The outer values, 1 and 4, being further from the mean, contribute more when their probabilities are higher.\nTeacher：You're correct that outer values increase standard deviation when they have higher probabilities. But compare the probabilities of the outer values (1 and 4) in each option—do they really have the highest probability in scenario C? Which scenario gives the greatest weight to the extremes?\nStudent：Actually, in scenario B, the probabilities for 1 and 4 are both 0.4, which is higher than scenario C where they're 0.2 each.\nTeacher：So why, then, did you choose C instead of B, given that B assigns much higher probability to the extreme values 1 and 4, which are farthest from the center? What about your reasoning led you to overlook the greater spread in B?\nStudent：I mainly calculated the standard deviation for options A and C, and since C was higher than A, I selected C.\nTeacher：You only compared A and C, but what about B? Did you calculate it? Why assume C is the largest without checking B, where the extremes have even higher probability?\nStudent：No, I didn't calculate the standard deviation for B. I should have checked all options.\nTeacher：You assumed C has the largest standard deviation without calculating B, which assigns much higher probability to the extreme values 1 and 4. Your error lies in incomplete comparison—failing to evaluate all cases, especially the one with the greatest weight on outer values.\nStudent：zzc",
