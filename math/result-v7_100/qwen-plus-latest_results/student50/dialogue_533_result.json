Only provide the information necessary to answer the teacher's current question.\n**If the teacher points out your mistake in a statement and this accusation exactly matches the reason in 【Specific Error JSON】, you must respond with the exact string \"zzc\". If the teacher states an error that does not match your actual mistake, you should deny it and wait for the teacher's next question. If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $y= \\pm x$\nTeacher：You selected $ y = \\pm x $. Recall that the asymptotes of the hyperbola $ \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 $ are $ y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a}x $. The eccentricity $ e $ is given by $ e = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{b^2}{a^2}} $, and you're told $ e = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} $. \n\nIs your choice consistent with this value of eccentricity?\nStudent：No, my choice is not consistent with the given eccentricity value.\nTeacher：You're correct that $ y = \\pm x $ implies $ \\frac{b}{a} = 1 $, which would give $ e = \\sqrt{1 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2} $, not $ \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} $.  \nSo, your mistake was assuming $ \\frac{b}{a} = 1 $.  \nThe error is: **incorrectly equating $ \\frac{b}{a} $ to 1 without using the given eccentricity to find the correct ratio**.\nStudent：zzc",
