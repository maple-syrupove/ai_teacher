    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option C, $c<a<b$.\nTeacher：You have selected option C: $ c < a < b $. Let’s examine your reasoning.\n\nRecall that $ a = \\log_2 0.2 $. Since $ 0.2 < 1 $, what can we say about the sign of $ a $? Is it positive or negative?\nStudent：Since $0.2 < 1$ and the base is greater than 1, $a$ is negative.\nTeacher：Correct, $ a = \\log_2 0.2 $ is negative because $ 0.2 < 1 $. Now consider $ b = 2^{0.2} $. Since the base is greater than 1 and the exponent is positive, what can we say about $ b $? Is $ b $ greater than or less than 1?\nStudent：$b = 2^{0.2}$ is greater than 1, because any positive power of a number greater than 1 is also greater than 1.\nTeacher：Good. Since $ b = 2^{0.2} > 1 $, and $ a < 0 $, we have $ a < 1 < b $, so $ a < b $ is correct.\n\nNow consider $ c = 0.2^{0.3} $. The base $ 0.2 < 1 $, and the exponent $ 0.3 > 0 $. What can we say about $ c $? Is $ c $ greater than or less than 1?\nStudent：If the base is less than 1 and the exponent is positive, $c = 0.2^{0.3}$ is less than 1.\nTeacher：Correct, $ c = 0.2^{0.3} < 1 $. But since $ 0.2 < 1 $ and the exponent $ 0.3 > 0 $, is $ c $ positive or negative? And how does it compare to $ a = \\log_2 0.2 $, which is negative?\nStudent：$c$ is positive, since any positive number to a positive power stays positive. As for comparing $c$ and $a$, $c$ is positive and $a$ is negative, so $a < c$.\nTeacher：You correctly stated that $ c > 0 $ and $ a < 0 $, so $ a < c $.  \nSince you chose $ c < a < b $, but now agree $ a < c $, where does your selected option go wrong?\nStudent：My selected option is wrong because I placed $c$ as less than $a$, but actually $a < c$.\nTeacher：Your error is in the order of $a$ and $c$: you claimed $c < a$, but since $a < 0$ and $c > 0$, it must be that $a < c$. Thus, option C ($c < a < b$) is incorrect.\nStudent：zzc",
