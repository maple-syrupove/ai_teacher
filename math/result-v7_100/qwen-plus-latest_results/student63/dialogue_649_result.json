    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D (α and β are perpendicular to the same plane).\nTeacher：You selected option D. Let’s examine this: if two planes are perpendicular to the same plane, does that guarantee they are parallel to each other? Consider two planes that are both perpendicular to a third plane—can they intersect each other? What orientation must they have relative to each other in 3D space?\nStudent：If two planes are both perpendicular to the same plane, they could still intersect each other, as long as they meet at an angle in space. Being perpendicular to the same plane doesn't necessarily make them parallel.\nTeacher：You're correct that two planes perpendicular to the same plane can intersect. So, does this mean option D is not a sufficient condition for the planes to be parallel? Now reconsider: what must be true about lines *within* one plane for it to be parallel to another? Think about direction vectors or lines that lie in the plane.\nStudent：If a line in plane α is parallel to plane β, then it means the line and plane β don't intersect, and their direction vectors are parallel.\nTeacher：That's true for a single line, but consider this: if only one line in α is parallel to β, could α still intersect β? What if you have *two intersecting lines* in α, both parallel to β—could α still intersect β then? Think about the directions these lines span in the plane.\nStudent：If there are two intersecting lines in α and both are parallel to β, then those two lines determine the whole plane α, and if both are parallel to β, the entire plane α would be parallel to β.\nTeacher：You're on the right track considering that two intersecting lines define the plane. But let's clarify: if two intersecting lines in α are *each parallel to the plane β*, does that necessarily mean their directions are parallel to β's direction? Could such lines still allow α to intersect β? Think about the precise geometric relationship—what must be true about the direction vectors of the lines relative to β for the planes to be parallel?\nStudent：If two intersecting lines in α are each parallel to β, then their direction vectors must both be parallel to the direction vectors that lie within β, so the planes would be parallel and could not intersect.\nTeacher：You're focusing on direction vectors being parallel to β, but consider this: if two intersecting lines in α are each parallel to the plane β, does that guarantee their direction vectors are *not* also lying in a direction that could tilt α toward intersecting β? What if both lines are parallel to the *same* line in β? Would that still ensure the planes don’t intersect? Think about the normal vectors of the planes.\nStudent：If both lines are just parallel to the same line in β, that doesn't fully restrict α—they could still form a plane that isn't parallel to β, since their plane could be tilted. To ensure α // β, their normal vectors must be parallel.\nTeacher：Exactly. If the normal vectors of α and β are parallel, then α // β. Now, going back—does option D guarantee parallel normal vectors? Or can two planes perpendicular to the same plane have different normal directions? Focus on what determines the orientation of a plane.\nStudent：Two planes perpendicular to the same plane can have different normal vectors; their normals just both need to be perpendicular to the normal of the third plane, but those normals can point in various directions within that perpendicular subspace. So, option D does not guarantee parallel normal vectors.\nTeacher：You're correct. Option D does not guarantee that the normal vectors of α and β are parallel, only that both are perpendicular to the normal of the third plane—meaning their normals lie in a plane, but can still point in different directions. Thus, D is not a sufficient condition for α ∥ β.\n\nNow, reconsider option B: if two *intersecting* lines in α are each parallel to β, then their direction vectors lie within β’s direction space. Since these vectors span α, and both are parallel to β, the plane α cannot tilt toward β—it must be parallel. This ensures the normal vectors are parallel.\n\nYour mistake was selecting D, which provides a condition that is **not sufficient** to guarantee α ∥ β.\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You selected D, but the issue is that two planes perpendicular to the same plane can still intersect — their normals don't have to be parallel. So D is not a sufficient condition. The correct condition must ensure the planes never intersect, meaning their orientation (normal vectors) must be identical. Option B guarantees this because two intersecting lines in α parallel to β force α’s direction to match β’s. That’s why D is incorrect.\nStudent：zzc",
