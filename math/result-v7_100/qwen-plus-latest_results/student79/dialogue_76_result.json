    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I set up the equation $2\\lambda + 5 \\times 4 = 0$ and solved for $\\lambda$, so $\\lambda = -10$.\nTeacher：You used the dot product and set it equal to zero, which would be correct if the vectors were perpendicular. But the problem states that $\\vec{a} \\parallel \\vec{b}$. What condition must hold for two vectors to be parallel?\nStudent：For two vectors to be parallel, one must be a scalar multiple of the other. So, their components are proportional.\nTeacher：Exactly. Since $\\vec{a} = (2,5)$ and $\\vec{b} = (\\lambda, 4)$ are parallel, the ratios of corresponding components must be equal: $\\frac{2}{\\lambda} = \\frac{5}{4}$.  \n\nYour earlier equation assumed perpendicularity, but the vectors are **parallel**, so the dot product condition does not apply.  \n\nIs your setup consistent with proportionality?\nStudent：No, my setup is not consistent with proportionality. I used the equation for perpendicularity instead.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that parallel vectors require proportional components. Your mistake was using the dot product set to zero, which applies only when vectors are perpendicular, not parallel.\nStudent：zzc",
