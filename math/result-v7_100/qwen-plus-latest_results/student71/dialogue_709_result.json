    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. -1\nTeacher：You selected B. -1. Let me ask: did you use the formula for the magnitude of a vector difference, $ |\\vec{a} - 2\\vec{b}|^2 = (\\vec{a} - 2\\vec{b}) \\cdot (\\vec{a} - 2\\vec{b}) $? What value did you get when you expanded this expression?\nStudent：I tried to substitute the options for $\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$ directly instead of expanding that formula.\nTeacher：So you tested the answer choices directly. When you plugged in $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = -1$, did you compute $|\\vec{a} - 2\\vec{b}|^2 = |\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} + 4|\\vec{b}|^2$? What value did that give for the magnitude squared?\nStudent：I substituted $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = -1$, so $|\\vec{a}|^2 = 1$, $4|\\vec{b}|^2=12$, $-4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}=4$. Thus, $1+4+12=17$.\nTeacher：You computed $ |\\vec{a} - 2\\vec{b}|^2 = 17 $ when assuming $ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = -1 $, but the given magnitude is $ |\\vec{a} - 2\\vec{b}| = 3 $, so the squared magnitude should be $ 9 $. Your error is in accepting a dot product value that leads to 17 instead of 9.\nStudent：I see, I got $|\\vec{a}-2\\vec{b}|^2=17$ when it should equal $9$. I made a calculation mistake while checking each option.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $ |\\vec{a} - 2\\vec{b}|^2 $ should be 9, but your calculation gave 17 when testing $ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = -1 $. The error lies in using an incorrect value for $ -4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} $: with $ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = -1 $, this term is $ -4(-1) = 4 $, which you did compute correctly. However, $ 1 + 4 + 12 = 17 $, not 9 — so the issue is not just arithmetic, but accepting a result that contradicts the given magnitude.\nStudent：Yes, I didn't notice the contradiction and just chose from the test results, even though 17 ≠ 9.\nTeacher：Your error is in accepting a test result that contradicts the given condition. When $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = -1$, the expression yields $|\\vec{a} - 2\\vec{b}|^2 = 17$, but it must equal $9$. You failed to recognize this inconsistency before selecting the answer.\nStudent：Yes, I didn't realize that the results didn't match the problem condition before making my selection.\nTeacher：Your error was selecting an answer that produces $|\\vec{a} - 2\\vec{b}|^2 = 17$, while the problem requires it to be $9$. You accepted a result without verifying consistency with the given magnitude.\nStudent：zzc",
