    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $\\sqrt{5}$\nTeacher：You selected option A, but let’s examine your reasoning. You were given $\\cos C = \\frac{2}{3}$, $AC = 4$, and $BC = 3$. To find $\\tan B$, we need to use the definition of tangent in a triangle, which involves the opposite and adjacent sides to angle $B$.\n\nDid you use the Law of Cosines to find side $AB$ first? This would be a necessary step since only two sides and the included angle are given. Without $AB$, we cannot determine the height or other angles directly.\n\nWhat value did you get for side $AB$?\nStudent：I didn't find the value for side $AB$. I couldn't proceed after setting up the equation.\nTeacher：You cannot find $\\tan B$ without knowing all relevant sides. Since you didn’t compute $AB$ using the Law of Cosines, you’re missing a critical step.  \n\nGiven $\\cos C = \\frac{2}{3}$, $AC = 4$, $BC = 3$, apply the Law of Cosines:  \n$$\nAB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 - 2 \\cdot AC \\cdot BC \\cdot \\cos C\n$$\nDid you substitute these values correctly? What expression did you get for $AB^2$?\nStudent：I used $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A$, but I didn't have $\\cos A$, so I couldn't find $a^2$.\nTeacher：You applied the Law of Cosines formula incorrectly by using angle A instead of angle C. The given cosine is for angle C, so the formula must be applied with sides adjacent to angle C:  \n$$\nAB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 - 2 \\cdot AC \\cdot BC \\cdot \\cos C\n$$\nYour mistake was using $\\cos A$ in the formula when $\\cos C$ is the only known cosine value. You must use the angle that is actually given—angle C.\nStudent：zzc",
