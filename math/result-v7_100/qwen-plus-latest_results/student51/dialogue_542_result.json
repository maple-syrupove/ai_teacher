    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I expanded (1 + a x) to get 1 + a x, and then expanded (1 + x)^5, but I only considered the coefficient of x^2 directly. I eventually got a = 0.\nTeacher：You considered the coefficient of $x^2$ only from $(1+x)^5$, but forgot that multiplying by $(1 + ax)$ can also contribute to the $x^2$ term. Where might that cross-term come from?\nStudent：Is it from the product of the $x$ term in $(1 + a x)$ and the $x$ term in $(1 + x)^5$?\nTeacher：Yes, that cross-term comes from multiplying $ax$ (from the first factor) with the $x$ term in $(1+x)^5$. But also consider: does the $x^2$ term in $(1+x)^5$ contribute when multiplied by the constant 1 in $(1 + ax)$? Both sources matter. Did you include both?\nStudent：I only included the $x^2$ term directly from $(1+x)^5$. I didn't combine both sources.\nTeacher：You missed the contribution from multiplying $ax$ (from $1 + ax$) with the $x$ term in $(1 + x)^5$. Both the $x^2$ term in $(1 + x)^5$ multiplied by 1 and the $x$ term in $(1 + x)^5$ multiplied by $ax$ contribute to the total coefficient of $x^2$. Your error was excluding the cross-term $a \\cdot \\binom{5}{1}x^2$.\nStudent：zzc",
