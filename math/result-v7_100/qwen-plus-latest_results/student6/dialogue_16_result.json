    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I wrote: \"There is no solution for $\\phi$.\"\nTeacher：Why do you think there is no solution for $\\phi$? Let's examine the transformation step by step. When the graph of $ y = \\cos(2x + \\phi) $ is shifted to the right by $ \\frac{\\pi}{2} $, what does the new function become?\nStudent：After shifting to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the new function is $y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：That is correct. Now simplify the expression inside the cosine. What do you get after simplifying $ \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi) $?\nStudent：After simplifying, I get $y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：Correct. So after the shift, the function is $ y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) $. Now, this graph coincides with $ y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) $. Do you recall a trigonometric identity that relates sine and cosine? Specifically, how can $ \\sin\\theta $ be expressed in terms of cosine?\nStudent：I remember that $\\sin\\theta = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta)$.\nTeacher：That is correct. Using $\\sin\\theta = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta\\right)$, apply this identity to $\\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$. What does the right-hand side become after applying the identity?\nStudent：Using the identity, $\\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - [2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}]\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$.\nTeacher：That is correct. Now simplify the expression inside the cosine: $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}$. Then write the result in the form $\\cos(-2x + \\alpha)$. Do you see how this compares to $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$? Pay attention to the sign of the angle.\nStudent：After simplification, $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$, so it becomes $\\cos(-2x + \\frac{\\pi}{6})$. This has $-2x$ instead of $2x$.\nTeacher：You're correct that it becomes $\\cos(-2x + \\frac{\\pi}{6})$. Now, recall that cosine is an even function, so $\\cos(-2x + \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\cos(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6})$.  \n\nCompare this to the shifted function: $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.  \n\nFor the graphs to coincide, the arguments must differ by a multiple of $2\\pi$, or the expressions inside the cosine must be equivalent up to periodicity.  \n\nSo, set $2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.  \n\nNow, solve for $\\phi$. What do you get after canceling $2x$?\nStudent：After canceling $2x$, I get $-\\pi + \\phi = -\\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$, so $\\phi = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：You have $\\phi = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$.  \nNow recall the constraint: $-\\pi \\leq \\phi < \\pi$.  \n\nFor $k = 0$, $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$, which is within the interval.  \nFor $k = -1$, $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} - 2\\pi = -\\frac{7\\pi}{6}$, which is less than $-\\pi$, so it's not allowed.  \n\nSo the only valid solution is $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$.  \n\nBut earlier you said there is no solution. Where did you go wrong in your initial reasoning?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You initially thought there was no solution, but now you see that $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ satisfies both the transformation and the given constraint. Your error was likely in not fully simplifying or comparing the arguments of the cosine functions, or possibly overlooking the effect of the even property of cosine. Specifically, you may have failed to recognize that $\\cos(-2x + \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\cos(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6})$, which is crucial for matching the form $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nStudent：zzc",
