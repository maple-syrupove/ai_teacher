Then, is 0 in set $ A $?\nStudent：No, $0$ is not in set $A$.\nTeacher：Since 0 is not in set $ A $, and $ A \\cap B $ only includes elements common to both $ A $ and $ B $, why did you include 0 in your original answer?\nStudent：I just applied the intersection rule and picked all elements from B that looked plausible.\nTeacher：You assumed all elements of B might be in A without checking each against the condition of A. The error is including 0 in the intersection without verifying that it satisfies $ x \\geq 1 $. Only elements that satisfy both sets belong in $ A \\cap B $.\nStudent：zzc",
