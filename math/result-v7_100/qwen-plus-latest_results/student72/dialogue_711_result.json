    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：|AB| = 2.\nTeacher：You said |AB| = 2. Let me ask: what are the coordinates of point A on the parabola $ y^2 = 4x $, and how did you use the condition $ |AF| = |BF| $?\nStudent：I let A be (x, y) on the parabola, so y^2 = 4x. F is (1, 0), B is (3, 0). I set |AF| = |BF|, and then I tried y = 0, so A was (1, 0).\nTeacher：You assumed $ y = 0 $ to find point A, leading to $ A = (1, 0) $. However, this choice does not satisfy the condition $ |AF| = |BF| $ unless $ |AF| = 0 $, but $ |BF| = 2 $. The error is assuming $ A = (1, 0) $ without verifying $ |AF| = |BF| $.\nStudent：That’s not exactly my error. I tried a specific value for y to simplify the calculations.\nTeacher：You assumed $ y = 0 $ to find point A, but this leads to $ |AF| = 0 $ while $ |BF| = 2 $, violating $ |AF| = |BF| $. The error is using a specific value for $ y $ without ensuring it satisfies the distance condition. You must solve $ |AF| = |BF| $ generally, not by arbitrary simplification.\nStudent：zzc",
