    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I set $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ as unknowns and wrote the system: $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1$, $a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 2$. Then I couldn't solve for $a_6 + a_7 + a_8$.\nTeacher：You're missing the fact that it's a geometric sequence — each term relates to the previous one by a common ratio $ r $. Did you use the property $ a_n = a_1 r^{n-1} $? How did you express $ a_2, a_3, a_4 $ in terms of $ a_1 $ and $ r $?\nStudent：I wrote $a_2 = a_1 r$, $a_3 = a_1 r^2$, $a_4 = a_1 r^3$.\nTeacher：You correctly expressed the terms using $ a_1 $ and $ r $. Now, substitute these into the two given equations:  \n$ a_1 + a_1 r + a_1 r^2 = 1 $ and $ a_1 r + a_1 r^2 + a_1 r^3 = 2 $.  \n\nNotice that the second sum is $ r $ times the first sum. Does that hold in your calculations? Check if you used this relationship.\nStudent：I didn't notice that relationship. I just set up the equations with the unknowns and didn't relate the two sums using the ratio.\nTeacher：You missed that the second sum is the first sum multiplied by $ r $. Since $ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1 $, then $ r(a_1 + a_2 + a_3) = a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 2 $, so $ r \\cdot 1 = 2 $, meaning $ r = 2 $. Your error was not recognizing this key multiplicative relationship between the two sums due to the geometric sequence property.\nStudent：zzc",
