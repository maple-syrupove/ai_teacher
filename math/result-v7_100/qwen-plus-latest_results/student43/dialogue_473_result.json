    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: $y = 2x + 0.5$.\nTeacher：Let’s examine your answer. You wrote the tangent line as $ y = 2x + 0.5 $. Let’s focus on the point $(0,0)$. Does your line pass through this point? What should the value of $ y $ be when $ x = 0 $?\nStudent：When $x = 0$, $y = 2 \\times 0 + 0.5 = 0.5$. So the value of $y$ would be $0.5$.\nTeacher：Exactly — when $ x = 0 $, your line gives $ y = 0.5 $, but the point $ (0,0) $ is on the curve. For the tangent line to pass through this point, it must satisfy $ y = 0 $ when $ x = 0 $. Your line does not pass through $ (0,0) $. The error is in the constant term — the y-intercept should be 0, not 0.5.\nStudent：zzc",
