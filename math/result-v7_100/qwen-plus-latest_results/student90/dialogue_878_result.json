    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: \n\n$$z - \\bar{z} = \\left(\\frac{1-\\mathrm{i}}{2+2\\mathrm{i}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1+\\mathrm{i}}{2-2\\mathrm{i}}\\right)$$\nTeacher：You substituted $\\bar{z}$ as $\\frac{1+\\mathrm{i}}{2-2\\mathrm{i}}$, but did you simplify $z$ first? Consider what happens to the imaginary part when you rationalize $z$. Is $z$ correctly represented before taking its conjugate?\nStudent：No, I didn't simplify $z$ first. I just used it as $\\frac{1-\\mathrm{i}}{2+2\\mathrm{i}}$.\nTeacher：You must simplify $z$ first by rationalizing the denominator. Only then can you correctly find $\\bar{z}$. Your current expression for $\\bar{z}$ assumes the unsimplified form is valid for conjugation, which leads to an error. What is $z$ after simplification?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：To simplify $ z = \\frac{1 - i}{2 + 2i} $, first factor the denominator: $ 2 + 2i = 2(1 + i) $. Then multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of $ 1 + i $, which is $ 1 - i $. What do you get after doing that?\nStudent：$$(1-\\mathrm{i}) \\cdot (1-\\mathrm{i}) = 1 - 2\\mathrm{i} + (\\mathrm{i})^2 = 1 - 2\\mathrm{i} - 1 = -2\\mathrm{i}$$\n\nThe denominator: $[2(1+\\mathrm{i})] \\cdot (1-\\mathrm{i}) = 2[(1+\\mathrm{i})(1-\\mathrm{i})] = 2[1 - (\\mathrm{i})^2] = 2[1 - (-1)] = 2 \\times 2 = 4$\n\nSo: $\\frac{1-\\mathrm{i}}{2+2\\mathrm{i}} = \\frac{-2\\mathrm{i}}{4} = \\frac{-\\mathrm{i}}{2}$\nTeacher：You correctly simplified $ z = \\frac{-i}{2} $. Now, what is the conjugate of $ z $? Recall that the conjugate of $ -\\frac{i}{2} $ is $ \\frac{i}{2} $. Did you apply conjugation correctly?\nStudent：No, I didn't apply conjugation correctly before; I just swapped the sign in the numerator of the original fraction rather than conjugating after simplification.\nTeacher：You mistakenly took the conjugate before simplifying $ z $. The conjugate must be applied to the simplified form $ z = -\\frac{i}{2} $, not the original expression. This led to an incorrect $ \\bar{z} $.\nStudent：zzc",
