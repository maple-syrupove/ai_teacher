    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried $x=2, y=0$, so $z=2-0=2$. I thought the minimum value was 2.\nTeacher：You substituted a single point without verifying if it yields the minimum. The minimum of a linear function under linear constraints occurs at a vertex of the feasible region. Did you find all the intersection points of the boundary lines and evaluate $ z = x - 5y $ at each?\nStudent：No, I didn't find all the intersection points of the boundary lines. I just tried a point that was on one of the boundaries.\nTeacher：You must find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the boundary lines. The minimum value of $ z = x - 5y $ occurs at one of these vertices. Have you determined all the intersection points of the three constraints?\nStudent：No, I haven't determined all the intersection points of the three constraints yet.\nTeacher：You must find the intersection points of each pair of boundary lines:  \n1. $ 4x - 3y - 3 = 0 $  \n2. $ x - 2y - 2 = 0 $  \n3. $ 2x + 6y - 9 = 0 $  \n\nSolve these three systems pairwise. Are all three intersection points within the feasible region defined by the inequalities?\nStudent：I haven't checked if all three intersection points are within the feasible region yet.\nTeacher：You must first find the three intersection points by solving the pairs of equations. Then, verify which of these points satisfy all the original inequalities. Only the points within the feasible region can be considered. Have you solved for the intersection points yet?\nStudent：No, I haven't solved for the intersection points yet.\nTeacher：You must solve the three pairs of equations to find the vertices of the feasible region. Without these points, you cannot determine where the minimum of $ z = x - 5y $ occurs. What prevents you from solving the systems now?\nStudent：I just didn't realize I needed to find all the intersection points; I thought trying random boundary points was enough.\nTeacher：You assumed that testing a single boundary point is sufficient to find the minimum, but for linear programming problems, the minimum must occur at a vertex of the feasible region. Your error is in not systematically finding the intersection points of the constraints and evaluating $ z $ at those vertices.\nStudent：zzc",
