    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I got the maximum value to be $2.484$.\nTeacher：You mentioned the maximum value is approximately 2.484. Let me ask: what value of $ x $ did you use to get this result?\nStudent：I used $x = \\arcsin(1)$, so $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：You substituted $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $, but let's check: what is $ \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $? Then reevaluate $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $.\nStudent：$\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 0$. So, $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\sqrt{3} \\cdot 0 - \\frac{3}{4} = 1 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} $, but your initial maximum value was 2.484. Since this is much larger than $ \\frac{1}{4} $, you must have evaluated $ f(x) $ at another point. What other $ x $-value did you consider, and how did you find it?\nStudent：I tried to find the maximum by rewriting the function as $(\\sin x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 - 1$, then picked $\\sin x = 1$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly completed the square. The expression $(\\sin x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 - 1$ expands to $\\sin^2 x + \\sqrt{3} \\sin x + \\frac{3}{4} - 1$, which is not equivalent to the original function. Your error lies in mismatching $\\cos x$ with $\\sin x$ during the completion of the square.\nStudent：zzc",
