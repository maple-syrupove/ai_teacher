    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：\\[\n\\tan\\alpha = \\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\n\\]\nTeacher：You cannot treat the tangent function as if it were a variable that can be \"moved\" across the equation like algebraic terms. The expression $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}$ does **not** imply that $\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4} = \\frac{1}{5}$. \n\nWhy do you think $\\tan\\alpha = \\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)$ follows from the given equation?\nStudent：Because I thought adding $\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ to both sides would isolate $\\alpha$ and keep the equation balanced, like in algebra.\nTeacher：You're treating the tangent function as if it were a number, but it's a function. From $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}$, you cannot conclude $\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4} = \\frac{1}{5}$. \n\nWhat is the correct relationship between an angle and its tangent? Why can't you simply \"add $\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$\" to the value $\\frac{1}{5}$ like this?\nStudent：Because the tangent function is periodic and not one-to-one, so different angles can have the same tangent value. You can't \"add\" angles to a number like that.\nTeacher：Exactly. Since $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{1}{5}$ does **not** imply $\\theta = \\frac{1}{5}$, you cannot recover $\\alpha$ by simply adding $\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ to $\\frac{1}{5}$. \n\nYour error lies in misunderstanding the inverse process: you treated $\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)$ as if it were $\\frac{1}{5}$, which is incorrect. The value $\\frac{1}{5}$ is the **output** of the tangent function, not the **input**.\nStudent：I understand. I thought I could invert the tangent function directly and add the angle, but that doesn’t work.\nTeacher：You assumed that $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}$ implies $\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4} = \\frac{1}{5}$, but this is incorrect because $\\frac{1}{5}$ is the value of the tangent, not the angle itself. The correct step requires using the inverse tangent function: $\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4} = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)$, not $\\frac{1}{5}$. Your mistake was conflating the output of the tangent function with the angle measure.\nStudent：zzc",
