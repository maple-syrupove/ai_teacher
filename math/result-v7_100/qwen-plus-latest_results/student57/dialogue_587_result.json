    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option B, that is, $\\frac{9\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：You assumed the sphere fits in a way related to the height of the prism and the right triangle base. Let me ask: did you consider the limiting factor to be the smallest distance from the center of the sphere to the faces of the prism? Specifically, did you use the inradius of the right triangle base as a constraint?\nStudent：No, I didn't use the inradius of the triangular base as a constraint.\nTeacher：Then your error lies in neglecting the spatial geometry constraint: the sphere must fit within the prism in 3D, so its radius is limited by the smallest distance from the center to all faces. The maximum sphere radius cannot exceed the inradius of the right triangle base, which is $ \\frac{AB + BC - AC}{2} = \\frac{6 + 8 - 10}{2} = 2 $. Hence, your chosen answer $ \\frac{9\\pi}{2} $ corresponds to a radius larger than 2, which is not possible.\nStudent：zzc",
