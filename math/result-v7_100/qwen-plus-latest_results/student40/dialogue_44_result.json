    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I got the radius as 1.5, so the surface area is 9π.\nTeacher：You assumed the radius is 1.5, but that would only be true if the sphere’s diameter matched the cuboid’s longest edge. However, the sphere circumscribes the entire cuboid, meaning the diameter must stretch from one vertex to the opposite vertex through space. Where might your calculation of the radius have gone wrong?\nStudent：I calculated the radius as half of the length, so I took 3 divided by 2 and got 1.5.\nTeacher：You took half the length of the cuboid (3) to find the radius, but the sphere's diameter must span the cuboid's space diagonal—not just its length. The error is in using only one dimension instead of computing the full diagonal from corner to opposite corner in 3D space.\nStudent：zzc",
