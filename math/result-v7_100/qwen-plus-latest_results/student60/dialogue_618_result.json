    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. 5\nTeacher：You selected A. 5. Let me ask: did you compute the coordinates of points M and N by solving the line equation with the parabola, or did you use a different method?\nStudent：I used the distances from F to M and F to N directly, without solving for the coordinates.\nTeacher：That approach may lead to an error. The dot product $\\overrightarrow{FM} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{FN}$ requires vector components, not just distances. Did you account for the direction of the vectors, or did you only use magnitudes?\nStudent：I only used the magnitudes of the distances from F to M and F to N.\nTeacher：Using only the magnitudes of distances ignores the vector nature of the dot product. The dot product $\\overrightarrow{FM} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{FN}$ depends on both the magnitudes and the angle between the vectors, or equivalently, on the components of the vectors. By using only distances, you omitted directional information, which is essential. This is the source of your error.\nStudent：zzc",
