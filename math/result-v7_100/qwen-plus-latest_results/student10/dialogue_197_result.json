    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：You wrote $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$. Let’s think: is point $E$ the same as point $A$? If not, how can $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ equal $\\overrightarrow{AB}$?  \n\nCould you explain how you used the fact that $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$, and $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$?\nStudent：I actually didn't use the fact that $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$ or that $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$ in my answer.\nTeacher：You didn’t use the given midpoints. Since $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, how would you express $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$?\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{AD} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})$\nTeacher：Good. Since $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $\\overrightarrow{AD} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})$. Now, $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$, so how would you express $\\overrightarrow{AE}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AD}$, and then in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$?\nStudent：Since $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$, $\\overrightarrow{AE} = \\frac{1}{2} \\overrightarrow{AD} = \\frac{1}{4}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})$.\nTeacher：Correct, $\\overrightarrow{AE} = \\frac{1}{4}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})$. Now, to find $\\overrightarrow{EB}$, recall that $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\overrightarrow{AE}$. Did you apply this vector subtraction correctly?\nStudent：No, I didn't use that vector subtraction. I directly assumed $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$ without subtracting $\\overrightarrow{AE}$.\nTeacher：You assumed $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$ without accounting for the position of $E$. The correct approach requires $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\overrightarrow{AE}$, and since $\\overrightarrow{AE} = \\frac{1}{4}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})$, your omission of this subtraction led to the error.\nStudent：zzc",
