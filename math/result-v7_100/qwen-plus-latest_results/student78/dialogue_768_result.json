    "question": "24. Given the function $f(x)=|2 x-a|+a$.\n\n(1) When $a=2$, find the solution set for the inequality $f(x) \\leqslant 6$.\n\n(2) Let the function be $g(x)=|2 x-1|$. If for all $x \\in R$, the inequality $f(x)+g(x) \\geqslant 3$ holds, find the range of values for $a$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution: (1) When $a=2$, the function is $f(x)=|2 x-2|+2$.\nThe inequality is $f(x) \\leqslant 6$, so:\n$|2 x-2|+2 \\leqslant 6$\n$|2 x-2| \\leqslant 4$\nDivide by 2 inside the absolute value:\n$2|x-1| \\leqslant 4$\n$|x-1| \\leqslant 2$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$-2 \\leqslant x-1 \\leqslant 2$\nAdding 1 to all parts of the inequality:\n$-1 \\leqslant x \\leqslant 3$\nTherefore, the solution set for the inequality is $\\{x \\mid-1 \\leqslant x \\leqslant 3\\}$.\n\n(2) We are given the inequality $f(x)+g(x) \\geqslant 3$ for all $x \\in R$.\nSubstitute the expressions for $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:\n$(|2 x-a|+a) + |2 x-1| \\geqslant 3$\n$|2 x-a| + |2 x-1| \\geqslant 3-a$\n\nThis inequality must hold for all real numbers $x$. We can analyze this using the triangle inequality. The expression on the left, $|2x-1| + |2x-a|$, represents the sum of the distances from a point $2x$ to the points $1$ and $a$ on the number line. The minimum value of this sum occurs when $2x$ is between $1$ and $a$. The minimum value is $|a-1|$.\nSo, for the inequality to hold for all $x$, the minimum value of the left-hand side must be greater than or equal to the right-hand side.\nMinimum value of $(|2 x-a| + |2 x-1|) = |a-1|$.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$|a-1| \\geqslant 3-a$\n\nWe consider two cases based on the expression inside the absolute value:\n\nCase 1: $a-1 \\geqslant 0$, which means $a \\geqslant 1$.\nThe inequality becomes $a-1 \\geqslant 3-a$.\n$2a \\geqslant 4$\n$a \\geqslant 2$.\nCombining with the case condition ($a \\geqslant 1$), the solution for this case is $a \\geqslant 2$.\n\nCase 2: $a-1 < 0$, which means $a < 1$.\nThe inequality becomes $-(a-1) \\geqslant 3-a$.\n$-a+1 \\geqslant 3-a$\n$1 \\geqslant 3$.\nThis is a contradiction, so there are no solutions in this case.\n\nCombining the results from both cases, the range of values for $a$ is $[2, +\\infty)$.\n\nAlternative analysis for the inequality $|a-1| \\geqslant 3-a$:\nIf the right side $3-a$ is negative (i.e., $a>3$), the inequality holds because the left side is always non-negative. So $a>3$ is part of the solution.\nIf the right side $3-a$ is non-negative (i.e., $a \\le 3$), we can square both sides:\n$(a-1)^2 \\geqslant (3-a)^2$\n$a^2 - 2a + 1 \\geqslant 9 - 6a + a^2$\n$4a \\geqslant 8$\n$a \\geqslant 2$.\nCombining this with the condition for this part ($a \\le 3$), we get $2 \\le a \\le 3$.\nCombining the two parts of the solution ($a>3$ and $2 \\le a \\le 3$), the total range of values for $a$ is $[2, +\\infty)$.",
