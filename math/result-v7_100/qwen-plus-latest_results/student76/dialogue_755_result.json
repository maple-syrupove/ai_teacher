    "question": "20. (12 points) In the Cartesian coordinate system $xOy$, the curve $C: y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}$ intersects the line $l: y=k x+a(a>0)$ at two points M and N.\n\n(I) When $k=0$, find the equations of the tangent lines to C at points M and N respectively.\n\n(II) Does there exist a point P on the y-axis such that for any value of k, we always have $\\angle O P M=\\angle O P N$? (Explain your reasoning)\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution: (I) When $k=0$, the line equation becomes $l: y=a$.\nTo find the intersection points M and N, we solve the system:\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y=a \\\\ y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\end{array}\\right.$\nThis gives $\\frac{x^2}{4} = a$, so $x^2 = 4a$, which means $x = \\pm 2\\sqrt{a}$.\nWithout loss of generality, let $M$ be the point with the positive x-coordinate. So, the coordinates are $M(2 \\sqrt{a}, a)$ and $N(-2 \\sqrt{a}, a)$.\n\nThe derivative of the curve $C: y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}$ is $y' = \\frac{2x}{4} = \\frac{x}{2}$.\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at M is $y'|_{x=2\\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{a}}{2} = \\sqrt{a}$.\nThe equation of the tangent line at M is $y - a = \\sqrt{a}(x - 2\\sqrt{a})$.\n$y - a = \\sqrt{a}x - 2a$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{a}x - y - a = 0$.\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at N is $y'|_{x=-2\\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{-2\\sqrt{a}}{2} = -\\sqrt{a}$.\nThe equation of the tangent line at N is $y - a = -\\sqrt{a}(x - (-2\\sqrt{a}))$.\n$y - a = -\\sqrt{a}x - 2a$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{a}x + y + 3a = 0$. (Note: there is a calculation error in the original Chinese answer for the tangent at N. It should be $y-a = -\\sqrt{a}(x+2\\sqrt{a}) \\implies y-a = -\\sqrt{a}x - 2a \\implies \\sqrt{a}x + y + a = 0$). Let's use the correct one: $\\sqrt{a}x + y + a = 0$.\n\n(II) Yes, such a point exists. The point is $P(0, -a)$.\nLet $P$ be a point $(0, b)$ on the y-axis. Let the intersection points be $M(x_1, y_1)$ and $N(x_2, y_2)$. The condition $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ (where O is the origin) means that the line segment OP (which is on the y-axis) is the angle bisector of $\\angle MPN$. This implies that the angles that PM and PN make with the y-axis are equal. This is equivalent to saying that the slopes of PM and PN are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign (i.e., $k_{PM} = -k_{PN}$, or $k_{PM} + k_{PN} = 0$), assuming M and N are on opposite sides of the y-axis (which they are, as we will see).\n\nLet's find the intersection points by solving the system:\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y=kx+a \\\\ y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\end{array}\\right.$\n$\frac{x^2}{4} = kx+a \\implies x^2 - 4kx - 4a = 0$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum and product of the roots are: $x_1 + x_2 = 4k$ and $x_1x_2 = -4a$.\nSince $a>0$, $x_1x_2$ is negative, meaning one root is positive and one is negative, so M and N are on opposite sides of the y-axis.\n\nThe slopes of PM and PN are $k_{PM} = \\frac{y_1-b}{x_1}$ and $k_{PN} = \\frac{y_2-b}{x_2}$.\nWe require $k_{PM} + k_{PN} = 0$.\n$\\frac{y_1-b}{x_1} + \\frac{y_2-b}{x_2} = 0$\n$\\frac{x_2(y_1-b) + x_1(y_2-b)}{x_1x_2} = 0$\n$x_2y_1 - bx_2 + x_1y_2 - bx_1 = 0$\nSubstitute $y_1 = kx_1+a$ and $y_2 = kx_2+a$:\n$x_2(kx_1+a) - bx_2 + x_1(kx_2+a) - bx_1 = 0$\n$kx_1x_2 + ax_2 - bx_2 + kx_1x_2 + ax_1 - bx_1 = 0$\n$2k(x_1x_2) + (a-b)(x_1+x_2) = 0$\nNow substitute the values from Vieta's formulas:\n$2k(-4a) + (a-b)(4k) = 0$\n$-8ak + 4k(a-b) = 0$\nSince this must hold for any value of $k$, we can divide by $4k$ (assuming $k \neq 0$. If $k=0$, the condition holds trivially as the setup is symmetric).\n$-2a + (a-b) = 0$\n$-a - b = 0$\n$b = -a$\n\nThus, the point P must be $(0, -a)$. This point is independent of $k$. Therefore, such a point exists, and its coordinates are $(0, -a)$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：(II) I tried to set the coordinates of P as (0, b), then attempted to write the equations of OP, PM, and PN, and used the angle bisector formula. However, I couldn't get a concrete value for b and got stuck simplifying the expressions for the angles.\nTeacher：You assumed the angle bisector condition can be applied directly using coordinate formulas for angles. The issue is that you're treating the angle bisector in a symmetric geometric way without considering whether the vectors or slopes satisfy the reflection property. \n\nAsk yourself: What must be true about the slopes of PM and PN if ∠OPM = ∠OPN? Is it sufficient to equate angle formulas algebraically without examining symmetry? \n\nWhere exactly did you place P, and what symmetry should exist in the slopes of PM and PN for the angle condition to hold for all k?\nStudent：I let P be at (0, b) on the y-axis. I didn't analyze the symmetry in the slopes of PM and PN with respect to k; I just set up equations for the angles.\nTeacher：You assumed the angle condition implies equal algebraic expressions for angles without considering that for ∠OPM = ∠OPN to hold for all *k*, the reflection symmetry across line OP must exist.  \n\nAsk yourself: If P is fixed on the y-axis, what must be true about the slopes of PM and PN so that OP bisects ∠MPN *for all k*? Does this require the midpoint of M and N to lie on OP, or some other invariant?  \n\nWhere is the symmetry of points M and N with respect to the y-axis when *k* varies? Does your current setup preserve this symmetry for arbitrary *k*?\nStudent：My current setup does not preserve symmetry for arbitrary k. I just expressed the points M and N as intersections, but didn't look for any symmetric relation between M, N, and the y-axis.\nTeacher：You overlooked that for ∠OPM = ∠OPN to hold for all *k*, the point P must ensure that PM and PN are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Since M and N are roots of a quadratic resulting from $ y = \\frac{x^2}{4} $ and $ y = kx + a $, their midpoint lies at $ x = 2k $, which is not on the y-axis unless *k=0*. Thus, unless the construction forces symmetry across the y-axis, the angles cannot be equal for all *k*.  \n\nAsk yourself: If M and N are not symmetric about the y-axis for arbitrary *k*, can P still lie on the y-axis and satisfy the angle condition? What geometric property must P have if it must work for *all* *k*?\nStudent：If M and N aren't symmetric about the y-axis for all k, then P can't always be located on the y-axis and still maintain equal angles OPM and OPN for every k. For all k, P would have to be positioned so that the angle bisector property is preserved regardless of how M and N move, which may not be possible if their symmetry shifts as k changes.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assume that because M and N are not symmetric about the y-axis for all k, no such P on the y-axis can exist. The key error lies in assuming that symmetry of M and N about the y-axis is necessary for ∠OPM = ∠OPN when, in fact, the condition may still hold if P is chosen such that OP is the angle bisector via a different geometric invariant — not necessarily reflection symmetry of M and N. \n\nAsk yourself: Can the angle bisector condition hold without M and N being symmetric about the y-axis, provided P is chosen at a specific fixed point (e.g., related to the focus of the parabola)? What invariant property of parabolas might ensure equal angles for all k?\nStudent：If P is selected at a specific point related to the parabola, such as the focus at (0,1), then OP may act as the angle bisector for all k due to the reflective property of a parabola.\nTeacher：You are on the right track by considering the focus. However, your error lies in assuming the reflective property of the parabola applies to chords MN formed by arbitrary lines $ y = kx + a $, when in fact that property specifically relates to rays from the focus reflecting off the parabola parallel to the axis. The condition here involves angles at P with respect to O, M, and N — not incidence and reflection of light rays. \n\nAsk yourself: Does the reflective property of the parabola imply that $ \\angle OPM = \\angle OPN $ for any chord MN intersected by a line $ y = kx + a $? Or does it only apply to tangent or focal chord behavior?\nStudent：The reflective property only directly applies to light rays from the focus reflecting off the parabola according to specific directions (usually parallel to the axis) or for focal chords, not for any arbitrary chord MN formed by $y=kx+a$. So, in this case, it does not guarantee $ \\angle OPM = \\angle OPN $ for all k.\nTeacher：You correctly recognize that the reflective property does not apply to arbitrary chords $ MN $. However, your error lies in assuming that because the reflection principle fails here, no such point $ P $ can exist. The key oversight is failing to consider that the condition $ \\angle OPM = \\angle OPN $ for all $ k $ may still hold if $ P $ is chosen such that the angles are equal not due to reflection, but due to a hidden symmetry in the configuration involving the **director circle** or **orthoptic property** of the parabola — specifically, whether $ P $ lies at the intersection of tangents or satisfies an isogonal conjugate condition. \n\nAsk yourself: Could $ P $ be the intersection point of the tangents at $ M $ and $ N $, and if so, under what fixed location (e.g., $ (0,a) $) would this yield equal angles for all $ k $?\nStudent：If P is the intersection point of the tangents at M and N, then its y-coordinate should be (0, –a), since for $k=0$, both tangents at M and N intersect the y-axis at (0, –a).\nTeacher：Your error lies in assuming the intersection point of the tangents at M and N lies at $(0, -a)$ for all $k$, when in fact this point depends on $k$. For $k=0$, symmetry gives the y-intercept as $(0, -a)$, but for arbitrary $k$, the intersection of tangents at M and N does not remain fixed at $(0, -a)$. Thus, your assumption that this point is independent of $k$ is incorrect.\nStudent：Yes, for $k=0$, the tangents at M and N intersect at (0, –a); but for arbitrary $k$, the intersection depends on $k$, so P does not remain fixed at (0, –a).\nTeacher：You correctly recognize that the intersection of the tangents at M and N moves with $k$, so $(0, -a)$ is not a fixed point. However, your error lies in focusing only on the tangent intersection without considering that for $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ to hold for all $k$, the point $P$ must satisfy a *constant* angular bisector condition — which requires the distances from $P$ to the lines $PM$ and $PN$ to be symmetric in a way that only occurs if $P$ is at a special fixed point independent of $k$. \n\nAsk yourself: If the midpoint of chord $MN$ lies at $x = 2k$, and the perpendicular bisector of $MN$ passes through a fixed point on the y-axis, could that point be independent of $k$ only if it relates to the **directrix** or **vertex symmetry**? What fixed geometric feature of the parabola could allow such an invariant angle condition?\nStudent：If the perpendicular bisector of MN always passes through a fixed point on the y-axis for all k, that point would have to be the vertex at (0, 0), since the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis and the vertex is the only invariant point. But as k varies, the perpendicular bisector does not always pass through (0, 0). There isn't another fixed feature on the y-axis, like the directrix (which for this parabola is y = –1), that would provide invariant symmetry for all possible chords MN as k changes.\nTeacher：Your error lies in assuming that the perpendicular bisector of chord $ MN $ must pass through a fixed point on the y-axis for $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ to hold, when in fact the angle condition depends on *directional symmetry* of the lines $ PM $ and $ PN $ with respect to line $ OP $, not on the perpendicular bisector passing through a fixed point. The key oversight is failing to consider that the required symmetry may be encoded in the **isogonal conjugate** property — specifically, that $ P $ must be chosen so that the reflections of lines $ PM $ and $ PN $ over line $ OP $ are symmetric in slope for all $ k $.\nStudent：I only tried to set up the equations for PM and PN, and directly wrote angle formulas involving (0, b), M, and N, but couldn't proceed to a solution for b.\nTeacher：Your error lies in attempting to enforce $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ by direct algebraic comparison of angle formulas without recognizing that for this condition to hold for *all* $k$, the point $P = (0, b)$ must make $OP$ the *isogonal conjugate line* with respect to the family of chords $MN$. The key oversight is failing to realize that the slopes of $PM$ and $PN$ must satisfy a symmetric rational function in $k$ only if $b = a$, which is the unique value ensuring the isogonal condition via the parabola’s geometric properties. You assumed $b$ must be derived from symmetry of points, not from invariance of angular relationships.\nStudent：I set P at (0, b), wrote out equations for PM and PN, and tried to compute the angles using formulas, but couldn't solve for b algebraically.\nTeacher：You assumed that computing angles directly via algebraic formulas would yield a solvable equation for $ b $, but your core error lies in not recognizing that for $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ to hold for all $k$, the slopes of $PM$ and $PN$ must satisfy a symmetric relationship under inversion in $k$—and this symmetry only occurs if $b = a$. You overlooked that the condition forces $P$ to lie at $(0, a)$, the y-intercept of line $l$, which is the unique point ensuring isogonal symmetry for all chords $MN$.\nStudent：I let P be at (0, b), but I couldn't derive an explicit solution for b with the angle equations, so I got stuck.\nTeacher：Your error lies in attempting to derive $ b $ through direct angle formulas without recognizing that for the angles $ \\angle OPM $ and $ \\angle OPN $ to be equal for *all* $ k $, the point $ P = (0, b) $ must create a symmetric rational expression in $ k $ for the slopes of $ PM $ and $ PN $. This symmetry only occurs when $ b = a $, as $ (0, a) $ is the unique point on the y-axis that ensures the isogonal condition across all chords $ MN $. You failed to identify this invariant by relying solely on unsimplified algebraic expressions.\nStudent：zzc",
