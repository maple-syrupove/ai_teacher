    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. 120 ways\nTeacher：You're suggesting 120 ways. Let me ask: did you consider that the volunteers are being assigned to 4 distinct events, each needing at least one volunteer, and that the events must all have at least one person? How did you account for the distribution of 5 volunteers across 4 events with no event left empty?\nStudent：I thought I could just assign each volunteer to an event one by one, so I did a direct permutation, without thinking further about events being left empty.\nTeacher：You assumed a direct permutation of assigning 5 volunteers to 4 events, but this doesn't ensure each event gets at least one volunteer. The error is that you didn't account for the constraint that all 4 events must have at least one volunteer, which requires partitioning the 5 volunteers into 4 non-empty groups. Your approach overcounts invalid distributions where one event might be left out.\nStudent：zzc",
