    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to differentiate $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ directly to find its extrema, but the derivative became complicated. I couldn’t simplify it to get $M$ and $m$, so I wasn’t able to give a specific value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：You're correct that directly differentiating leads to a complex expression. However, the key issue in your approach is assuming that differentiation is the only or best way to find $ M + m $. The mistake lies in not considering symmetry or algebraic simplification of the function before differentiating.  \n\nLet’s analyze: does $ f(x) + f(-x) $ simplify in a meaningful way? Have you tried evaluating $ f(x) + f(-x) $?\nStudent：No, I didn't try evaluating $f(x) + f(-x)$. I went straight to differentiating the original $f(x)$.\nTeacher：You missed exploiting the symmetry of the function. The error is not trying to simplify $ f(x) + f(-x) $, which would reveal a constant sum. This symmetry is key to finding $ M + m $ without calculus. Try computing $ f(x) + f(-x) $ now.\nStudent：Okay. Let me compute $f(x) + f(-x)$:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}\n\\]\n\\[\nf(-x) = \\frac{((-x)+1)^2 + \\sin(-x)}{(-x)^2 + 1}\n       = \\frac{(1-x)^2 - \\sin x}{x^2 + 1}\n\\]\nSo,\n\n\\[\nf(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x + (1-x)^2 - \\sin x}{x^2+1}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{(x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2}{x^2+1}\n\\]\nTeacher：You correctly computed $ f(x) + f(-x) $, and the sines canceled. Now simplify the numerator:  \n$$\n(x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 + 1 - 2x + x^2 = 2x^2 + 2\n$$\nSo,\n$$\nf(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{2x^2 + 2}{x^2 + 1} = 2\n$$\nThus, $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $ for all $ x $.  \n\nNow, since this sum is constant, what does that imply about the maximum $ M $ and minimum $ m $? Specifically, if $ f(x) $ achieves its maximum at some point, what can you say about $ f(-x) $ at that point?\nStudent：If $f(x)$ achieves its maximum $M$ at some $x_0$, then $f(-x_0)$ must be $2 - M$, since $f(x_0) + f(-x_0) = 2$.\nTeacher：Exactly. Now, since $ m $ is the minimum value of $ f $, and $ f(-x_0) = 2 - M $, then $ 2 - M \\geq m $. But similarly, if $ f(x_1) = m $, then $ f(-x_1) = 2 - m \\leq M $.  \n\nGiven that $ M $ and $ m $ are the maximum and minimum values, and the function satisfies $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $, what must $ M + m $ be?\nStudent：$M + m = 2$.\nTeacher：Correct. The mistake was not considering the symmetry of the function initially. By computing $ f(x) + f(-x) $, you revealed that the sum is constant, which directly implies $ M + m = 2 $. Well done.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher. I understand now.\nTeacher：You're welcome. The key insight was recognizing the symmetry in the function, which simplifies the problem without needing calculus. By showing $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $, you directly obtain $ M + m = 2 $. Always consider functional symmetry in extremum problems. Well done.\nStudent：zzc",
