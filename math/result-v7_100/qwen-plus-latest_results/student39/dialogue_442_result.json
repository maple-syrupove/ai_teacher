    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：0\nTeacher：You’ve answered 0. Let’s think: in the expansion of $(x-y)(x+y)^8$, how do you obtain a term with $x^2 y^7$? Consider which terms from $(x+y)^8$ can combine with $x$ or $-y$ from the first factor to produce $x^2 y^7$. What degree term from $(x+y)^8$ would you need?\nStudent：From $(x+y)^8$, I would need a term with $x y^7$ if I’m multiplying by $x$.\nTeacher：That’s correct. Now, what is the coefficient of $xy^7$ in $(x+y)^8$? Recall the binomial theorem: the term with $x^k y^{n-k}$ in $(x+y)^n$ has coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$. What is $\\binom{8}{1}$?\nStudent：$\\binom{8}{1} = 8$.\nTeacher：So the term $xy^7$ from $(x+y)^8$ has coefficient 8. When multiplied by $x$ from $(x - y)$, you get $x^2 y^7$ with coefficient $1 \\times 8 = 8$. But don’t forget the $-y$ term in $(x - y)$. Could $-y$ times some term in $(x+y)^8$ also produce $x^2 y^7$? What would that term need to be?\nStudent：It would need to be $x^2 y^6$ in $(x+y)^8$ if I’m multiplying by $-y$.\nTeacher：Correct. Now, what is the coefficient of $x^2 y^6$ in $(x+y)^8$? Use the binomial theorem: $\\binom{8}{2}$. What is $\\binom{8}{2}$?\nStudent：$\\binom{8}{2} = 28$.\nTeacher：So the term $x^2 y^6$ has coefficient 28 in $(x+y)^8$. When multiplied by $-y$, it contributes $-1 \\times 28 = -28$ to the coefficient of $x^2 y^7$. You previously found a contribution of $+8$. What is the total coefficient? Why did you answer 0?\nStudent：I only tried listing out some terms, and since I didn't see $x^2 y^7$, I wrote 0.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by assuming the term $x^2 y^7$ doesn't appear just because you didn't see it when listing terms. The term **does** appear through two contributions:  \n1. $x \\cdot (xy^7)$ gives $+8x^2 y^7$,  \n2. $-y \\cdot (x^2 y^6)$ gives $-28x^2 y^7$.  \n\nYour error was stopping at 0 without fully analyzing how $x^2 y^7$ is formed in the product.\nStudent：zzc",
