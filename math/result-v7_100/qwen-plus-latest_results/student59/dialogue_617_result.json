    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：D\nTeacher：You chose D: $\\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AB} + \\frac{3}{4} \\overrightarrow{AC}$.  \n\nLet’s examine your reasoning. How did you express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$?  \nDid you consider the correct vector path from $E$ to $B$ using the midpoint properties of $D$ and $E$?  \n\nFocus on the direction from $E$ to $B$: did you account for the fact that $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$ and $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$?  \n\nWhere might the vector signs or proportions have gone wrong?\nStudent：I wrote $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{OB} - \\overrightarrow{OE}$ and thought to use the formula for midpoint, so I tried expressing $E$ as the midpoint of $BC$.\nTeacher：You mistakenly treated $E$ as the midpoint of $BC$, but $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$, not $BC$. Also, introducing an arbitrary point $O$ complicates the vector expression unnecessarily.  \n\nThe error lies in both the reference points and the misuse of midpoint properties.  \n\nWhy did you choose $BC$ when $E$ lies on $AD$?\nStudent：I saw the word \"midpoint\" and reflexively thought of $BC$ since $AD$ is a median. I didn’t carefully trace how $E$ is defined along $AD$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $E$ is on $AD$, not $BC$. Since $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$, and $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, the error arises in how you combined these relationships vectorially.  \n\nDid you express $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ correctly as $\\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})$ before finding $\\overrightarrow{AE}$?  \n\nWhy might using $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\overrightarrow{AE}$ lead to a different result than your original choice?\nStudent：When using $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\overrightarrow{AE}$, I would need to accurately find $\\overrightarrow{AE}$ based on $E$ being the midpoint of $AD$, so it might give a different final vector.\nTeacher：You’re on the right track. Since $ E $ is the midpoint of $ AD $, $ \\overrightarrow{AE} = \\frac{1}{2} \\overrightarrow{AD} $. And since $ D $ is the midpoint of $ BC $, $ \\overrightarrow{AD} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC}) $.  \n\nSo $ \\overrightarrow{AE} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC}) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC}) $.  \n\nThen $ \\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\overrightarrow{AE} = \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{4}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC}) $.  \n\nDoes this result match your original choice D? Where is the sign or coefficient inconsistency?\nStudent：No, it doesn’t match choice D. If I simplify, I get $\\frac{3}{4}\\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{4}\\overrightarrow{AC}$, which corresponds to choice A. My previous signs and coefficients were off.\nTeacher：Your final calculation gives $\\frac{3}{4}\\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{4}\\overrightarrow{AC}$, which is choice A. However, you initially chose D, which has both incorrect signs and coefficients.\n\nThe error was in the vector direction and sign handling—specifically, you incorrectly assumed $E$ was related to $BC$'s midpoint structure directly, and misapplied the vector expressions without following the correct path from $E$ to $B$ via $A$. The core mistake was not recognizing that $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\overrightarrow{AE}$ requires proper substitution of $\\overrightarrow{AE}$ along $AD$, leading to a corrected expression with a **minus** sign on $\\overrightarrow{AC}$, not plus.\n\nThus, your original choice of D had an incorrect sign and coefficient distribution due to misapplying midpoint vectors.\nStudent：zzc",
