    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：y = 3x\nTeacher：You wrote the equation of the tangent line as $ y = 3x $. Let me ask: what is the derivative of $ y = 3(x^2 + x)e^x $? How did you compute it at $ x = 0 $?\nStudent：I didn't actually compute the derivative at $x=0$. I just used the 3 from the original function.\nTeacher：You assumed the slope is 3 just because of the coefficient in the original function. The slope of the tangent line requires computing the derivative using the product rule and evaluating it at $ x = 0 $. Your mistake is not applying the derivative correctly to find the slope at the point.\nStudent：zzc",
