The sequence $\\{b_{n}\\}$ satisfies $b_{1}=1, b_{2}=\\frac{1}{3}$, and $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$.\n\n(I) Find the general term formula for $\\{a_{n}\\}$.\n\n(II) Find the sum of the first $n$ terms of $\\{b_{n}\\}$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\n(I) We are given the recurrence relation $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$, which can be factored as $(a_n+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\nLet's use the given values for $n=1$ to find $a_1$.\nFor $n=1$: $(a_1+1)b_2 = 1 \\cdot b_1$.\nWe are given $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n$(a_1+1)(\\frac{1}{3}) = 1$.\n$a_1+1 = 3$.\n$a_1 = 2$.\n\nWe are told that $\\{a_n\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $d=3$. \nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$a_n = 2 + (n-1)3 = 2 + 3n - 3 = 3n - 1$.\n\n(II) Now we need to find the sum of the first n terms of $\\{b_n\\}$. First, let's find a general formula for $\\{b_n\\}$.\nFrom part (I), we know $a_n = 3n-1$. Substitute this into the recurrence relation $(a_n+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\n$((3n-1)+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\n$(3n)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\nFor $n \\ge 1$, we can divide by $n$:\n$3b_{n+1} = b_n$.\nThis can be rewritten as $\\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThis shows that $\\{b_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with a common ratio $q = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nWe are given the first term $b_1 = 1$.\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula $S_n = \\frac{b_1(1-q^n)}{1-q}$.\n$S_n = \\frac{1(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n)}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{3}{2}(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n) = \\frac{3}{2}(1 - 3^{-n})$.\nThis can also be written as $\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot 3^n} = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^{n-1}}$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：(I) $a_n = a_1 + 3(n-1)$\n\n(II) I couldn't find a general term for $b_n$, so I could not find the sum of the first $n$ terms.\nTeacher：You correctly expressed $ a_n $ in terms of $ a_1 $, but did you use the given recurrence $ a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = n b_n $ and the known values $ b_1 = 1 $, $ b_2 = \\frac{1}{3} $?  \nTry substituting $ n = 1 $ into the recurrence and see what value of $ a_1 $ is implied.\nStudent：Let’s substitute $n=1$ into $a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = n b_n$:\n\n$a_1 b_2 + b_2 = 1 \\cdot b_1$\n\n$a_1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 1$\n\n$a_1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\n$a_1 = 2$\nTeacher：You correctly found $ a_1 = 2 $. Now that you know the common difference is 3, what is the complete general term for $ a_n $?  \nRemember, part (I) asks for a closed formula.\nStudent：The complete general term for $a_n$ is $a_n = 2 + 3(n-1) = 3n - 1$.\nTeacher：You correctly found $ a_n = 3n - 1 $. Now, using this in the recurrence $ a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = n b_n $, can you factor the left-hand side and write a simplified relation involving $ b_{n+1} $ and $ b_n $?  \nFocus on the algebraic manipulation of the left side.\nStudent：The left side is $(a_n + 1) b_{n+1}$, so $(3n - 1 + 1) b_{n+1} = 3n b_{n+1}$.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified the left-hand side to $ 3n b_{n+1} $. Now substitute this back into the recurrence. What equation do you get relating $ b_{n+1} $ and $ b_n $?\nStudent：Substituting, we get $3n b_{n+1} = n b_n$.\nTeacher：You correctly obtained $ 3n b_{n+1} = n b_n $.  \nNow, consider: can you always divide both sides by $ n $? What assumption are you making about $ n $?  \nCheck what happens when $ n = 0 $ — is that allowed? But more importantly, does this relation hold for all $ n \\geq 1 $?  \nRe-examine the domain of $ n $ in the original recurrence.\nStudent：Since $n$ starts from 1 (as $b_1$ is given), $n$ is always at least 1, so dividing by $n$ is valid for all $n \\geq 1$.\nTeacher：You are correct that $ n \\geq 1 $, so dividing by $ n $ is valid. However, your resulting relation $ 3n b_{n+1} = n b_n $ simplifies to $ b_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{3} b_n $ — do you believe this holds for all $ n \\geq 1 $?  \n\nCheck whether this recurrence gives the correct value of $ b_2 $ from $ b_1 $, and then test it for $ n = 2 $: does it produce a consistent $ b_3 $? Use the original equation to verify.\nStudent：For $n=1$, $b_2 = \\frac{1}{3} b_1 = \\frac{1}{3}$, which matches the given value.\n\nFor $n=2$, $b_3 = \\frac{1}{3} b_2 = \\frac{1}{9}$.\nTeacher：You assumed $ b_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{3} b_n $ holds for all $ n \\geq 1 $, but check consistency with the original recurrence for $ n = 2 $.  \nUse $ a_2 = 3(2) - 1 = 5 $, $ b_2 = \\frac{1}{3} $, and $ b_3 = \\frac{1}{9} $ in the equation $ a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = n b_n $.  \nDoes it hold? If not, where did the error occur?\nStudent：Let me check for $n=2$:\n\n$a_2 = 5$, $b_2 = \\frac{1}{3}$, $b_3 = \\frac{1}{9}$.\n\nSo, $a_2 b_3 + b_3 = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nBut $n b_n = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nSo, the recurrence holds for $n=2$ with these values.\nTeacher：You correctly verified the recurrence for $ n = 2 $, but your assumption that $ b_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{3} b_n $ holds for all $ n \\geq 1 $ is based on simplifying $ 3n b_{n+1} = n b_n $, which leads to $ b_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{3} b_n $ only if this relation holds for *all* $ n \\geq 1 $.  \n\nHowever, let’s test $ n = 3 $:  \nUsing $ a_3 = 3(3) - 1 = 8 $, and assuming $ b_3 = \\frac{1}{9} $, $ b_4 = \\frac{1}{3} b_3 = \\frac{1}{27} $,  \nthen left side: $ a_3 b_4 + b_4 = (8 + 1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{27} = \\frac{9}{27} = \\frac{1}{3} $,  \nright side: $ 3 \\cdot b_3 = 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{1}{3} $.  \n\nIt still holds. But consider: does the recurrence $ 3n b_{n+1} = n b_n $ imply $ b_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{3} b_n $ for *all* $ n $?  \nYes — algebraically, it does. So why does this seem consistent?\n\nThe error lies in the derivation of $ 3n b_{n+1} = n b_n $.  \nYou obtained this from $ (a_n + 1) b_{n+1} = n b_n $, and since $ a_n = 3n - 1 $, then $ a_n + 1 = 3n $.  \nSo $ 3n b_{n+1} = n b_n $.  \n\nBut now divide both sides by $ n $: $ 3 b_{n+1} = b_n $ → $ b_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{3} b_n $.  \n\nThis suggests $ \\{b_n\\} $ is geometric with ratio $ \\frac{1}{3} $, so $ b_n = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{n-1} $.  \n\nThen $ b_1 = 1 $, $ b_2 = \\frac{1}{3} $, $ b_3 = \\frac{1}{9} $, etc. — matches.  \n\nAnd you verified it works for $ n = 1, 2, 3 $.  \n\nSo why is there a problem?\n\nWait — go back to the original recurrence:  \n$ a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = n b_n $.  \n\nYou factored the left-hand side as $ (a_n + 1) b_{n+1} $. That is correct.  \nSubstituted $ a_n + 1 = 3n $, so $ 3n b_{n+1} = n b_n $.  \n\nBut now: is this equation valid for all $ n \\geq 1 $? Yes.  \nThen dividing by $ n $ (since $ n \\geq 1 $) gives $ 3 b_{n+1} = b_n $, so $ b_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{3} b_n $.  \n\nThis implies $ b_n = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^{n-1} $.  \n\nThen the sum $ \\sum_{k=1}^n b_k = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^{k-1} $ is a geometric series with ratio $ \\frac{1}{3} $, first term 1.  \n\nSo sum is $ \\frac{1 - (1/3)^n}{1 - 1/3} = \\frac{3}{2} (1 - (1/3)^n) $.  \n\nBut you claimed you couldn’t find the general term — yet your reasoning now leads to one.  \n\nSo where is the mistake?\n\nAh — here: when you said “I couldn't find a general term for $ b_n $”, but now you have derived $ b_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{3} b_n $, which gives a general term.  \n\nBut earlier, when you simplified $ 3n b_{n+1} = n b_n $, you canceled $ n $ — which is valid — but perhaps you failed to recognize that this recurrence **does** define $ b_n $ completely?\n\nSo the real error is not algebraic — it's conceptual.\n\nYou failed to recognize that the relation $ 3n b_{n+1} = n b_n $ **does** imply $ b_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{3} b_n $ for all $ n \\geq 1 $, and thus $ b_n $ is geometric.  \n\nTherefore, your mistake was in **not trusting the simplified recurrence** and concluding that you couldn't find the general term, when in fact you had all the tools to do so.  \n\nThe recurrence **is** sufficient to determine $ b_n $ explicitly.  \n\nSo the error is:  \n**You incorrectly concluded that you could not find the general term for $ b_n $, when the recurrence $ b_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{3} b_n $ directly gives $ b_n = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^{n-1} $.**\nStudent：zzc",
