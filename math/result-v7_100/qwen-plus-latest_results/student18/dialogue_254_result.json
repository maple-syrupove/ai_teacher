    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C.\nTeacher：Why do you think the graph is symmetric about $ x = \\pi $? What does symmetry about a vertical line mean for $ f(x) $?\nStudent：Symmetry about $x = \\pi$ means that for all $x$ in the domain, $f(\\pi - x) = f(x)$. I checked $f(\\pi - x)$ and found it equal to $f(x)$.\nTeacher：Let’s test your claim. Compute $ f(\\pi - x) $ explicitly:  \n$ f(\\pi - x) = \\sin(\\pi - x) + \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi - x)} = \\sin x + \\frac{1}{\\sin x} = f(x) $.  \n\nBut is this true for all $ x $? Consider $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{6} $. What is $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) $ and $ f\\left(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right) $? Are they equal?  \n\nWait — are the *domains* of $ f(x) $ symmetric about $ x = \\pi $? Is $ f(x) $ defined at $ x = 0 $? What about near $ x = 0 $ and $ x = 2\\pi $?  \n\nYour mistake lies in not considering the **domain** of $ f(x) $. The function is undefined where $ \\sin x = 0 $, i.e., at $ x = k\\pi $. So the domain excludes $ x = 0, \\pi, 2\\pi, \\dots $.  \n\nThus, symmetry about $ x = \\pi $ would require that if $ x $ is in the domain, so is $ 2\\pi - x $, and $ f(2\\pi - x) = f(x) $. But check: $ f(2\\pi - x) = \\sin(2\\pi - x) + \\frac{1}{\\sin(2\\pi - x)} = -\\sin x - \\frac{1}{\\sin x} = -f(x) $.  \n\nAh — so actually $ f(2\\pi - x) = -f(x) $, not $ f(x) $.  \n\n**Your error: You confused $ f(\\pi - x) $ with $ f(2\\pi - x) $. Symmetry about $ x = \\pi $ requires $ f(\\pi + t) = f(\\pi - t) $, not $ f(\\pi - x) = f(x) $.**  \n\nTry evaluating $ f(\\pi + t) $ and $ f(\\pi - t) $. Are they equal?  \n\n(Now you should see the flaw.)\nStudent：For $f(\\pi + t)$, we have $f(\\pi + t) = \\sin(\\pi + t) + \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi + t)} = -\\sin t - \\frac{1}{\\sin t}$. For $f(\\pi - t)$, it's $f(\\pi - t) = \\sin(\\pi - t) + \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi - t)} = \\sin t + \\frac{1}{\\sin t}$. These are not equal.\nTeacher：Exactly. So $ f(\\pi + t) = -f(\\pi - t) $, not equal to it.  \n\n**Your mistake: You assumed symmetry about $ x = \\pi $ holds based on an incorrect identity, but $ f(\\pi + t) \\neq f(\\pi - t) $.**  \nThe function is not symmetric about $ x = \\pi $.  \n\nNow, reconsider: could any other symmetry be correct? Think about $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $.\nStudent：Let me check for symmetry about $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. That means testing if $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right)$. I'll compute both expressions.\nTeacher：Compute $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right) $ and $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) $.  \nNote: $ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right) = \\cos t $, and $ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) = \\cos t $.  \nSo both expressions become $ \\cos t + \\frac{1}{\\cos t} $, provided $ \\cos t \\neq 0 $.  \n\nIs this true for all $ t $? Are the domains symmetric about $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $?  \n\nWait — your computation may be correct, but consider: does $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) $ hold when $ t = \\frac{\\pi}{3} $? Try it numerically.  \n\nCheck if $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) $.  \nThat is, is $ f\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) $?  \n\nRecall earlier: $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} + 2 = 2.5 $, and $ f\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} + 2 = 2.5 $.  \n\nSo yes, they are equal. But is this always true?  \n\nWait — your error is not in calculation. You correctly found $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) $ when defined.  \n\nBut is the function symmetric about $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $? Consider the **domain**: $ \\sin x \\neq 0 $, so $ x \\neq 0, \\pi, 2\\pi, \\dots $.  \n\nFor symmetry about $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $, if $ \\frac{\\pi}{2} + t $ is in the domain, then so must $ \\frac{\\pi}{2} - t $ be.  \n\nBut let $ t = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $. Then $ x = \\pi $ is not in the domain. $ f(\\pi) $ is undefined.  \nNow, $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = f(\\pi) $, undefined.  \n$ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = f(0) $, also undefined.  \n\nBut what about $ t = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} $? Then $ \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{3\\pi}{4} = \\frac{5\\pi}{4} $, $ \\sin x \\neq 0 $ — defined.  \nBut $ \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{3\\pi}{4} = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} $, and $ \\sin(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}) \\neq 0 $ — also defined.  \n\nWait — actually, the domain *is* symmetric about $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $, because $ \\sin x = 0 $ at $ k\\pi $, and those points are symmetric about $ \\frac{\\pi}{2} $?  \n\nNo: take $ x = \\pi $, distance $ \\frac{\\pi}{2} $ to the right of $ \\frac{\\pi}{2} $.  \nThen symmetric point is $ 0 $, which is also excluded.  \nSimilarly, $ 2\\pi $ pairs with $ -\\pi $, both excluded.  \n\nSo domain is symmetric about $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $.  \n\nAnd $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right) = \\cos t + \\frac{1}{\\cos t} = f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) $.  \n\nSo the function **is** symmetric about $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $.  \n\nBut your original choice was C. You didn't consider D carefully.  \n\n**Your mistake: You incorrectly assumed symmetry about $ x = \\pi $ based on a flawed identity, without verifying the correct condition $ f(\\pi + t) = f(\\pi - t) $, which fails.**  \n\nNow you see $ f(\\pi + t) = -f(\\pi - t) $, so no symmetry about $ x = \\pi $.  \n\nBut symmetry about $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $ holds. So D is correct.  \n\nWhy did you overlook D initially?\nStudent：I only checked the symmetry for $x = \\pi$ and did not verify option D at all.\nTeacher：Your mistake was **not evaluating all options systematically**. You focused only on option C, assumed it was correct based on an incorrect symmetry condition, and neglected to test option D, which actually satisfies both the functional equation and domain symmetry. Always verify each option independently.\nStudent：zzc",
