If the teacher states an error that does not match your actual mistake, you should deny it and wait for the teacher's next question. If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is 3.\nTeacher：Hello. To begin, what is the equation of the asymptote you used for your calculation?\nStudent：I didn't use the equation of the asymptote. I just calculated the distance from (3,0) to (0,0).\nTeacher：Why did you calculate the distance to the point (0,0)?\nStudent：Because I remembered how to find the distance from a point to the origin, so I used that method.\nTeacher：The problem asks for the distance to an asymptote. What kind of geometric object is an asymptote? Is it a point or a line?\nStudent：An asymptote is a line, not a point.\nTeacher：You are correct. So, the problem requires you to find the distance from a point to a line.\n\nYou have correctly identified that an asymptote is a line. Your mistake was in calculating the distance from the point (3,0) to another point (0,0), instead of calculating the distance from the point (3,0) to a line.\nStudent：zzc",
