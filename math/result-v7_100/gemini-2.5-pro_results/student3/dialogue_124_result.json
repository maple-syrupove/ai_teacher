    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D.\nTeacher：Hello. Could you please tell me the definition of an odd function?\nStudent：An odd function satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Thank you. And what is the definition of an even function?\nStudent：An even function satisfies $g(-x) = g(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Excellent. Let's test the function in option D. If we call it $H(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$, what is the expression for $H(-x)$?\nStudent：$H(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$\nTeacher：Using the definitions you provided, how can you rewrite the terms inside the absolute value, $f(-x)$ and $g(-x)$?\nStudent：Using the definitions, $f(-x) = -f(x)$ and $g(-x) = g(x)$. So $H(-x) = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：How does the absolute value function treat the negative sign in your expression? For instance, what is the value of `|-a|` compared to `|a|`?\nStudent：The absolute value removes the negative sign, so $|-a| = |a|$.\nTeacher：Based on that property of absolute values, what does your expression for `H(-x)` become?\nStudent：$H(-x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$\nTeacher：And how does this expression for $H(-x)$ compare to the original function $H(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$?\nStudent：They are equal, so $H(-x) = H(x)$.\nTeacher：Based on your conclusion that $H(-x) = H(x)$, what type of function is $H(x)$?\nStudent：$H(x)$ is an even function.\nTeacher：You have correctly determined that the function in option D is an even function.\n\nNow, what does option D state about this function?\nStudent：Option D states that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：You have correctly proven that the function in option D is an even function. Your mistake was choosing option D, which incorrectly states that the function is odd.\nStudent：zzc",
