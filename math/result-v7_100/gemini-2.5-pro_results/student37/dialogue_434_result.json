    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I couldn't determine the value of $t$, so I wrote \"cannot be determined\".\nTeacher：Hello. Let's review your work. The problem states that $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}=0$. What is the first step you took to solve this equation?\nStudent：My first step was to expand $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}$ as $t(\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a}) + (1-t)(\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{b})$.\nTeacher：That's the correct expansion. What were the values you calculated for the dot products $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}$?\nStudent：I left them as $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{b}$, without calculating specific values.\nTeacher：What information does the problem provide about vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ that could be used to calculate those dot products?\nStudent：The problem says $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are unit vectors and the angle between them is $60^\\circ$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the given information. How does this information translate into a numerical value for $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}$?\nStudent：Since the angle is $60^\\circ$ and both are unit vectors, $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a} = \\cos 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：Excellent, that is correct for $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}$. And what is the numerical value for the other dot product, $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}$?\nStudent：Since $\\vec{b}$ is a unit vector, $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 1$.\nTeacher：That is also correct. Now that you have the values for both dot products, what does your equation become when you substitute these numbers in?\nStudent：The equation becomes $t \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (1-t)(1) = 0$.\nTeacher：You have set up the equation perfectly. Could you please show me how you proceeded to solve for $t$ from this equation?\nStudent：I didn't proceed further because I thought $t$ couldn't be eliminated, so I stopped there.\nTeacher：You have a linear equation with one variable. Why did you believe that variable could not be solved for in this specific instance?\nStudent：I thought that because $t$ was present in two terms, it couldn't be isolated or eliminated easily, so I assumed it was not solvable.\nTeacher：You have correctly translated the vector problem into a linear equation. Your mistake was purely algebraic: you incorrectly assumed the equation was unsolvable because the variable $t$ appeared in two separate terms.\nStudent：No, my error was not viewing it as an algebraic issue; I couldn't connect the vector information to these calculations.\nTeacher：Thank you for the clarification. In your original attempt, after you expanded the equation to $t(\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a}) + (1-t)(\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{b}) = 0$, what did you do with the terms $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{b}$?\nStudent：I just left them as $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{b}$ without substituting or simplifying further.\nTeacher：You correctly expanded the dot product. Your mistake was that after this step, you did not use the given information—that the vectors are unit vectors and the angle between them is $60^{\\circ}$—to calculate the numerical values for the dot products $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{b}$.\nStudent：zzc",
