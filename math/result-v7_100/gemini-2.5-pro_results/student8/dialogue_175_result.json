    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Hello. To begin, please tell me the result you got when you expanded $(1+i)^2$.\nStudent：I didn't actually expand $(1+i)^2$; I just saw the $i$ terms and picked option A.\nTeacher：Thank you for sharing your thought process. What is the definition of a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：A purely imaginary number has no real part; it's of the form $bi$ where $b$ is a nonzero real number.\nTeacher：That is an excellent definition. Does simply having an 'i' in an expression guarantee that the final simplified value will be purely imaginary?\nStudent：No, having an 'i' in an expression does not guarantee that the result is purely imaginary.\nTeacher：Excellent. Since simply seeing an 'i' isn't enough, let's evaluate the expression you chose.\n\nWhat result do you get when you calculate $(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：$(1+i)^2 = (1+i)(1+i) = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$\nTeacher：That is the correct result for $(1+i)^2$.\n\nNow, what is the final value of the entire expression in option A, which is $i(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：$i(1+i)^2 = i \\times 2i = 2i^2 = 2(-1) = -2$\nTeacher：You calculated the result of option A to be -2.\n\nBased on the definition of a purely imaginary number you provided earlier, does your result of -2 fit this definition?\nStudent：No, -2 is a real number, not a purely imaginary number.\nTeacher：Correct. Given that your evaluation of A did not result in a purely imaginary number, what is your next step in solving the problem?\nStudent：I should check the other answer choices by calculating their values to see if any of them are purely imaginary numbers.\nTeacher：That is a sound approach. What result did you get for option B?\nStudent：For option B: $i^2(1-i) = (-1)(1-i) = -1 + i$. This is not purely imaginary.\nTeacher：That is a correct evaluation for option B. What result did you get when you evaluated option C?\nStudent：Option C: $(1+i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$. This is purely imaginary.\nTeacher：Your evaluation of C is correct. Why are you certain this is the correct choice to answer the question?\nStudent：Because $2i$ has no real part and is of the form $bi$ with $b=2,$ so it satisfies the definition of a purely imaginary number.\nTeacher：Your error was in your initial method. You chose an answer based on visual inspection rather than calculating the value of each expression to determine which was a purely imaginary number.\nStudent：zzc",
