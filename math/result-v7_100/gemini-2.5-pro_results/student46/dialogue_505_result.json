    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is $m = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：Hello. To better understand your thinking, could you please tell me, what are the equations for the asymptotes of this hyperbola?\nStudent：The equations for the asymptotes are $y = \\frac{x}{m}$ and $y = -\\frac{x}{m}$.\nTeacher：Alright. And for the circle, what did you determine its center and radius to be?\nStudent：I found the center to be at (0,0) and the radius to be $\\sqrt{3}$.\nTeacher：How did you arrive at the coordinates (0,0) for the center using the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}-4 y+3=0$?\nStudent：I just matched the $x^2$ and $y^2$ terms and ignored the $-4y$, so I took the center as (0,0).\nTeacher：You incorrectly determined the center of the circle. The standard form of a circle's equation includes all terms, so the `-4y` term cannot be ignored when finding the center.\nStudent：zzc",
