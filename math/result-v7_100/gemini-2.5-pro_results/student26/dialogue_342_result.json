    "question": "17. (12 points) Given that $\\{a_{n}\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3. The sequence $\\{b_{n}\\}$ satisfies $b_{1}=1, b_{2}=\\frac{1}{3}$, and $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$.\n\n(I) Find the general term formula for $\\{a_{n}\\}$.\n\n(II) Find the sum of the first $n$ terms of $\\{b_{n}\\}$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\n(I) We are given the recurrence relation $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$, which can be factored as $(a_n+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\nLet's use the given values for $n=1$ to find $a_1$.\nFor $n=1$: $(a_1+1)b_2 = 1 \\cdot b_1$.\nWe are given $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n$(a_1+1)(\\frac{1}{3}) = 1$.\n$a_1+1 = 3$.\n$a_1 = 2$.\n\nWe are told that $\\{a_n\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $d=3$. \nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$a_n = 2 + (n-1)3 = 2 + 3n - 3 = 3n - 1$.\n\n(II) Now we need to find the sum of the first n terms of $\\{b_n\\}$. First, let's find a general formula for $\\{b_n\\}$.\nFrom part (I), we know $a_n = 3n-1$. Substitute this into the recurrence relation $(a_n+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\n$((3n-1)+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\n$(3n)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\nFor $n \\ge 1$, we can divide by $n$:\n$3b_{n+1} = b_n$.\nThis can be rewritten as $\\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThis shows that $\\{b_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with a common ratio $q = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nWe are given the first term $b_1 = 1$.\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula $S_n = \\frac{b_1(1-q^n)}{1-q}$.\n$S_n = \\frac{1(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n)}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{3}{2}(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n) = \\frac{3}{2}(1 - 3^{-n})$.\nThis can also be written as $\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot 3^n} = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^{n-1}}$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：(I) The general term for $\\{a_n\\}$ is $a_n = a_1 + 3(n-1)$.\n\n(II) I couldn't find a general term for $b_n$, so I can't compute the sum of the first $n$ terms.\nTeacher：Your expression for the general term of $\\{a_n\\}$ depends on $a_1$. Did you determine the value of $a_1$?\nStudent：No, I didn’t find the specific value of $a_1$. I only wrote the general form.\nTeacher：The problem provides an equation relating the two sequences. Can you use this equation with the known terms of $\\{b_n\\}$ to find a specific term of $\\{a_n\\}$?\nStudent：If I substitute $n=1$, I get $a_1 b_2 + b_2 = 1 \\cdot b_1$. Since $b_1=1$, $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$, I have $a_1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 1$.\nTeacher：And what value did you calculate for $a_1$ from that equation?\nStudent：I calculated $a_1 = 2$.\nTeacher：You have the relation $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$. How can you simplify this using your result for $a_n$?\nStudent：I tried plugging $a_n = 2 + 3(n-1)$ into the relation, but I didn't see how to simplify or get a pattern from it.\nTeacher：Let's focus on the structure of the relation $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$. Before substituting for $a_n$, what algebraic operation can you perform on the two terms on the left-hand side?\nStudent：I can factor $b_{n+1}$ out: $a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = (a_n + 1) b_{n+1}$.\nTeacher：Excellent. Now you have the relation $(a_n + 1) b_{n+1} = n b_n$. What expression do you get for the term $(a_n + 1)$ when you use your formula for $a_n$?\nStudent：Using $a_n = 2 + 3(n-1)$, I get $a_n + 1 = 3 + 3(n-1) = 3n$.\nTeacher：You now have the equation $(3n)b_{n+1} = nb_n$. How does this simplify the relationship between $b_{n+1}$ and $b_n$?\nStudent：It gives $b_{n+1} = \\dfrac{n}{3n} b_n = \\dfrac{1}{3} b_n$.\nTeacher：You have found that $b_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{3}b_n$. Does this relationship hold for $n=1$? Can you verify it using the given values of $b_1$ and $b_2$?\nStudent：Yes, for $n=1$, $b_2 = \\frac{1}{3} b_1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$, which matches the given value.\nTeacher：You have performed all the steps correctly during our conversation. Your mistake was in the simplification of the original equation. After substituting for $a_n$, you did not factor out the common term $b_{n+1}$ on the left-hand side.\nStudent：zzc",
