    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $\\{-2,-1,0,1\\}$\nTeacher：Hello. Let's review your work.\n\nTo be in the intersection of M and N, an element must belong to both sets. Let's test the number 1. According to the definition of set M, is 1 an element of that set?\nStudent：Yes, because 1 is in the set N, and I thought it fits in M as well.\nTeacher：Let's look closely at the definition for set M, which is {x | -3 < x < 1}.\n\nWhat does the part of the inequality that says 'x < 1' mean? Does it include the number 1?\nStudent：\"x < 1\" means x can be any value less than 1, but it does not include 1 itself. So, 1 is not included.\nTeacher：You incorrectly included 1 in the intersection. The definition for set M, {x | -3 < x < 1}, specifies that x must be strictly less than 1.\nStudent：zzc",
