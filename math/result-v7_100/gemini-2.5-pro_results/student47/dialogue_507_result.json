    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. [0,2]\nTeacher：Hello. Let's look at this problem together. Could you tell me what the symbol $\\mathbb{Z}$ in the definition of set B represents?\nStudent：$\\mathbb{Z}$ represents the set of all integers.\nTeacher：Very good. And how would you describe set A?\nStudent：Set A includes all real numbers x such that the absolute value of x is less than or equal to 2, or $A = \\{x \\mid -2 \\leq x \\leq 2\\}$.\nTeacher：That is correct. Now, how did you determine the elements that belong to set B?\nStudent：For set B, I looked for all integers $x$ such that $\\sqrt{x} \\leq 4$. So I considered $x$ values where the square root is defined and less than or equal to 4.\nTeacher：Excellent. So, for an element to be in the intersection, $A \\cap B$, what properties must it have, based on the definitions of A and B?\nStudent：For an element to be in $A \\cap B$, it must be both a real number between $-2$ and $2$ (from A) and an integer with a square root less than or equal to $4$ (from B).\nTeacher：That's a very clear description. You mentioned the elements must be integers from set B. How does the notation for an interval, like your answer [0, 2], account for this integer requirement?\nStudent：The interval notation [0, 2] describes all real numbers between 0 and 2, including non-integer values. It doesn’t specifically indicate only integers.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that the result must contain only integers. Your error was in using interval notation, which represents all real numbers in a range, rather than listing the specific integers that satisfy the conditions of both sets.\nStudent：zzc",
