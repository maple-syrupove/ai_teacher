    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $\\frac{1}{2}$\nTeacher：Hello. Let's review your work. What was the first step you took to simplify the expression $\\cos^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$?\nStudent：I used the identity $\\cos^2 A = 1 - \\sin^2 A$ to rewrite it as $1 - \\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$.\nTeacher：That is a correct identity. What formula did you apply next to the term $\\sin(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$?\nStudent：I tried to use the information given, so I thought about relating $\\sin(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ to $\\sin 2\\alpha$.\nTeacher：You mentioned relating the expressions. What connection did you find between $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ and $\\sin 2\\alpha$?\nStudent：I thought that $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ might be similar or equal to $\\sin 2\\alpha$, so I tried substituting $\\sin 2\\alpha$ directly in place of it.\nTeacher：What trigonometric identity or rule led you to believe that $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ and $\\sin 2\\alpha$ are equal?\nStudent：I didn't use a specific identity; I just thought they might be equal since both involved $\\alpha$.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. It is not valid to assume two trigonometric expressions are equal simply because they share a variable.\n\nYour error was making the assumption that $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ is equal to $\\sin 2\\alpha$ without a supporting trigonometric identity.\nStudent：zzc",
