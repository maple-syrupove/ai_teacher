    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C, so I think $a = 1$.\nTeacher：When you set \\(f(-x) = f(x)\\), you derived an equation by cross-multiplying. Can you write the equation you obtained after cross-multiplication?\nStudent：After cross-multiplying, I got: $-x e^{-x} (e^{ax} - 1) = x e^{x} (e^{-a x} - 1)$.\nTeacher：After cross-multiplication, you have the equation:  \n$-x e^{-x} (e^{ax} - 1) = x e^{x} (e^{-a x} - 1)$.  \n\nWhen expanding the left side $-x e^{-x} (e^{ax} - 1)$, what expression did you write for the expansion?  \n\n(Do not solve or simplify further—just state the expanded form of the left side.)\nStudent：I wrote $-x e^{-x} \\cdot e^{ax} - [ -x e^{-x} \\cdot 1 ]$, which is $-x e^{-x} e^{ax} + x e^{-x}$.\nTeacher：After expanding the left side, you have:  \n\\(-x e^{(a-1)x} + x e^{-x}\\)  \n\nNow, expand the right side: \\(x e^{x} (e^{-a x} - 1)\\).  \nWhat is the expanded form of the right side?  \n\n(Only state the expanded expression—do not simplify or solve further.)\nStudent：I wrote $x e^x \\cdot e^{-a x} - x e^x \\cdot 1$, which is $x e^{(1-a)x} - x e^{x}$.\nTeacher：Based on your expansion, the equation is:  \n\\(-x e^{(a-1)x} + x e^{-x} = x e^{(1-a)x} - x e^x\\).  \n\nAfter dividing by \\(x\\) (valid for \\(x \\neq 0\\)), you have:  \n\\(-e^{(a-1)x} + e^{-x} = e^{(1-a)x} - e^x\\).  \n\nYou concluded \\(a = 1\\), but this requires solving the equation.  \n**Your error was equating the exponents \\((a-1)x = (1-a)x\\) without justification, leading to \\(a = 1\\).**  \nThis ignores the full structure of the equation.\nStudent：No, I didn't directly equate the exponents; I just thought $a=1$ looked symmetric, so I chose it.\nTeacher：You mentioned choosing \\(a=1\\) because it \"looked symmetric.\" To clarify, when you initially solved this problem, did you set up the equation \\(f(-x) = f(x)\\) and expand both sides algebraically, or did you select \\(a=1\\) without performing those steps?\nStudent：I selected $a=1$ without performing those algebraic steps or expansions.\nTeacher：Based on your admission, your error was **not using the definition of an even function to set up \\(f(-x) = f(x)\\) and solve algebraically for \\(a\\). You guessed \\(a=1\\) without deriving it.**\nStudent：zzc",
