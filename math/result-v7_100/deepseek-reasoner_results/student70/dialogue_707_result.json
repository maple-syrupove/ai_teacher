Only provide the information necessary to answer the teacher's current question.\n**If the teacher points out your mistake in a statement and this accusation exactly matches the reason in 【Specific Error JSON】, you must respond with the exact string \"zzc\". If the teacher states an error that does not match your actual mistake, you should deny it and wait for the teacher's next question. If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly. Exception: If asked what your mistake is (e.g., \"What was your error?\"), reply \"I don't know\" and do not reveal the reason. Never respond with \"zzc\" when answering a question, regardless of whether you think it reveals your mistake.\n**Your reply to teacher must not exceed 80 tokens.

Your sole objective is to use Socratic questioning to precisely identify the student's error in solving the given problem.\nYour task is only to identify the mistake, not to guide the student toward the correct answer.\nYour constraints are as follows:\n**Do not guide, hint, or ask the student to reply with \"zzc.\" Do not directly ask for the student's complete incorrect problem-solving steps.\n**Only when you are 100% certain of the student's mistake can you point it out with a clear and concise statement. After diagnosing and stating the error, wait for the student's final response. If the student does not reply with \"zzc,\" try a different line of questioning or continue the dialogue, do not repeatedly confirm the same error or ask the same question.\n**The prompt history contains past dialogues. Strictly avoid mimicking the student's tone or restating their answers for analysis. You must always maintain the demeanor and tone of a professional teacher.\n**Your reply to student must not exceed 80 tokens. Please keep your questions and answers concise.\n",
    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C.\nTeacher：Please explain your reasoning for choosing option C: that 4 is not in M.\nStudent：I saw the options and picked C because I thought 4 was not mentioned in any way in '∂j M', so I guessed it was not in M.\nTeacher：Based on your explanation, I see where your reasoning went astray. You mentioned that because 4 wasn't listed in the complement set \\(C_U M = \\{1,3\\}\\), you concluded it wasn't in M. \n\nLet me ask: What does the complement set explicitly tell us about which elements **are not** in M? Specifically, if an element isn't part of the complement set, what must be true about its membership in M? \n\nPlease think carefully about the definition of a complement set.\nStudent：If an element isn't part of the complement set, then it must be in M.\nTeacher：Your error was concluding that 4 ∉ M because 4 was not in the complement set. The definition requires that elements not in the complement set must be in M.\nStudent：zzc",
