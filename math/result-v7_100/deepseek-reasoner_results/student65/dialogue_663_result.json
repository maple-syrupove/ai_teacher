If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose C.\nTeacher：What value did you calculate for the second moment, E[X²], in option B?\nStudent：I didn't calculate the value of E[X²] for option B.\nTeacher：You mentioned not calculating E[X²] for option B. How did you determine the variance for that scenario?\nStudent：I didn't determine the variance for option B because I only calculated the values for options A and C.\nTeacher：Student, you mentioned skipping option B and only calculating for A and C. Did you also skip calculating the variance for option D?\nStudent：Yes, I also skipped calculating the variance for option D.\nTeacher：Based on our dialogue, you skipped calculating the variance for options B and D. How can you determine the largest standard deviation without comparing all four scenarios?\nStudent：I compared only A and C, so I could not accurately determine which option had the largest standard deviation among all four.\nTeacher：Based on our discussion, you compared only options A and C while skipping B and D entirely. How does omitting two scenarios affect your ability to identify the option with the largest standard deviation?\nStudent：By omitting two scenarios, I might miss the actual option with the largest standard deviation because I didn't check all possibilities.\nTeacher：Your error is that you did not calculate the variances for options B and D, making your comparison incomplete.\nStudent：zzc",
