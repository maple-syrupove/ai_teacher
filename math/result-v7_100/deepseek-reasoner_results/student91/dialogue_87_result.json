    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：First, I tried to find the distance between the two vectors, but I got stuck and could not get a reasonable cosine value.\nTeacher：How did you determine which vectors to use when computing the cosine of the angle?\nStudent：I used the vectors $\\vec{a} = (4,3)$ and tried to find $\\vec{b}$ from the equation $2\\vec{a} + \\vec{b} = (3,18)$, but then I moved on to try the distance between $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ to get the cosine.\nTeacher：How is the cosine of the angle between two vectors defined in terms of their components?\nStudent：It is defined as the quotient of the product of their magnitudes and their dot product, but I didn’t use that.\nTeacher：Based on our dialogue, you mentioned attempting to use the distance between vectors without applying the dot product formula. How did you express the vector $\\vec{b}$ when calculating this distance?\nStudent：I found $\\vec{b}$ by rearranging to get $\\vec{b} = (3,18) - 2\\vec{a}$, so $\\vec{b} = (3,18) - (8,6) = (-5,12)$.\nTeacher：After finding $\\vec{b}=(-5,12)$, how did you relate the distance between $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ to the cosine of the angle?\nStudent：I tried to use the distance formula between the endpoints of $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$, thinking it could somehow give me the cosine, but I wasn’t sure how to relate them.\nTeacher：After finding $\\vec{b} = (-5, 12)$, you attempted to use the Euclidean distance between the endpoints without applying the dot product formula or the law of cosines to relate it to the angle. This led to an inability to compute the cosine. The error is that you did not compute the dot product $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$ to find the cosine of the angle.\nStudent：zzc",
