    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C ($(0,2]$) as the answer.\nTeacher：For a=1, what is the sign of the derivative of \\(x(x-1)\\) at \\(x=0.6\\)?\nStudent：When \\(a=1\\), \\(x(x-1)\\) at \\(x=0.6\\) gives the derivative \\(2x-1\\). At \\(x=0.6\\), it is \\(2 \\times 0.6 - 1 = 0.2\\), which is positive.\nTeacher：Based on your chosen interval \\((0,2]\\), which includes \\(a=1\\), and your calculation showing that for \\(a=1\\) the derivative of the exponent \\(x(x-1)\\) is positive at \\(x=0.6\\), the function \\(f(x)\\) cannot be monotonically decreasing on \\((0,1)\\) because a positive derivative at any interior point violates the decreasing condition. Your interval contains values \\(a < 2\\) where this occurs. \n\nWhat is the sign of the derivative of \\(x(x-1.5)\\) at \\(x=0.8\\)?\nStudent：The derivative is \\(2x-1.5\\).
