    "correct_answer": "Solution: (1) We are given an arithmetic sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ with the first term $a_1 = -7$.\nWe are also given that the sum of the first 3 terms is $S_3 = -15$.\nThe formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$, where $d$ is the common difference.\nFor $n=3$, we have:\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + (3-1)d) = -15$\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + 2d) = 3(a_1+d) = -15$.\nDivide by 3: $a_1 + d = -5$.\nSubstitute the given value $a_1 = -7$:\n$-7 + d = -5$\n$d = 2$.\n\nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting $a_1=-7$ and $d=2$:\n$a_n = -7 + (n-1)2 = -7 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 9$.\n\n(2) To find the formula for $S_n$, we use the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$.\n$S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(-7 + (2n-9)) = \\frac{n}{2}(2n - 16) = n(n-8) = n^2 - 8n$.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $S_n$, we can treat $S_n = n^2 - 8n$ as a quadratic function of $n$. This is an upward-opening parabola. Its minimum value occurs at the vertex.\nThe vertex of a parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is at $x = -b/(2a)$.\nFor our function, the vertex is at $n = -(-8)/(2\\cdot1) = 4$.\nSince $n=4$ is a positive integer, the minimum value of the sequence $S_n$ occurs at $n=4$.\nLet's find the value of $S_4$:\n$S_4 = 4^2 - 8(4) = 16 - 32 = -16$.\nAlternatively, we can complete the square for $S_n$: \n$S_n = n^2 - 8n = (n^2 - 8n + 16) - 16 = (n-4)^2 - 16$.\nThe minimum value of this expression is -16, which occurs when $n=4$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $S_n$ is -16.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer: $a_n = -7 -4(n-1) = -4n - 3$\nTeacher：To identify your mistake, let's focus on the common difference \\(d\\). How did you determine the value of \\(d\\) using \\(S_3 = -15\\)?\nStudent：I used the equation $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$, so $-15 + 7 = 2d$, leading to $d = -4$.\nTeacher：Your equation \\(S_3 - a_1 = 2d\\) is incorrect because \\(S_3 - a_1 = a_2 + a_3 = (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 2d) = 2a_1 + 3d\\), not \\(2d\\).\nStudent：I thought \\( S_3 - a_1 \\) would give me \\( 2d \\), so I used that directly.\nTeacher：To pinpoint the error, consider the definition of \\(S_3\\). Using your value \\(d = -4\\), what is the actual sum \\(S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3\\)? Does it equal \\(-15\\)?\nStudent：Let me substitute: $a_1=-7$, $d=-4$, so $a_2=-11$, $a_3=-15$, $S_3 = -7 + (-11) + (-15) = -33$. This does not equal $-15$.\nTeacher：The terms in \\(S_3 - a_1\\) are \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_3\\). Express \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_3\\) using \\(a_1\\) and \\(d\\), then add them. What do you get?\nStudent：$a_2 = a_1 + d$, $a_3 = a_1 + 2d$. Adding them: $a_2 + a_3 = (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 2d) = 2a_1 + 3d$.\nTeacher：Your initial equation \\(S_3 - a_1 = 2d\\) is incorrect. The correct expression is \\(S_3 - a_1 = 2a_1 + 3d\\). How does this difference affect your calculation of \\(d\\)?\nStudent：It means my previous method gave the wrong equation for $d$, leading to an incorrect value for $d$. I should solve $S_3 - a_1 = 2a_1 + 3d$.\nTeacher：Your mistake was assuming \\(S_3 - a_1 = 2d\\) instead of the correct expression \\(S_3 - a_1 = 2a_1 + 3d\\).\nStudent：zzc",
