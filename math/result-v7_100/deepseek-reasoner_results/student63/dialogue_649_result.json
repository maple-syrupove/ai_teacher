    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose D (α and β are perpendicular to the same plane).\nTeacher：To evaluate your choice, can you think of two planes that are both perpendicular to the same plane but are not parallel to each other?\nStudent：Yes, for example, two planes can both be perpendicular to a third plane yet intersect each other, so they are not necessarily parallel.\nTeacher：Based on our dialogue, what is the specific flaw in condition D that makes it insufficient for proving two planes are parallel?\nStudent：The flaw is that being perpendicular to the same plane doesn't guarantee the two planes are parallel; they could still intersect.\nTeacher：Your initial error was selecting option D as the necessary and sufficient condition, as it is insufficient to guarantee parallelism.\nStudent：zzc",
