    "question": "8. (5 points) The Chinese mathematician Chen Jingrun achieved world-leading results in the study of Goldbach's Conjecture. Goldbach's Conjecture states that 'every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes', for example, $30=7+23$. If two distinct numbers are randomly selected from the prime numbers not exceeding 30, what is the probability that their sum is 30?

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is A.\nTeacher：How many prime numbers not exceeding 30 did you consider in your solution?\nStudent：I considered the primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. So, 10 primes.\nTeacher：Based on your prime list of 10 numbers, how did you calculate the total number of possible pairs when selecting two distinct primes?\nStudent：I used the combination formula $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ for the total number of pairs.\nTeacher：You listed 10 primes and calculated the total pairs as $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$. For the favorable pairs that sum to 30, how many did you count?\nStudent：I found only one pair that sums to 30.\nTeacher：You stated only one pair sums to 30. How did you verify that no other pairs of distinct primes in your list add to 30?\nStudent：I checked a couple of pairs like (5, 25), but after seeing 25 isn’t prime, I didn’t look for more cases. I thought only one valid pair existed.\nTeacher：Based on your prime list and admission of incomplete checking, you missed two pairs: 11+19 and 13+17 also sum to 30. Thus, you undercounted the favorable outcomes.\nStudent：zzc",
