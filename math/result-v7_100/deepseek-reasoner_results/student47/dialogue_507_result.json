    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. [0,2]\nTeacher：What does the notation \"x ∈ Z\" mean in the definition of set B?\nStudent：It means that x is an integer.\nTeacher：Based on your recognition that set B contains only integers, consider the following: Does the set [0,2] consist solely of integers? Why or why not?\nStudent：No, [0,2] includes all real numbers between 0 and 2, not just integers.\nTeacher：What integers satisfy the condition $\\sqrt{x} \\leq 4$ in set B? For example, does $x=3$ belong to set B?\nStudent：No, $x=3$ does not belong to set B because $\\sqrt{3}$ is less than 4, but B is for $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and we need integers whose square root is less than or equal to 4.\nTeacher：You stated that x=3 is not in set B, but √3 ≈ 1.732 ≤ 4 satisfies the condition. Thus, x=3 is in B.\nStudent：Oh, I see. So x=3 should also be in B since its square root is less than or equal to 4.\nTeacher：Considering set A is all real numbers with absolute value at most 2, and set B is integers with square root at most 4, what specific integers are in both sets? List them.\nStudent：The integers in both sets A and B are 0, 1, and 2.\nTeacher：Your initial error was choosing the continuous interval [0,2] for the intersection, but set B only contains integers, so A ∩ B must be a discrete set.\nStudent：zzc",
