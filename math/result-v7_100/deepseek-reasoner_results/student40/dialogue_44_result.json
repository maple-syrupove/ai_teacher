    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I used the length of 3 as the diameter, so the radius is 1.5. The surface area is $9\\pi$.\nTeacher：The sphere passes through all eight vertices of the cuboid. What is the distance between two opposite vertices of the cuboid? How is that distance related to the sphere's diameter?\nStudent：The distance between two opposite vertices is the length of the space diagonal of the cuboid. That distance should be the same as the diameter of the sphere.\nTeacher：The student initially used the length of 3 as the diameter but later correctly stated that the sphere's diameter equals the space diagonal of the cuboid. However, they have not yet calculated the space diagonal or the surface area based on that diameter. To identify any remaining errors, the teacher must verify the calculation of the space diagonal.  \n\n**Teacher:** \"What is the exact length of the space diagonal of this cuboid?\"  \n\n*(This question targets the core calculation step. If the student omits a dimension (e.g., fails to include height) or miscalculates the sum of squares, the error will be revealed. The teacher waits to pinpoint the mistake with certainty.)*\nStudent：The length of the space diagonal is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 4 + 1} = \\sqrt{14}$.\nTeacher：The student has correctly calculated the space diagonal as $\\sqrt{14}$, which is the sphere's diameter. However, they initially claimed the surface area was $9\\pi$ and have not yet recalculated it using the correct diameter. To determine if they still hold the initial incorrect surface area or make a new error in computation, the next question must address the surface area directly.  \n\n**Teacher:** \"What is the surface area of the sphere using this diameter?\"  \n\n*(This question tests if the student applies the formula correctly. If they reuse $9\\pi$ or miscalculate $4\\pi(\\sqrt{14}/2)^2$, the error will be exposed. The teacher waits to confirm the mistake.)*\nStudent：The surface area is $4\\pi\\left(\\dfrac{\\sqrt{14}}{2}\\right)^2 = 4\\pi \\cdot \\dfrac{14}{4} = 14\\pi$.\nTeacher：The student initially assumed the sphere's diameter equaled the cuboid's length (3), but the diameter must be the space diagonal of the cuboid.\nStudent：zzc",
