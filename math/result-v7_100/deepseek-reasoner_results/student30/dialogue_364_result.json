    "question": "18. (12 points) A supermarket plans to order a certain type of yogurt on a monthly basis. The daily stock is the same. The purchase cost is 4 yuan per bottle, and the selling price is 6 yuan per bottle. Unsold yogurt is sold at a reduced price of 2 yuan per bottle and is completely cleared out on the same day. Based on past sales experience, the daily demand is related to the daily maximum temperature (in ${}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$). If the maximum temperature is not less than 25, the demand is 500 bottles; if the maximum temperature is in the interval [20, 25), the demand is 300 bottles; if the maximum temperature is below 20, the demand is 200 bottles. To determine the order plan for June, the maximum temperature data for each day in June for the past three years were collected, resulting in the following frequency distribution table:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline Max Temperature & {$[10,15)$} & {$[15,20)$} & {$[20,25)$} & {$[25,30)$} & {$[30,35)$} & {$[35,40)$} \\\\\n\\hline Number of Days & 2 & 16 & 36 & 25 & 7 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nUse the frequency of the maximum temperature being in each interval to estimate the probability of it being in that interval.\n\n(1) Find the probability that the daily demand for this yogurt in June is no more than 300 bottles.\n\n(2) Let the daily profit from selling this yogurt in June be Y (in yuan). If the daily stock of this yogurt in June is 450 bottles, write down all possible values of Y and estimate the probability that Y is greater than zero.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\nThe total number of days in the data is the sum of the frequencies: $2+16+36+25+7+4 = 90$ days.\n\n(1) The daily demand is no more than 300 bottles when the maximum temperature is less than 25${}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\nThis corresponds to the temperature intervals $[10,15)$, $[15,20)$, and $[20,25)$.\nNumber of days with temperature less than 25${}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ = (Days in $[10,15)$) + (Days in $[15,20)$) + (Days in $[20,25)$)\n$= 2 + 16 + 36 = 54$ days.\nThe estimated probability is the relative frequency:\n$P(\\text{Demand} \\le 300) = \\frac{\\text{Number of days with temp} < 25}{\\text{Total days}} = \\frac{54}{90} = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6$ or $\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\n(2) The daily stock is fixed at 450 bottles. Profit Y depends on the demand, which in turn depends on the temperature.\nProfit = (Revenue from full-price sales) + (Revenue from reduced-price sales) - (Total cost).\nTotal cost = $450 \\times 4 = 1800$ yuan.\n\nCase 1: Temperature $\\ge 25^{\\circ}C$ (Demand = 500 bottles)\nSince demand (500) > stock (450), all 450 bottles are sold at the full price of 6 yuan.\nRevenue = $450 \\times 6 = 2700$.\nProfit Y = $2700 - 1800 = 900$ yuan.\n\nCase 2: Temperature $\\in [20, 25)^{\\circ}C$ (Demand = 300 bottles)\nSince demand (300) < stock (450), 300 bottles are sold at 6 yuan, and the remaining $450-300=150$ bottles are sold at 2 yuan.\nRevenue = $(300 \\times 6) + (150 \\times 2) = 1800 + 300 = 2100$.\nProfit Y = $2100 - 1800 = 300$ yuan.\n\nCase 3: Temperature $< 20^{\\circ}C$ (Demand = 200 bottles)\nSince demand (200) < stock (450), 200 bottles are sold at 6 yuan, and the remaining $450-200=250$ bottles are sold at 2 yuan.\nRevenue = $(200 \\times 6) + (250 \\times 2) = 1200 + 500 = 1700$.\nProfit Y = $1700 - 1800 = -100$ yuan.\n\nSo, the possible values of Y are $\\{900, 300, -100\\}$.\n\nY is greater than zero when the profit is 900 or 300. This occurs when the temperature is $\\ge 20^{\\circ}C$.\nWe need to find the number of days with temperature $\\ge 20^{\\circ}C$. From the table, this is:\n(Days in $[20,25)$) + (Days in $[25,30)$) + (Days in $[30,35)$) + (Days in $[35,40)$)\n$= 36 + 25 + 7 + 4 = 72$ days.\n\nThe estimated probability that Y is greater than zero is:\n$P(Y > 0) = \\frac{\\text{Number of days with temp} \\ge 20}{\\text{Total days}} = \\frac{72}{90} = \\frac{8}{10} = 0.8$ or $\\frac{4}{5}$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：The probability is (2+16+36)/6/90 = 54/540 = 0.1.\nTeacher：The total number of days in the frequency table is 90. The favorable outcomes for demand ≤ 300 bottles are the days with max temperature in [10,15), [15,20), or [20,25), totaling 2 + 16 + 36 = 54 days. The probability is calculated as favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, so it should be 54/90. You divided by 6 unnecessarily, leading to 54/540. This is incorrect.\nStudent：Okay, teacher.\nTeacher：For part (2), what are the possible values of Y that you determined?\nStudent：The possible values of Y I determined are: 700, 900, and 500.\nTeacher：For the scenario with demand of 200 bottles, what were your calculations for revenue from regular sales, revenue from clearance sales, and total cost?\nStudent：For demand of 200 bottles:  \nRevenue from regular sales = 200 × 6 = 1200 yuan.  \nRevenue from clearance sales = (450 − 200) × 2 = 500 yuan.  \nTotal cost = 450 × 4 = 1800 yuan.\nTeacher：For the scenario with demand of 300 bottles, what were your calculations for revenue from regular sales, revenue from clearance sales, and total cost?\nStudent：For demand of 300 bottles:  \nRevenue from regular sales = 300 × 6 = 1800 yuan.  \nRevenue from clearance sales = (450 − 300) × 2 = 300 yuan.  \nTotal cost = 450 × 4 = 1800 yuan.\nTeacher：For the scenario with demand=300 bottles and stock=450 bottles, how did you calculate the number of bottles sold at the reduced price?\nStudent：I calculated the number of bottles sold at the reduced price as 450 − 300 = 150 bottles.\nTeacher：Based on your calculations for the demand=300 scenario:  \nRevenue from regular sales is 300 × 6 = 1800 yuan,  \nRevenue from clearance sales is (450 - 300) × 2 = 300 yuan,  \nTotal cost is 450 × 4 = 1800 yuan.  \nThus, profit Y = (1800 + 300) - 1800 = 300 yuan.  \n\nHowever, you initially listed 700 yuan as a possible value for Y. This indicates an arithmetic error in your initial summary of possible profit values for this scenario.  \n\nWhat specific calculation led you to 700 yuan for demand=300?\nStudent：For demand=300 bottles, I calculated profit as (300 × 6 + 200 × 2) − 450 × 4 = (1800 + 400) − 1800 = 400 yuan.\nTeacher：Based on your calculation for demand=300 bottles: you used 200 bottles for clearance sales. However, with stock=450 and demand=300, the unsold quantity is 450−300=150 bottles. Why did you use 200 bottles here?\nStudent：I thought the remaining bottles not sold at the regular price were 200 because I mistakenly matched the clearance sales count to the demand level from another scenario.\nTeacher：Based on your initial list of possible Y values (700, 900, 500) and subsequent calculations, your error lies in the demand=200 bottles scenario. You incorrectly treated the clearance revenue (500 yuan) as the profit, but profit is total revenue minus total cost, not just clearance revenue.\nStudent：I understand, teacher.\nTeacher：For the scenario with demand=500 bottles and stock=450, how did you calculate the profit?\nStudent：For demand=500 bottles and stock=450:\nRevenue from regular sales = 450 × 6 = 2700 yuan.\nNo clearance sales.\nTotal cost = 450 × 4 = 1800 yuan.\nProfit Y = 2700 − 1800 = 900 yuan.\nTeacher：For the scenario with demand=200 bottles and stock=450, what is your calculation of the profit Y?\nStudent：For demand=200 bottles and stock=450:\nRevenue from regular sales = 200 × 6 = 1200 yuan.\nRevenue from clearance sales = (450 − 200) × 2 = 500 yuan.\nTotal cost = 450 × 4 = 1800 yuan.\nProfit Y = (1200 + 500) − 1800 = -100 yuan.\nTeacher：Based on your initial response listing possible Y values as 700, 900, and 500, and your subsequent calculations showing profits of -100 (demand=200), 300 (demand=300), and 900 (demand=500), your error is that you incorrectly included 500 as a possible profit value. This resulted from treating the clearance revenue (500 yuan) as the profit for the demand=200 scenario, rather than calculating net profit as (total revenue - total cost).\nStudent：I don't think that's my specific mistake, teacher.\nTeacher：For the demand=300 scenario, how did you calculate the profit value of 700 yuan in your initial response?\nStudent：For demand=300, I used (300 × 6 + 200 × 2) − 450 × 4 = 1800 + 400 − 1800 = 400 yuan.\nTeacher：For the scenario with demand=200 bottles and stock=450 bottles, what was your initial calculation for total cost?\nStudent：My initial calculation for total cost was 450 × 4 = 1800 yuan.\nTeacher：For the profit value of 700 yuan in your initial response, which demand scenario did you assign it to, and what specific calculation steps did you use to arrive at 700?\nStudent：I assigned the 700 yuan profit to the demand=300 bottles scenario, calculating (300 × 6 + 200 × 2) − 450 × 4 = 1800 + 400 − 1800 = 400 yuan at first, but for 700, I think I used a different clearance amount and summed revenues for 450 bottles at full price and 200 at reduced price, which was not correct.\nTeacher：Based on your initial profit value of 700 yuan for demand=300 and stock=450, you mentioned using \"450 bottles at full price and 200 at reduced price.\" However, this totals 650 bottles sold, exceeding the available stock of 450 bottles. Specifically, what quantity did you assume for regular sales when calculating the 700 yuan profit?\nStudent：I assumed all 450 bottles were sold at the regular price and mistakenly added 200 bottles for clearance sales.\nTeacher：Based on your explanation for the 700 yuan profit in the demand=300 scenario, you assumed selling 450 bottles at regular price and 200 at reduced price, totaling 650 bottles. However, the stock is only 450 bottles, so this scenario is impossible.\nStudent：Yes, teacher, I realize now I made that mistake in my calculation.\nTeacher：Your error was assigning profit 500 to demand=200 (should be -100) and 700 to demand=300 (should be 300).\nStudent：I understand, teacher.\nTeacher：For the probability that Y>0, you set P(demand=500) to 0. However, demand=500 occurs when max temperature ≥25. From the frequency table, how many days have max temperature ≥25?\nStudent：There are 25 + 7 + 4 = 36 days with a max temperature ≥ 25.\nTeacher：For the probability that Y>0, which demand levels yield positive profit?\nStudent：Positive profit occurs when demand is 300 bottles or 500 bottles.\nTeacher：For the demand levels yielding positive profit, you correctly identified demand=300 and 500. Now, using the frequency table, what is your calculation for the probability that Y>0?",
