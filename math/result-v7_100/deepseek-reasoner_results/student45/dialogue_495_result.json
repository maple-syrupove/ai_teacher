    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：2\nTeacher：What value did you compute for |z₁ + z₂|, and how did you use it to get |z₁ - z₂|?\nStudent：I found |z₁ + z₂| = |√3 + i| = 2, so I thought |z₁ - z₂| = 2 as well.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that |z₁ + z₂| must equal |z₁ - z₂|.\nStudent：No, I just saw that both seemed to have modulus 2, so I thought they were the same.\nTeacher：What mathematical relation did you use between |z₁ + z₂| and |z₁ - z₂|?\nStudent：I used the idea that for two complex numbers of equal modulus, sometimes |z₁ - z₂| and |z₁ + z₂| can be equal.\nTeacher：You overlooked the identity that relates |z₁ + z₂|² and |z₁ - z₂|² to |z₁|² and |z₂|².\nStudent：I didn't use that identity; I just compared the magnitudes separately.\nTeacher：Your approach assumed |z₁ - z₂| equals |z₁ + z₂| without justification. What specific algebraic identity must be used to relate |z₁ + z₂| and |z₁ - z₂| when |z₁| = |z₂|?\nStudent：The identity is |z₁ + z₂|² + |z₁ - z₂|² = 2(|z₁|² + |z₂|²).\nTeacher：Your error was assuming |z₁ - z₂| = |z₁ + z₂| without justification.\nStudent：zzc",
