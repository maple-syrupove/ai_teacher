What exact numerical value did you obtain from evaluating the function, and at which specific x-value did you evaluate it?\nStudent：I evaluated the function at x = 0, which gave me y = 0.\nTeacher：To identify your error, what value did you obtain for the derivative of \\(y = 2 \\ln (x+1)\\) at \\(x = 0\\)?\nStudent：The derivative at x = 0 is 2.\nTeacher：Based on our dialogue, you confirmed the derivative at \\(x=0\\) is 2 and used the point \\((0,0)\\). For a tangent line at \\((0,0)\\) with slope 2, the equation must satisfy \\(y = 2x\\) when substituted.  \nYour equation \\(y = 2x + 0.5\\) includes an extraneous constant term of 0.5.  \nSpecifically, the constant term should be 0, not 0.5.\nStudent：zzc",
