    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Let $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1$ and $a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 2$, I let $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ be unknowns, set up equations for them, but couldn’t solve for the answer.\nTeacher：In a geometric sequence, what fundamental relationship exists between consecutive terms?\nStudent：Each term is multiplied by a common ratio $q$, so $a_{n+1} = a_n q$.\nTeacher：Your error was treating the terms as independent variables without using the geometric constraint, resulting in an underdetermined system.\nStudent：No, I didn't treat the terms as independent variables. I tried to use the information given to find the values.\nTeacher：After substituting using the geometric constraints, you obtained two equations involving \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_3\\). What were the left-hand sides of both equations after clearing denominators?\nStudent：The left-hand sides were $a_1 + a_2 + a_3$ and $a_2 + a_3 + a_4$.\nTeacher：Based on your response, you are still treating the terms as independent variables instead of expressing them using the geometric sequence property. Specifically, you failed to write \\(a_2\\), \\(a_3\\), and \\(a_4\\) in terms of \\(a_1\\) and the common ratio \\(q\\).\nStudent：No, I did express $a_2, a_3, a_4$ in terms of $a_1$ and $q$, but I couldn't find a way to proceed.\nTeacher：Based on your description, you expressed the terms using \\(a_1\\) and \\(q\\) but could not proceed. Your error was not recognizing that the second equation \\(a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 2\\) is exactly the first equation \\(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1\\) multiplied by the common ratio \\(q\\).\nStudent：zzc",
