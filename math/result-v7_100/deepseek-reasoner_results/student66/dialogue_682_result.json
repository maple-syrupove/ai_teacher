    "question": "3. During the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control period, a supermarket launched an online sales business and can complete the distribution of 1200 orders per day. Due to a sharp increase in the number of orders, a backlog of orders has occurred. To solve the problem, many volunteers enthusiastically signed up to participate in the distribution work. It is known that on a certain day, the supermarket has a backlog of 500 orders that have not been distributed. The probability that the new orders for the next day will exceed 1600 is 0.05. Each volunteer can complete the distribution of 50 orders per day. To ensure that the probability of completing the backlogged orders and the current day's orders on the next day is not less than 0.95, at least how many volunteers are needed?

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose A. 10.\nTeacher：What is the total number of orders that must be distributed the next day?\nStudent：The total number of orders is backlog 500 plus the new orders for the next day.\nTeacher：The student's initial response focuses on the total orders (backlog + new orders) but does not address the capacity. To clarify the error, I must identify if they overlooked the supermarket's base capacity. \n\nTeacher: What is the total distribution capacity available for the next day?\nStudent：The supermarket can distribute 1200 orders per day, plus the volunteers’ capacity. Each volunteer can deliver 50 orders.\nTeacher：To ensure the probability of completing all orders is at least 0.95, what is the minimum total distribution capacity required for the next day?\nStudent：I think the minimum total capacity should be enough to cover the backlog plus the average new orders, which would be 500 + 1600 × 0.95.\nTeacher：The student's approach uses an average (expected value) calculation for new orders. How did you determine the value of 1600 × 0.95?\nStudent：I multiplied 1600 by 0.95 because I thought it would give the expected number of new orders at 95% probability.\nTeacher：Based on your calculation of 1600 × 0.95, you assumed this gives the expected new orders for the 95% probability scenario. However, the problem states that P(new orders > 1600) = 0.05. What does this imply about the distribution of new orders?\nStudent：It means that 1600 is the threshold: there’s a 5% chance new orders exceed 1600, so 95% of the time, new orders are less than or equal to 1600.\nTeacher：To ensure P(X ≤ capacity - 500) ≥ 0.95, what minimum value must capacity - 500 satisfy, given that P(X ≤ 1600) = 0.95?\nStudent：I think capacity - 500 must be at least 1600 to ensure that.\nTeacher：Based on your initial choice of A.10 and your calculation of 500 + 1600 × 0.95, you incorrectly used the expected value (1520) instead of the 95th percentile value (1600) for new orders.\nStudent：zzc",
