Then, divide both sides by 2 to get $x < \\frac{3}{2}$.\nTeacher：How did you conclude that $A \\cap B$ is empty?\nStudent：Because I thought $x<2$ and $x<\\frac{3}{2}$ wouldn’t overlap as required, so I picked $\\varnothing$.\nTeacher：Your error is concluding that the sets do not overlap because you overlooked that every \\(x < \\frac{3}{2}\\) also satisfies \\(x < 2\\), making \\(A \\cap B\\) non-empty.\nStudent：zzc",
