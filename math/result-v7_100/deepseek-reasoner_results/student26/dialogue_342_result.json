    "question": "17. (12 points) Given that $\\{a_{n}\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3. The sequence $\\{b_{n}\\}$ satisfies $b_{1}=1, b_{2}=\\frac{1}{3}$, and $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$.\n\n(I) Find the general term formula for $\\{a_{n}\\}$.\n\n(II) Find the sum of the first $n$ terms of $\\{b_{n}\\}$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\n(I) We are given the recurrence relation $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$, which can be factored as $(a_n+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\nLet's use the given values for $n=1$ to find $a_1$.\nFor $n=1$: $(a_1+1)b_2 = 1 \\cdot b_1$.\nWe are given $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n$(a_1+1)(\\frac{1}{3}) = 1$.\n$a_1+1 = 3$.\n$a_1 = 2$.\n\nWe are told that $\\{a_n\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $d=3$. \nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$a_n = 2 + (n-1)3 = 2 + 3n - 3 = 3n - 1$.\n\n(II) Now we need to find the sum of the first n terms of $\\{b_n\\}$. First, let's find a general formula for $\\{b_n\\}$.\nFrom part (I), we know $a_n = 3n-1$. Substitute this into the recurrence relation $(a_n+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\n$((3n-1)+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\n$(3n)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\nFor $n \\ge 1$, we can divide by $n$:\n$3b_{n+1} = b_n$.\nThis can be rewritten as $\\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThis shows that $\\{b_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with a common ratio $q = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nWe are given the first term $b_1 = 1$.\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula $S_n = \\frac{b_1(1-q^n)}{1-q}$.\n$S_n = \\frac{1(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n)}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{3}{2}(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n) = \\frac{3}{2}(1 - 3^{-n})$.\nThis can also be written as $\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot 3^n} = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^{n-1}}$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：(I) The general term of $\\{a_n\\}$ is $a_n = a_1 + 3(n-1)$.  \n(II) I couldn't find a general term for $b_n$, so I couldn't give the sum.\nTeacher：Have you used the recurrence \\(a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = n b_n\\) with the given \\(b_1 = 1\\) and \\(b_2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\) to determine \\(a_1\\)?\nStudent：No, I didn't use the recurrence relation to solve for $a_1$. I just wrote the general form for an arithmetic sequence.\nTeacher：The error in part (I) is that you did not determine the specific value of \\(a_1\\).\nStudent：No, I just left $a_1$ as an undetermined constant and didn’t solve for its value.\nTeacher：Have you considered using the recurrence with n=1 and the given \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) to solve for \\(a_1\\)?\nStudent：No, I didn't substitute $n=1$ into the recurrence using $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$ to solve for $a_1$.\nTeacher：The error in part (II) is that you did not compute the terms of $\\{b_n\\}$ due to the undetermined $a_1$.\nStudent：No, my issue wasn't just due to not knowing $a_1$. I wasn't able to find a general term for $b_n$.\nTeacher：For part (II), what specific method did you use to attempt to find the general term of $\\{b_n\\}$?\nStudent：I tried to look for a pattern using the values $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$, but I couldn't deduce a formula.\nTeacher：To find the general term of $\\{b_n\\}$ in part (II), you mentioned relying only on $b_1$ and $b_2$ to spot a pattern. Why did you not compute $b_3$ or further terms using the recurrence? What prevented you from doing so?\nStudent：I wasn't sure how to use the recurrence because it involved both $a_n$ and $b_n$, and I didn't see how to substitute or transform it to get $b_3$. I got stuck.\nTeacher：Did you attempt to isolate \\( b_{n+1} \\) in the recurrence \\( a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = n b_n \\) to express it as \\( b_{n+1} = \\frac{n b_n}{a_n + 1} \\)?\nStudent：No, I didn’t try to isolate $b_{n+1}$ or rewrite the recurrence in that way.\nTeacher：The error in part (II) is that you did not isolate \\( b_{n+1} \\) in the recurrence \\( a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = n b_n \\) to express it as \\( b_{n+1} = \\frac{n b_n}{a_n + 1} \\).\nStudent：zzc",
