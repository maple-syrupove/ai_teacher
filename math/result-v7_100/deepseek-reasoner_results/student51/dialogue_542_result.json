    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I expanded (1 + a x) to get 1 + a x, then expanded (1 + x)^5. For x^2, I took the x^2 term from (1 + x)^5, so coefficient is 10. Equate a × 0 + 10 = 5, so a = 0.\nTeacher：To form an \\(x^2\\) term in the product \\((1 + a x)(1 + x)^5\\), you considered the case where the constant term of \\((1 + a x)\\) multiplies the \\(x^2\\) term of \\((1 + x)^5\\). What other combination of terms from the two factors would also yield an \\(x^2\\) term?\nStudent：Another combination would be when the $a x$ term from $(1 + a x)$ multiplies the $x$ term from $(1 + x)^5$ to produce an $x^2$ term.\nTeacher：Your initial solution only accounted for the term where the constant from \\((1 + a x)\\) multiplies the \\(x^2\\) term from \\((1 + x)^5\\). You neglected the contribution from the product of the linear term \\(a x\\) and the linear term \\(x\\) in the expansion.\nStudent：zzc",
