    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：\\(\\tan\\alpha = \\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\\)\nTeacher：Can you explain how you moved from the given equation \\(\\tan\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}\\) to your expression \\(\\tan\\alpha = \\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\\)?\nStudent：I added \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) to both sides of the equation.\nTeacher：Let's examine your step carefully. You started with \\(\\tan\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}\\). Then you said you added \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) to both sides. \n\nCan you write out the equation after this addition? Specifically, show me the left side and right side separately after adding \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) to both sides.\nStudent：The left side becomes \\(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4} = \\alpha\\).  \nThe right side becomes \\(\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\).\nTeacher：You mentioned that after adding \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) to both sides, the left side becomes \\(\\alpha\\). But the original equation is \\(\\tan\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}\\), not just the argument. When you added \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) to both sides, what happened to the tangent function on the left? Did it disappear?\nStudent：No, the tangent function should still be there on the left side if I only add inside the argument.\nTeacher：Based on our dialogue, your fundamental error is treating the tangent function as linear by attempting to add \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) directly to both sides of \\(\\tan\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}\\). This violates the non-linear nature of trigonometric functions. Specifically, you cannot algebraically manipulate the argument while ignoring the function's properties. \n\nWhat operation should you have performed first to properly isolate \\(\\alpha\\)?\nStudent：I should have applied the inverse tangent (arctan) function to both sides first to isolate the angle.\nTeacher：In your initial step, \\(\\tan\\alpha = \\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\\), what type of quantity is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)? Is it an angle or the value of a tangent function?\nStudent：\\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) is the value of a tangent function, not an angle.\nTeacher：When you add \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) (a tangent value) to \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) (an angle in radians), what mathematical operation are you performing between these quantities?\nStudent：I'm adding a number (tangent value) and an angle in radians, which isn't valid because they are different types of quantities.\nTeacher：Based on our discussion, you recognized that \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) is a tangent value, not an angle. Yet in your initial step, \\(\\tan \\alpha = \\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\\), you used \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) directly as an angle measure inside the tangent function. \n\nWhat specific mathematical object should replace \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) in that expression to represent the angle whose tangent is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)?\nStudent：It should be \\(\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\) to represent the angle whose tangent is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).\nTeacher：Your initial error was treating the tangent value \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) as an angle measure in the expression \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\\), without converting it to an angle using the inverse tangent function.\nStudent：zzc",
