    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：D.\nTeacher：To identify the error in your solution, let's clarify the vector definitions. What is the expression for the position vector of point E when we set point A as the origin? (Recall: D is the midpoint of BC, and E is the midpoint of AD.)\nStudent：If A is the origin, then D = 1/2 (B + C), so E = 1/2 A + 1/2 D = 1/2 * 0 + 1/2 * [1/2 (B + C)] = 1/2 (B + C) * 1/2 = 1/4 (B + C). So, the position vector of E is (1/4)(B + C).\nTeacher：To pinpoint the error in your vector calculation for \\(\\overrightarrow{EB}\\), let's focus on the vector operation step. After setting A as the origin, you have the position vector of E as \\(\\frac{1}{4}(\\mathbf{B} + \\mathbf{C})\\). Now, how did you express the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{EB}\\) in terms of the position vectors of E and B? Specifically, what is your expression for \\(\\overrightarrow{EB}\\) using the vectors \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{E}\\)?\nStudent：I used \\(\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\mathbf{B} - \\mathbf{E}\\). So, \\(\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\mathbf{B} - \\frac{1}{4}(\\mathbf{B} + \\mathbf{C})\\).\nTeacher：Based on your initial choice of option D and your recent vector calculation for \\(\\overrightarrow{EB}\\), let's clarify your initial approach. In the vector expression for \\(\\overrightarrow{EB}\\), what specific vectors did you use to represent the points when you weren't setting A as the origin?\nStudent：I used \\(\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})\\).\nTeacher：Your error lies in the expression for \\(\\overrightarrow{EB}\\). You stated \\(\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})\\), but \\(\\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})\\) is actually the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{AD}\\), not \\(\\overrightarrow{EB}\\).\nStudent：zzc",
