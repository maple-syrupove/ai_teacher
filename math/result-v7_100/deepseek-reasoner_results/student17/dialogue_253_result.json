    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $\\sqrt{5}$\nTeacher：What expression did you use for tan(2C) in your calculation?\nStudent：I didn't use any expression for $\\tan(2C)$ in my calculation.\nTeacher：Based on your answer choice and the problem, let's examine your computation of \\(\\tan B\\). You used \\(\\cos B = \\frac{1}{9}\\) to find \\(\\sin B\\), correct? What expression did you obtain for \\(\\sin B\\)?\nStudent：I didn't actually calculate $\\sin B$; I got stuck before I could find its value.\nTeacher：Based on your initial answer choice and your statement that you got stuck before computing \\(\\sin B\\), I suspect a fundamental misinterpretation of the problem. Let me clarify: \n\nThe given information is \\(\\cos C = \\frac{2}{3}\\), \\(AC = 4\\), \\(BC = 3\\). Note that \\(AC\\) is the side opposite angle \\(B\\), and \\(BC\\) is the side opposite angle \\(A\\). \n\n**Question:**  \nWhen you computed \\(\\tan B\\), did you use the definition or formulas intended for angle \\(C\\) instead? Specifically, did you calculate \\(\\tan C\\)?\nStudent：No, I did not calculate $\\tan C$; I tried to calculate $\\tan B$ directly.\nTeacher：To compute \\(\\tan B\\) directly, you need the opposite and adjacent sides relative to angle \\(B\\). What specific side lengths did you use for the opposite and adjacent sides to angle \\(B\\)?\nStudent：I tried to use $AC = 4$ as the side opposite $B$, but I didn’t have the adjacent side, so I got stuck.\nTeacher：Based on your response that you attempted to use AC=4 as opposite to angle B but lacked the adjacent side (AB), your error is that you did not apply the Law of Cosines to compute the missing side AB using the given cos C and sides AC and BC.\nStudent：zzc",
