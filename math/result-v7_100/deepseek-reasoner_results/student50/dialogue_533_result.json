If the teacher states an error that does not match your actual mistake, you should deny it and wait for the teacher's next question. If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly. Exception: If asked what your mistake is (e.g., \"What was your error?\"), reply \"I don't know\" and do not reveal the reason.

You solved \\(1 + \\frac{b^2}{a^2} = \\frac{5}{4}\\) and found \\(\\frac{b^2}{a^2} = 1\\), but it should be \\(\\frac{b^2}{a^2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\nStudent：I don't think I did that calculation—I just picked the answer based on experience.\nTeacher：Based on your statement that you chose option C without calculation, what specific aspect of the hyperbola's eccentricity did you consider when selecting \\(y = \\pm x\\)?\nStudent：I actually didn’t consider the eccentricity value at all when I chose \\(y = \\pm x\\); I just remembered that form from previous problems.\nTeacher：Based on our dialogue, your error is that you selected the asymptotes without utilizing the given eccentricity value.\nStudent：zzc",
