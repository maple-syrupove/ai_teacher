    "question": "17. (12 points) Given that $\\{a_{n}\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3. The sequence $\\{b_{n}\\}$ satisfies $b_{1}=1, b_{2}=\\frac{1}{3}$, and $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$.\n\n(I) Find the general term formula for $\\{a_{n}\\}$.\n\n(II) Find the sum of the first $n$ terms of $\\{b_{n}\\}$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\n(I) We are given the recurrence relation $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$, which can be factored as $(a_n+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\nLet's use the given values for $n=1$ to find $a_1$.\nFor $n=1$: $(a_1+1)b_2 = 1 \\cdot b_1$.\nWe are given $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n$(a_1+1)(\\frac{1}{3}) = 1$.\n$a_1+1 = 3$.\n$a_1 = 2$.\n\nWe are told that $\\{a_n\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $d=3$. \nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$a_n = 2 + (n-1)3 = 2 + 3n - 3 = 3n - 1$.\n\n(II) Now we need to find the sum of the first n terms of $\\{b_n\\}$. First, let's find a general formula for $\\{b_n\\}$.\nFrom part (I), we know $a_n = 3n-1$. Substitute this into the recurrence relation $(a_n+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\n$((3n-1)+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\n$(3n)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\nFor $n \\ge 1$, we can divide by $n$:\n$3b_{n+1} = b_n$.\nThis can be rewritten as $\\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThis shows that $\\{b_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with a common ratio $q = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nWe are given the first term $b_1 = 1$.\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula $S_n = \\frac{b_1(1-q^n)}{1-q}$.\n$S_n = \\frac{1(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n)}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{3}{2}(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n) = \\frac{3}{2}(1 - 3^{-n})$.\nThis can also be written as $\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot 3^n} = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^{n-1}}$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：For the first part, since $a_n$ is an arithmetic sequence with common difference 3, the general term is $a_n = a_1 + 3(n-1)$.\n\nFor the second part, because the recurrence is $a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = n b_n$ and I only know $b_1=1, b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$, I can’t find a formula for $b_n$, so I can't find the sum of the first $n$ terms.\nTeacher：What value of $a_1$ did you use in your calculations?\nStudent：I didn't use a specific value for $a_1$ in my calculations; I just kept it as $a_1$.\nTeacher：Teacher：But the problem does not provide $a_1$. How is that possible?\nStudent：Because $a_n$ is only described as an arithmetic sequence with difference 3, and $a_1$ is not given, I treated $a_1$ as an unknown constant throughout.\nTeacher：Your assumption that $ a_1 $ is an unknown constant is incorrect. The problem provides enough information to determine $ a_1 $. Have you used the recurrence relation involving $ b_n $ to find $ a_1 $?\nStudent：I didn't use the recurrence relation to solve for $a_1$. I only used the property of the arithmetic sequence.\nTeacher：What happens when you apply the recurrence relation for $ n = 1 $?\nStudent：When $n=1$, the recurrence becomes $a_1 b_2 + b_2 = 1 \\cdot b_1$. So $a_1 b_2 + b_2 = b_1$.\nTeacher：Substituting known values, $b_1 = 1$ and $b_2 = \\frac{1}{3}$, what equation do you get?\nStudent：Substituting, I get $a_1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 1$.\nTeacher：Solving that equation gives $ \\frac{a_1 + 1}{3} = 1 $, so $ a_1 + 1 = 3 $, and $ a_1 = 2 $.\nStudent：Oh, I see. So $a_1 = 2$. Then the general formula is $a_n = 2 + 3(n-1)$.\nTeacher：You correctly found $ a_1 = 2 $. What mistake did you make earlier regarding $ a_1 $?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You assumed $ a_1 $ was unknown, but it can be determined using the recurrence relation.\nStudent：zzc",
