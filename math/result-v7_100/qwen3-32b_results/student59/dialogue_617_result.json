    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：D\nTeacher：Can you explain how you arrived at option D?\nStudent：I thought E was the midpoint of BC, so I used the formula for the midpoint, then wrote EB as $\\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC})$.\nTeacher：Your assumption that E is the midpoint of BC is incorrect. What is the actual position of E in relation to AD and BC?\nStudent：E is the midpoint of AD, where AD is the median from A to BC.\nTeacher：Understood. So, AD is a median to BC, meaning D is the midpoint of BC. But E is the midpoint of AD, not BC. Given this, can you explain how you derived your answer?\nStudent：I used the midpoint formula as if E was on BC, so I substituted the coordinates based on AB and AC, like I would for a midpoint of BC, and got option D.\nTeacher：So you treated E as if it were the midpoint of BC, but E is actually the midpoint of AD. How did this incorrect assumption affect your calculation?\nStudent：Because I thought E was on BC, I never accounted for the step from A to D first, and directly used AB and AC to find EB.\nTeacher：You correctly recognized that you treated E as on BC, but where exactly did this lead to an error in your vector calculation?\nStudent：When writing EB, I used the formula for the midpoint of BC, and wrote EB as if E was halfway between B and C, instead of relating it to AD.\nTeacher：You assumed E's position directly using the midpoint of BC, but E is actually a midpoint along AD. This misplacement caused an incorrect vector expression for EB.\nStudent：zzc",
