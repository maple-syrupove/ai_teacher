Now, can you explain how you used the Law of Cosines with angle $ C $?\nStudent：I didn’t actually set it up with angle $C$; I only tried to set it up with angle $A$ at first.\nTeacher：Then how did you determine the length of side $AB$?\nStudent：I was not able to determine the length of side $AB$ because I got stuck after trying to use the Law of Cosines with angle $A$.\nTeacher：So you were unable to proceed because you didn't use the Law of Cosines with angle $ C $, which is given. Is that correct?\nStudent：zzc",
