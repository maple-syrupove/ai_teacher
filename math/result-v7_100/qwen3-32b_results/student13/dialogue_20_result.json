If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is 1/2.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you arrived at this answer?\nStudent：I thought that after A picks a color, B can only choose from the two remaining colors. So, I set it up as 3 out of 6, or 1/2.\nTeacher：What assumption does your reasoning make about the number of choices available to B?\nStudent：My reasoning assumes that after A picks a color, B has only 2 colors left to choose from.\nTeacher：That suggests you believe one color is removed from B's options. Why do you think B cannot choose the same color as A?\nStudent：Because I thought once A chooses a color, that color is no longer available for B to choose, similar to removing an item from a set.\nTeacher：Ah, I see the issue. The error is in assuming that B cannot choose the same color as A. In reality, both athletes independently choose a color, and there is no restriction preventing them from selecting the same one.\nStudent：zzc",
