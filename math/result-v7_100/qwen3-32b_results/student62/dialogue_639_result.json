    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option C, $c<a<b$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you compared $a$, $b$, and $c$?\nStudent：I looked at the numbers and thought $c$ seemed bigger than $a$ and $b$, so I ordered them based on that intuition.\nTeacher：That approach is not reliable. Can you explain how you determined $c > a$?\nStudent：I saw that $c=0.2^{0.3}$, and I thought raising $0.2$ to a small power would make it bigger, so I guessed $c > a$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined $a < b$?\nStudent：I noticed that $a = \\log_2 0.2$ is negative and $b = 2^{0.2}$ is positive, so I thought $a < b$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined $c > a$ based on the values of their expressions?\nStudent：I just thought that since $c$ looked larger, and $a$ is negative, $c$ would be greater than $a$.\nTeacher：You stated $a$ is negative, which is correct. What value did you use to conclude $c > a$?\nStudent：I didn't actually calculate their exact values; I just assumed $c$ would be bigger than $a$.\nTeacher：Your assumption without calculation is the error. To properly compare $c$ and $a$, you must evaluate their approximate values, not rely on appearance.\nStudent：zzc",
