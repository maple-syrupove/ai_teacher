    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to calculate the answer by using the distance formula between the vector endpoints, but I couldn’t get a reasonable result.\nTeacher：What is the first step you took to determine vector $\\vec{b}$?\nStudent：I set up the equation $2\\vec{a} + \\vec{b} = (3, 18)$, then I tried to solve for $\\vec{b}$.\nTeacher：Teacher：How did you solve for $\\vec{b}$?\nStudent：I subtracted $2\\vec{a}$ from both sides of the equation to find $\\vec{b} = (3, 18) - 2(4,3)$.\nTeacher：Teacher：What is the result of this calculation?\nStudent：$\\vec{b} = (3, 18) - (8, 6) = (3-8, 18-6) = (-5, 12)$.\nTeacher：Teacher：What did you do next to find the cosine of the angle between $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$?\nStudent：I tried to use the distance formula between the points given by $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$, but I couldn’t figure out how to get the cosine value based on that.\nTeacher：Teacher：What formula is typically used to find the cosine of the angle between two vectors?\nStudent：Usually, the dot product formula is used: $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}}{|\\vec{a}||\\vec{b}|}$.\nTeacher：Teacher：What was the result of your dot product $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$?\nStudent：I didn’t actually compute the dot product; I used the distance formula instead and didn’t get a result for $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$.\nTeacher：Teacher：So you didn’t compute $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$. Why did you use the distance formula instead of the dot product?\nStudent：I thought the problem might require the distance between the vectors’ endpoints, so I mistakenly tried to use the distance formula instead.\nTeacher：Teacher：Understood. Your error was using the distance formula instead of computing the dot product to find the cosine of the angle between the vectors.
