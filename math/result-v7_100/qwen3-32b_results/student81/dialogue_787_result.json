    "correct_answer": "Solution: (1) We are given an arithmetic sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ with the first term $a_1 = -7$.\nWe are also given that the sum of the first 3 terms is $S_3 = -15$.\nThe formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$, where $d$ is the common difference.\nFor $n=3$, we have:\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + (3-1)d) = -15$\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + 2d) = 3(a_1+d) = -15$.\nDivide by 3: $a_1 + d = -5$.\nSubstitute the given value $a_1 = -7$:\n$-7 + d = -5$\n$d = 2$.\n\nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting $a_1=-7$ and $d=2$:\n$a_n = -7 + (n-1)2 = -7 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 9$.\n\n(2) To find the formula for $S_n$, we use the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$.\n$S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(-7 + (2n-9)) = \\frac{n}{2}(2n - 16) = n(n-8) = n^2 - 8n$.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $S_n$, we can treat $S_n = n^2 - 8n$ as a quadratic function of $n$. This is an upward-opening parabola. Its minimum value occurs at the vertex.\nThe vertex of a parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is at $x = -b/(2a)$.\nFor our function, the vertex is at $n = -(-8)/(2\\cdot1) = 4$.\nSince $n=4$ is a positive integer, the minimum value of the sequence $S_n$ occurs at $n=4$.\nLet's find the value of $S_4$:\n$S_4 = 4^2 - 8(4) = 16 - 32 = -16$.\nAlternatively, we can complete the square for $S_n$: \n$S_n = n^2 - 8n = (n^2 - 8n + 16) - 16 = (n-4)^2 - 16$.\nThe minimum value of this expression is -16, which occurs when $n=4$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $S_n$ is -16.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$a_n = -7 -4(n-1) = -4n-3$\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined the common difference of the arithmetic sequence?\nStudent：I used $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$, so $-15 + 7 = 2d$, which gave me $d = -4$.\nTeacher：What is the correct formula for $ S_3 $ in terms of $ a_1 $ and $ d $?\nStudent：$S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = a_1 + (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 2d)$\nTeacher：Your expression for $ S_3 $ is correct, but how does that relate to the value you used in your earlier calculation?\nStudent：I initially thought I could find $d$ by subtracting $a_1$ from $S_3$, but that's not consistent with $S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3$.\nTeacher：Then how did you arrive at $ -15 + 7 = 2d $? What is the correct calculation for $ S_3 $ using $ a_1 = -7 $ and $ d $?\nStudent：We have $S_3 = -7 + (-7 + d) + (-7 + 2d) = -21 + 3d$.\nTeacher：Now, using the correct expression $ S_3 = -21 + 3d $ and given that $ S_3 = -15 $, can you show how to solve for $ d $?\nStudent：Sure. Setting $-21 + 3d = -15$, we have $3d = 6$, so $d = 2$.\nTeacher：Your calculation for $d$ is now correct, but this contradicts your earlier conclusion that $d = -4$. What led to the discrepancy between these two results?\nStudent：I only used $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$ before, instead of analyzing the given conditions fully.\nTeacher：What is the correct general term formula for $\\{a_n\\}$ using $a_1 = -7$ and $d = 2$?\nStudent：The correct general term formula is $a_n = -7 + 2(n-1) = 2n - 9$.\nTeacher：You correctly derived the general term formula $a_n = 2n - 9$. However, your earlier assertion that $d = -4$ was incorrect. What assumption or calculation caused you to initially conclude $d = -4$?\nStudent：I assumed that $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$ would give the common difference directly, without checking whether this formula actually fit the context.\nTeacher：Your error was assuming the formula $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$ without verifying its validity in the context of the problem.\nStudent：zzc",
