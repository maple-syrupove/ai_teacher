    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Cannot be determined.\nTeacher：How did you arrive at the conclusion that the value of $t$ cannot be determined?\nStudent：I expanded $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}$ to get $t(\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}) + (1-t)(\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}) = 0$ and thought $t$ couldn't be solved.\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}$?\nStudent：The value of $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}$ is $1$.\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}$?\nStudent：The value of $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}$ is $\\cos 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：Substituting these values, what equation do you obtain for $t$?\nStudent：Substituting, we get $t \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (1-t) \\cdot 1 = 0$.\nTeacher：What is the next step in solving this equation for $t$?\nStudent：The next step is to expand and simplify the equation: $\\frac{t}{2} + 1 - t = 0$.\nTeacher：What do you obtain after simplifying $\\frac{t}{2} + 1 - t = 0$?\nStudent：After simplifying, I get $1 - \\frac{t}{2} = 0$.\nTeacher：What value of $t$ satisfies the equation $1 - \\frac{t}{2} = 0$?\nStudent：The value of $t$ that satisfies the equation is $t = 2$.\nTeacher：Your calculation leading to $t = 2$ is mathematically correct. However, does this value make sense in the context of the vector $\\vec{c} = t \\vec{a} + (1 - t) \\vec{b}$?\nStudent：Yes, if $t=2$, then $\\vec{c}=2\\vec{a}+(1-2)\\vec{b}=2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b}$, which is valid for any real value of $t$.\nTeacher：What do you know about the magnitude of $\\vec{c}$ when $t = 2$?\nStudent：When $t = 2$, the magnitude of $\\vec{c}$ is $|\\vec{c}| = |2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b}|$. To find it, I can expand and calculate the norm.\nTeacher：What is the relationship between $\\vec{c}$ and $\\vec{b}$ as given in the problem?\nStudent：The problem states that $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 0$, so $\\vec{c}$ is perpendicular to $\\vec{b}$.\nTeacher：What does the condition $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 0$ imply about the geometric relationship between $\\vec{c}$ and $\\vec{b}$?\nStudent：It means that $\\vec{c}$ is orthogonal (perpendicular) to $\\vec{b}$ in the vector space.\nTeacher：Is there a restriction on the value of $t$ based on the requirement that $\\vec{c}$ must be orthogonal to $\\vec{b}$?\nStudent：No, as long as $\\vec{c}$ is constructed such that $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 0$, $t$ can be solved accordingly.\nTeacher：You concluded that $ t = 2 $ satisfies the equation $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 0 $. However, the problem specifies that $ \\vec{a} $ and $ \\vec{b} $ are **unit vectors** with a given angle. Does $ t = 2 $ ensure $ \\vec{c} $ is a valid vector under these constraints?\nStudent：Yes, $\\vec{c}$ is still a vector, but its magnitude may not be $1$ unless specified.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes no restrictions on $\\vec{c}$'s magnitude, but the problem does not require $\\vec{c}$ to be a unit vector. Therefore, there is no invalidity in $t = 2$. Why did you initially think the value of $t$ could not be determined?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：Your initial conclusion was incorrect because you failed to recognize that the equation $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 0$ provides a solvable linear equation for $t$, despite $\\vec{c}$ not being constrained to be a unit vector.\nStudent：zzc",
