    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：D.\nTeacher：Can you explain why you think option D is correct?\nStudent：If α and β are both perpendicular to the same plane, I thought that means they are parallel to each other.\nTeacher：Can you clarify what it means for a plane to be perpendicular to another plane?\nStudent：If a plane is perpendicular to another plane, it means every line in one plane that's perpendicular to their intersection line is perpendicular to the other plane.\nTeacher：What does the orientation of planes being perpendicular to the same plane imply about their relationship? Are they necessarily parallel?\nStudent：If two planes are perpendicular to the same plane, I thought that means they have the same orientation, so I guessed they are parallel.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that two planes perpendicular to the same plane must be parallel. Is this always true?\nStudent：No, it is not always true. Two planes perpendicular to the same plane can intersect each other.\nTeacher：Then why did you select option D as the correct answer?\nStudent：I remembered from class that being perpendicular to the same plane somehow relates to parallelism, so I picked D without thinking deeper.\nTeacher：What made you think that perpendicularity to the same plane implies parallelism?\nStudent：I just remembered the spatial orientation rule and assumed that if both are perpendicular to the same plane, they’re parallel.\nTeacher：Your assumption that two planes perpendicular to the same plane must be parallel is incorrect. In fact, they can intersect. Therefore, option D is not a necessary and sufficient condition for plane parallelism.\nStudent：zzc",
