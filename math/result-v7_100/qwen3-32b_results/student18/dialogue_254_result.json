    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose C.\nTeacher：Why do you believe the graph is symmetric with respect to $ x = \\pi $?\nStudent：Because when I calculate $f(\\pi-x)$, I get $f(\\pi-x)=\\sin x + \\frac{1}{\\sin x}$, which equals $f(x)$.\nTeacher：What is $ f(\\pi - x) $ in terms of the original function?\nStudent：$f(\\pi-x)=\\sin(\\pi-x)+\\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi-x)}=\\sin x+\\frac{1}{\\sin x}=f(x)$.\nTeacher：What does this result imply about the symmetry of the graph?\nStudent：This result implies that the graph is symmetric about the line $x = \\pi$.\nTeacher：Your conclusion about the symmetry is based on $ f(\\pi - x) = f(x) $. What kind of symmetry does this equality specifically indicate?\nStudent：This equality means the function is symmetric with respect to the line $x = \\pi$.\nTeacher：Is this the correct interpretation of symmetry about a vertical line?\nStudent：I'm not sure—I thought $f(\\pi-x)=f(x)$ meant symmetry about $x=\\pi$.\nTeacher：What is the correct condition for symmetry about a vertical line $ x = a $?\nStudent：The correct condition is $f(a+x) = f(a-x)$ for symmetry about $x = a$.\nTeacher：Now that we’ve established the correct condition for symmetry about $ x = a $, does your earlier calculation satisfy this condition?\nStudent：No, my calculation used $f(\\pi-x)=f(x)$, but for symmetry about $x=\\pi$, I need $f(\\pi+x)=f(\\pi-x)$. I didn’t check that.\nTeacher：What is the relationship between $ f(\\pi + x) $ and $ f(\\pi - x) $ for this function?\nStudent：For this function, $f(\\pi + x) = -\\sin x - \\frac{1}{\\sin x}$, while $f(\\pi - x) = \\sin x + \\frac{1}{\\sin x}$. They are not equal.\nTeacher：You have now identified the mistake: initially, you incorrectly associated $ f(\\pi - x) = f(x) $ with symmetry about $ x = \\pi $, but the correct condition is $ f(\\pi + x) = f(\\pi - x) $, which does not hold.\nStudent：zzc",
