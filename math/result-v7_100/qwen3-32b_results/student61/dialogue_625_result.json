    "question": "8. (5 points) The Chinese mathematician Chen Jingrun achieved world-leading results in the study of Goldbach's Conjecture. Goldbach's Conjecture states that 'every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes', for example, $30=7+23$. If two distinct numbers are randomly selected from the prime numbers not exceeding 30, what is the probability that their sum is 30?

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is A.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined the total number of possible pairs?\nStudent：I listed all the primes up to 30 and then counted the number of unordered pairs, which is 10 choose 2, so 45 possible pairs.\nTeacher：Teacher：What primes did you include in your list?\nStudent：I included 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29 in my list of primes up to 30.\nTeacher：How many valid pairs did you find that sum to 30?\nStudent：I found only one valid pair, which was (7, 23).\nTeacher：Then you must have made an error in identifying all possible pairs that sum to 30. Can you explain why you concluded only (7, 23) is valid?\nStudent：I just checked the pairs quickly and only noticed (7, 23) added up to 30, so I didn't look for more.\nTeacher：Can you verify if (13, 17) also sums to 30 and consists of primes from your list?\nStudent：Oh, you're right—13 and 17 are both on my list, and 13 + 17 = 30. That’s another valid pair.\nTeacher：So, how many valid pairs summing to 30 did you initially consider?\nStudent：I only considered one valid pair at first, which was (7, 23).\nTeacher：Then how many valid pairs are there in total based on your corrected observation?\nStudent：Based on the corrected observation, there are two valid pairs: (7, 23) and (13, 17), both sum to 30.\nTeacher：What about the pair (11, 19)? Does it also sum to 30 and consist of primes from your list?\nStudent：Yes, 11 and 19 are also both primes from my list, and 11 + 19 = 30. So that's another valid pair.\nTeacher：Therefore, how many valid pairs summing to 30 have you now identified?\nStudent：Now I have identified three valid pairs: (7, 23), (13, 17), and (11, 19).\nTeacher：Therefore, what was your initial count of valid pairs, and how does it differ from the actual count?\nStudent：My initial count was one valid pair, but the actual count is three valid pairs.\nTeacher：Therefore, what was the error in your original probability calculation?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You counted only one valid pair instead of the correct total of three valid pairs.\nStudent：zzc",
