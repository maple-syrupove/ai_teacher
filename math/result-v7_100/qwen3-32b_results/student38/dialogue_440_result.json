    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$\\sin\\theta+\\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{2} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{5}$.\nTeacher：How did you determine the value of $\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta$ from $\\tan\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$?\nStudent：I used the R-formula: $\\sin\\theta+\\cos\\theta=\\sqrt{2}\\sin(\\theta+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$. I set $\\sin(\\theta+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ equal to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$ based on the given tangent.\nTeacher：How did you determine $\\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$ from the given tangent value?\nStudent：I thought that since $\\tan(\\theta+\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{2}$, then $\\sin(\\theta+\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+2^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$.\nTeacher：Teacher：Why is $\\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ necessarily positive?\nStudent：Because in the second quadrant, $\\theta+\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ could be in the first or second quadrant, so $\\sin(\\theta+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ could be positive.\nTeacher：Your reasoning is flawed. Since $\\theta$ is in the second quadrant, determine the actual quadrant of $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and reassess the sign of $\\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$.\nStudent：Okay, if $\\theta$ is in the second quadrant, then $\\frac{\\pi}{2}<\\theta<\\pi$, so $\\frac{3\\pi}{4}<\\theta+\\frac{\\pi}{4}<\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$. Thus, $\\theta+\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ is in the second or third quadrant. So $\\sin(\\theta+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ could be positive or negative depending on the specific value.\nTeacher：Given that $\\tan\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$ is positive, in which quadrants can $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ lie?\nStudent：Since tangent is positive in the first and third quadrants, $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ must be in either the first or third quadrant.\nTeacher：But earlier you concluded $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ is in the second or third quadrant. What does this imply about its actual quadrant?\nStudent：That means $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ must be in the third quadrant.\nTeacher：Correct. Now, how does this affect the sign of $\\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$?\nStudent：Since the third quadrant, $\\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ would be negative.\nTeacher：So, what mistake did you make earlier in determining the sign of $\\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You assumed $\\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ was positive without considering the correct quadrant. It should be negative.\nStudent：zzc",
