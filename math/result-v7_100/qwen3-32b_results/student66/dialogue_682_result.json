    "question": "3. During the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control period, a supermarket launched an online sales business and can complete the distribution of 1200 orders per day. Due to a sharp increase in the number of orders, a backlog of orders has occurred. To solve the problem, many volunteers enthusiastically signed up to participate in the distribution work. It is known that on a certain day, the supermarket has a backlog of 500 orders that have not been distributed. The probability that the new orders for the next day will exceed 1600 is 0.05. Each volunteer can complete the distribution of 50 orders per day. To ensure that the probability of completing the backlogged orders and the current day's orders on the next day is not less than 0.95, at least how many volunteers are needed?

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. 10\nTeacher：To achieve a 0.95 probability of clearing the backlog and current day's orders, why did you choose 10 volunteers? How did you calculate the total orders that need to be processed?\nStudent：I calculated the total as 500 backlog plus an average of 1600 new orders, then multiplied the 1600 by 0.95 to adjust for the probability, subtracted the daily capacity of 1200, and then divided by 50.\nTeacher：Your approach to calculating the total orders seems inconsistent with probability principles. Why did you multiply 1600 by 0.95 instead of considering the probabilistic threshold directly?\nStudent：I thought multiplying by 0.95 would give the expected number of new orders that fit within the probability limit.\nTeacher：That reasoning is flawed. Multiplying by 0.95 does not adjust for the probabilistic threshold; it misrepresents the relationship between expected value and probability constraints. What assumption does a 0.95 probability imply about the maximum number of new orders to expect?\nStudent：It means that the number of new orders should not exceed 1600 with a probability of at least 0.95.\nTeacher：Correct. The 0.95 probability implies that the number of new orders will not exceed a certain threshold—specifically, 1600—with at least 95% confidence. How did you use this threshold in your calculation?\nStudent：I didn’t use the threshold directly. Instead, I worked with averages and expected values rather than planning for the maximum possible orders within the probability guarantee.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that the threshold is 1600 orders, but your calculation did not account for this threshold directly. By using averages instead of planning for the maximum number of orders within the 95% probability guarantee, you underestimated the required capacity.\nStudent：zzc",
