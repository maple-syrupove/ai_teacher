    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：\\(\\tan\\alpha = \\tan \\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\\)\nTeacher：Your approach seems to directly assign $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$, but is this the only possibility for $\\alpha$ satisfying the original equation?\nStudent：There might be more possibilities since the tangent function is periodic, but I thought adding $\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ to both sides was enough.\nTeacher：What identity or formula should be used to expand $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4})$ before solving for $\\tan \\alpha$?\nStudent：I think I should use the tangent addition or subtraction formula: \\(\\tan(A - B) = \\frac{\\tan A - \\tan B}{1 + \\tan A \\tan B}\\).\nTeacher：Excellent. Then how is $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4})$ specifically expanded using this formula?\nStudent：It expands as \\(\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{\\tan\\alpha - \\tan\\frac{5\\pi}{4}}{1 + \\tan\\alpha \\tan\\frac{5\\pi}{4}}\\).\nTeacher：Correct. Now, what is the value of $\\tan\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$?\nStudent：\\(\\tan\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) equals \\(1\\).\nTeacher：Incorrect. What is the exact value of $\\tan\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$?\nStudent：\\(\\tan\\frac{5\\pi}{4} = 1\\)\nTeacher：Incorrect. What is the exact value of $\\tan\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$?\nStudent：\\(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) is in the third quadrant, so \\(\\tan\\frac{5\\pi}{4} = 1\\).\nTeacher：What is the tangent of $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$, and how does the quadrant affect its sign?\nStudent：The tangent of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) is \\(1\\), and in the third quadrant, tangent is positive, so \\(\\tan\\frac{5\\pi}{4} = 1\\).\nTeacher：Teacher：Correct on the value and sign. Then why does $\\tan\\frac{5\\pi}{4} = 1$ contradict your earlier conclusion?\nStudent：Because earlier, I plugged in \\( \\tan\\frac{5\\pi}{4} \\) as if it were part of the variable side, but using the formula and knowing \\( \\tan\\frac{5\\pi}{4} = 1 \\), I should have substituted this value into the addition formula.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $\\tan\\frac{5\\pi}{4} = 1$, but you failed to substitute this value into your earlier formula for $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4})$. What does the formula now become after this substitution?\nStudent：After substitution, the formula becomes \\(\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{\\tan\\alpha - 1}{1 + \\tan\\alpha \\cdot 1} = \\frac{\\tan\\alpha - 1}{1 + \\tan\\alpha}\\).\nTeacher：Given that $\\tan\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}$, what equation does this substitution lead to?\nStudent：This gives \\(\\frac{\\tan\\alpha - 1}{1 + \\tan\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{5}\\).\nTeacher：Correct. Now, what is the next step in solving for $\\tan\\alpha$?\nStudent：The next step is to cross-multiply: \\(5(\\tan\\alpha - 1) = 1 + \\tan\\alpha\\).\nTeacher：Correct. What does this equation simplify to?\nStudent：It simplifies to \\(5\\tan\\alpha - 5 = 1 + \\tan\\alpha\\).\nTeacher：Correct. Now, what is the result after moving all terms involving $\\tan\\alpha$ to one side and constants to the other?\nStudent：Bringing terms together, \\(5\\tan\\alpha - \\tan\\alpha = 1 + 5\\), so \\(4\\tan\\alpha = 6\\).\nTeacher：Correct. Then what is the final value of $\\tan\\alpha$ according to this?\nStudent：\\(\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\nTeacher：Your calculation leads to $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$. However, does this satisfy the original equation $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}$?\nStudent：Let me check:\n\\[\n\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{\\tan\\alpha - 1}{1 + \\tan\\alpha}\n\\]\nIf \\(\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}\\):\n\n\\(\n\\frac{\\frac{3}{2} - 1}{1 + \\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{5}{2}} = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\)\n\nSo yes, it satisfies the original equation.\nTeacher：Your calculation is correct, and $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$ indeed satisfies the original equation. There is no mistake in your final answer.\nStudent：Okay, thank you.\nTeacher：You're welcome. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher!\nTeacher：You're welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\nStudent：\\tan\\alpha = \\tan \\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\nTeacher：Your initial approach incorrectly assumes $\\tan(\\alpha - \\beta) = \\frac{1}{5}$ implies $\\alpha = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) + \\beta$, which is not a valid property of the tangent function. This is the primary error in your reasoning.\nStudent：zzc",
