    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A. $\\{-2,-1,0,1\\}$.\nTeacher：Let’s examine the set M more closely. What values of x satisfy -3 < x < 1? Is the number 1 included in this interval?\nStudent：No, the number 1 is not included in the interval $-3 < x < 1$.\nTeacher：Good. Then why is 1 included in your answer A?\nStudent：Because 1 is also in set N, so I thought it should be included.\nTeacher：Teacher：But for a number to be in the intersection, it must satisfy both conditions. Does 1 satisfy -3 < x < 1?\nStudent：No, 1 does not satisfy $-3 < x < 1$.\nTeacher：Then why did you include 1 in your answer?\nStudent：Because I saw 1 was present in both sets, so I included it without thinking about the strictness of the interval.\nTeacher：So you now recognize that 1 is not in set M, and thus cannot be in the intersection. What elements of N do satisfy -3 < x < 1?\nStudent：The elements $-2$, $-1$, and $0$ from set N satisfy $-3 < x < 1$.\nTeacher：Excellent. Then what should the correct intersection be?\nStudent：The correct intersection should be $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$.\nTeacher：Correct. The mistake was including 1 in the intersection, as it does not satisfy the strict inequality -3 < x < 1.\nStudent：zzc",
