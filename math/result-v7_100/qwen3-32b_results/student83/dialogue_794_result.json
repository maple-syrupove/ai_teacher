    "question": "17. The sides opposite to the interior angles A, B, C of $\\triangle ABC$ are $a, b, c$ respectively. Suppose $(\\sin B-\\sin C)^{2}=\\sin ^{2} A-\\sin B \\sin C$.\n\n(1) Find the measure of angle A.\n\n(2) If $\\sqrt{2} a+b=2 c$, find $\\sin C$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "【Detailed Explanation】(1) We are given the equation $(\\sin B-\\sin C)^{2}=\\sin ^{2} A-\\sin B \\sin C$.\nExpand the left side:\n$\\sin^2 B - 2\\sin B \\sin C + \\sin^2 C = \\sin^2 A - \\sin B \\sin C$.\nRearrange the terms to group the squares on one side:\n$\\sin^2 B + \\sin^2 C - \\sin^2 A = 2\\sin B \\sin C - \\sin B \\sin C$\n$\\sin^2 B + \\sin^2 C - \\sin^2 A = \\sin B \\sin C$.\n\nBy the Law of Sines, $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C} = k$. So, $\\sin A = a/k, \\sin B = b/k, \\sin C = c/k$.\nSubstitute these into the equation:\n$(b/k)^2 + (c/k)^2 - (a/k)^2 = (b/k)(c/k)$.\nMultiply the entire equation by $k^2$:\n$b^2 + c^2 - a^2 = bc$.\n\nFrom the Law of Cosines, we know that $\\cos A = \\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}$.\nSubstitute the result we just found:\n$\\cos A = \\frac{bc}{2bc} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince A is an angle in a triangle, $A \\in (0, \\pi)$. The angle A for which $\\cos A = 1/2$ is $A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\n(2) We are given $\\sqrt{2} a+b=2 c$. Using the Law of Sines again, this becomes:\n$\\sqrt{2}k\\sin A + k\\sin B = 2k\\sin C$.\n$\\sqrt{2}\\sin A + \\sin B = 2\\sin C$.\nWe know $A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and $B = \\pi - (A+C) = \\pi - (\\frac{\\pi}{3}+C)$.\nSo, $\\sin B = \\sin(\\pi - (\\frac{\\pi}{3}+C)) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}+C) = \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\cos C + \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\sin C = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos C + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin C$.\n\nSubstitute $\\sin A = \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and the expression for $\\sin B$ into the equation:\n$\\sqrt{2}(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos C + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin C) = 2\\sin C$.\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos C = 2\\sin C - \\frac{1}{2}\\sin C = \\frac{3}{2}\\sin C$.\nMultiply by 2: $\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{3}\\cos C = 3\\sin C$.\n$3\\sin C - \\sqrt{3}\\cos C = \\sqrt{6}$.\n\nWe can solve this using the R-formula, $R\\sin(C-\\alpha)$. Here $R = \\sqrt{3^2 + (-\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{9+3} = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n$2\\sqrt{3}(\\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\sin C - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\cos C) = \\sqrt{6}$.\n$2\\sqrt{3}(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\sin C - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos C) = \\sqrt{6}$.\n$2\\sqrt{3}\\sin(C - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\sqrt{6}$.\n$\\sin(C - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\nSince $A=\\frac{\\pi}{3}$, we have $0 < C < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, so $-\\frac{\\pi}{6} < C-\\frac{\\pi}{6} < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nIn this range, the only solution to $\\sin(C - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ is $C - \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n$C = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{3\\pi+2\\pi}{12} = \\frac{5\\pi}{12}$.\n\nWe need to find $\\sin C = \\sin(\\frac{5\\pi}{12})$.\n$\\sin(\\frac{5\\pi}{12}) = \\sin(75^{\\circ}) = \\sin(45^{\\circ}+30^{\\circ}) = \\sin 45^{\\circ}\\cos 30^{\\circ} + \\cos 45^{\\circ}\\sin 30^{\\circ}$\n$= \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{4}$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：For part (2), I have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2}a + b = 2c \\\\\n\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{b}{a} = 2\\frac{c}{a}\n\\]\nTeacher：Why did you replace $a$ with 1 in your equation?\nStudent：I didn't actually set $a=1$; I just divided both sides by $a$ to get $\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{b}{a} = 2\\frac{c}{a}$.\nTeacher：Teacher：Okay, you divided both sides by $a$, so you are working with ratios. What do these ratios represent in the context of triangle trigonometry?\nStudent：I think $\\frac{b}{a}$ and $\\frac{c}{a}$ represent ratios of the triangle sides, maybe related to the Law of Sines?\nTeacher：Good. How does the Law of Sines relate the sides and angles of triangle ABC?\nStudent：The Law of Sines states that $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}$ for triangle ABC.\nTeacher：So, if $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}$, then what expressions can you use to replace $\\frac{b}{a}$ and $\\frac{c}{a}$ in your equation?\nStudent：I can replace $\\frac{b}{a}$ with $\\frac{\\sin B}{\\sin A}$ and $\\frac{c}{a}$ with $\\frac{\\sin C}{\\sin A}$.\nTeacher：Substitute these into your equation and examine the resulting expression. What does this substitution yield?\nStudent：After substitution, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{\\sin B}{\\sin A} = 2\\frac{\\sin C}{\\sin A}\n\\]\nTeacher：What do you know about angle A from part (1) that could simplify this equation?\nStudent：From part (1), I found that angle $A = 90^\\circ$, so $\\sin A = 1$.\nTeacher：Substituting $\\sin A = 1$ simplifies the equation. What does your equation look like now?\nStudent：The equation becomes: \n\\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\sin B = 2\\sin C\n\\]\nTeacher：Now you have $\\sqrt{2} + \\sin B = 2\\sin C$. How is angle $B$ related to angle $C$ in a triangle where angle $A = 90^\\circ$?\nStudent：Since $A = 90^\\circ$, we have $B + C = 90^\\circ$, so $B = 90^\\circ - C$.\nTeacher：What is $\\sin B$ in terms of angle $C$ if $B = 90^\\circ - C$?\nStudent：$\\sin B = \\sin(90^\\circ - C) = \\cos C$\nTeacher：Substitute $\\sin B = \\cos C$ into your equation. What does this substitution yield?\nStudent：Substituting, I get:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\cos C = 2\\sin C\n\\]\nTeacher：Now you have $\\sqrt{2} + \\cos C = 2\\sin C$. What identity relates $\\sin C$ and $\\cos C$ that might help here?\nStudent：The Pythagorean identity: $\\sin^2 C + \\cos^2 C = 1$.\nTeacher：How can you use the identity $\\sin^2 C + \\cos^2 C = 1$ with your equation $\\sqrt{2} + \\cos C = 2\\sin C$?\nStudent：I can express $\\cos C$ as $\\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 C}$ and substitute into the equation to get everything in terms of $\\sin C$.\nTeacher：That approach introduces a square root and complicates the equation. Instead, consider rearranging your original equation to isolate terms and then squaring both sides. What happens if you isolate $\\cos C$ and square both sides?\nStudent：If I isolate $\\cos C$, I get $\\cos C = 2\\sin C - \\sqrt{2}$. Squaring both sides gives $(\\cos C)^2 = (2\\sin C - \\sqrt{2})^2$.\nTeacher：What identity can you use to replace $(\\cos C)^2$ in your squared equation?\nStudent：I can use the identity $(\\cos C)^2 = 1 - (\\sin C)^2$ to replace $(\\cos C)^2$ in the equation.\nTeacher：Substitute $(\\cos C)^2 = 1 - (\\sin C)^2$ into your squared equation. What does this substitution yield?\nStudent：I get:\n\\[\n1 - (\\sin C)^2 = (2\\sin C - \\sqrt{2})^2\n\\]\nTeacher：Correct. Now expand the right-hand side of the equation and simplify. What expression do you obtain?\nStudent：Expanding the right side, I get:\n\\[\n(2\\sin C - \\sqrt{2})^2 = 4(\\sin C)^2 - 4\\sqrt{2}\\sin C + 2\n\\]\nTeacher：Now substitute this back into the equation. What does your full equation look like?\nStudent：So the equation becomes:\n\\[\n1 - (\\sin C)^2 = 4(\\sin C)^2 - 4\\sqrt{2}\\sin C + 2\n\\]\nTeacher：Good. Now simplify and collect like terms. What equation do you obtain?\nStudent：$1 - (\\sin C)^2 = 4(\\sin C)^2 - 4\\sqrt{2}\\sin C + 2$  \nMoving all terms to one side gives:  \n$0 = 5(\\sin C)^2 - 4\\sqrt{2}\\sin C + 1$\nTeacher：You have correctly formed the quadratic equation $5(\\sin C)^2 - 4\\sqrt{2}\\sin C + 1 = 0$. However, in solving such an equation, what must you verify about the discriminant to ensure real solutions for $\\sin C$?\nStudent：For the quadratic $5x^2 - 4\\sqrt{2}x + 1 = 0$, the discriminant is $\\left(-4\\sqrt{2}\\right)^2 - 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 = 32 - 20 = 12$. Since $12 > 0$, real solutions exist for $\\sin C$.\nTeacher：What are the solutions to the quadratic equation $5x^2 - 4\\sqrt{2}x + 1 = 0$?",
