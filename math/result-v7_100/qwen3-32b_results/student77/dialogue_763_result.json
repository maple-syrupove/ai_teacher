(12 points) \n(I) Discuss the monotonicity of the function $f(x)=\\frac{x-2}{x+2} e^{x}$, and prove that when $x>0$, $(x-2)e^{x}+x+2>0$.\n\n(II) Prove that when $a \\in[0,1)$, the function $g(x)=\\frac{e^{x}-a x-a}{x^{2}}(x>0)$ has a minimum value. Let the minimum value of $g(x)$ be $h(a)$, and find the range of the function $h(a)$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\n(I) To discuss the monotonicity of $f(x)$, we find its derivative, $f'(x)$. The domain of f(x) is $(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, +\\infty)$.\nUsing the quotient rule and product rule: $f'(x) = \\left(\\frac{(1)(x+2) - (x-2)(1)}{(x+2)^2}\\right)e^x + \\left(\\frac{x-2}{x+2}\\right)e^x = \\left(\\frac{4}{(x+2)^2} + \\frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{(x+2)^2}\\right)e^x$\n$f'(x) = \\frac{4 + x^2 - 4}{(x+2)^2}e^x = \\frac{x^2 e^x}{(x+2)^2}$.\nSince $x^2 \\ge 0$, $e^x > 0$, and $(x+2)^2 > 0$ for $x \\neq -2$, we have $f'(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$ in the domain. The derivative is 0 only at $x=0$. \nTherefore, $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing on $(-\\infty, -2)$ and on $(-2, +\\infty)$.\n\nTo prove the inequality for $x>0$: since $f(x)$ is increasing on $(-2, +\\infty)$, for any $x>0$, we have $f(x) > f(0)$.\n$f(0) = \\frac{0-2}{0+2}e^0 = \\frac{-2}{2}(1) = -1$.\nSo, for $x>0$, we have $\\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x > -1$. \nMultiplying by $(x+2)$ (which is positive for $x>0$):\n$(x-2)e^x > -(x+2)$\n$(x-2)e^x + x+2 > 0$. The proof is complete.\n\n(II) To find the minimum of $g(x)$, we find its derivative $g'(x)$ for $x>0$.\n$g'(x) = \\frac{(e^x-a)(x^2) - (e^x-ax-a)(2x)}{x^4} = \\frac{x(e^x-a) - 2(e^x-ax-a)}{x^3}$\n$g'(x) = \\frac{xe^x - ax - 2e^x + 2ax + 2a}{x^3} = \\frac{(x-2)e^x + ax + 2a}{x^3}$\n$g'(x) = \\frac{(x+2)(\\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x + a)}{x^3}$.\nSince $x>0$, the sign of $g'(x)$ is determined by the sign of the term $G(x) = \\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x + a = f(x)+a$.\n\nFrom part (I), $f(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x>0$. Also, $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(x) = f(0) = -1$ and $\\lim_{x\\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$. So, for $x>0$, the range of $f(x)$ is $(-1, \\infty)$.\nWe are looking for roots of $G(x)=0$, which is $f(x) = -a$. \nSince $a \\in [0, 1)$, we have $-a \\in (-1, 0]$. Since $-a$ is in the range of $f(x)$ for $x>0$, and $f(x)$ is strictly increasing, there exists a unique solution $t>0$ such that $f(t)=-a$.\n\n- When $0 < x < t$, $f(x) < f(t) = -a$, so $G(x) < 0$, which means $g'(x) < 0$. Thus, $g(x)$ is decreasing.\n- When $x > t$, $f(x) > f(t) = -a$, so $G(x) > 0$, which means $g'(x) > 0$. Thus, $g(x)$ is increasing.\nThis confirms that $g(x)$ has a unique minimum value at $x=t$. The minimum value is $h(a) = g(t) = \\frac{e^t-at-a}{t^2}$.\n\nTo find the range of $h(a)$, we express it in terms of $t$. From $f(t)=-a$, we have $a = -f(t) = -\\frac{t-2}{t+2}e^t$.\nSubstitute $a$ into the expression for $h(a)$:\n$h(a) = \\frac{e^t - (t+1)a}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t + (t+1)\\frac{t-2}{t+2}e^t}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(1 + \\frac{t^2-t-2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(\\frac{t+2+t^2-t-2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(\\frac{t^2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$.\n\nSo, the minimum value is a function of $t$: $h(a) = k(t) = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$.\nWe need to find the range of $k(t)$ for the possible values of $t$. \n$t$ is defined by $f(t) = -a$, where $a \\in [0, 1)$. This means $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$. \nWe need to find the values of $t>0$ for which $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$.\n$f(0)=-1$, and $f(2)=0$. Since $f(x)$ is increasing for $x>0$, $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$ corresponds to $t \\in (0, 2]$.\n\nNow we find the range of $k(t) = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$ for $t \\in (0, 2]$.\n$k'(t) = \\frac{e^t(t+2) - e^t(1)}{(t+2)^2} = \\frac{e^t(t+1)}{(t+2)^2}$.\nFor $t>0$, $e^t>0$, $t+1>0$, and $(t+2)^2 > 0$, so $k'(t) > 0$. \nThus, $k(t)$ is strictly increasing on $(0, 2]$.\nThe range of $k(t)$ is therefore $(k(0), k(2)]$.\n$k(0) = \\frac{e^0}{0+2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$k(2) = \\frac{e^2}{2+2} = \\frac{e^2}{4}$.\nThe range of $h(a)$ is $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{e^2}{4}]$.\n",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I started by directly differentiating $g(x)$ using the quotient rule:  \n$$g'(x)=\\frac{(e^{x}-a)x^2-2x(e^{x}-ax-a)}{x^4}.$$\nTeacher：What is the simplified form of the derivative $g'(x)$ after canceling common factors?\nStudent：After simplifying,  \n$$g'(x) = \\frac{e^{x}x^2 - a x^2 - 2x e^{x} + 2a x^2 + 2a x}{x^4}.$$\nTeacher：Teacher：Can you correctly combine like terms in the numerator of your simplified derivative?\nStudent：Combining like terms, the numerator is:  \n$e^{x}x^2 - 2x e^{x} - a x^2 + 2a x^2 + 2a x = e^{x}(x^2 - 2x) + a(x^2 + 2x)$.\nTeacher：Your expression for the numerator after combining like terms is incorrect. Specifically, you made an error in handling the signs or coefficients when combining terms involving $a$. Review your algebra carefully.\nStudent：Let me combine carefully:  \n$e^{x}x^2 - 2x e^{x} - a x^2 + 2a x + 2a x$  \n$= e^{x}(x^2 - 2x) - a x^2 + 4a x$.\nTeacher：Your correction is still inaccurate. Specifically, the term $2a x^2$ was omitted in your final expression. Revisit the combination of all terms involving $a$.\nStudent：You are right, I missed $2a x^2$. The corrected numerator is:  \n$e^{x}(x^2 - 2x) + a(-x^2 + 2x^2 + 2x) = e^{x}(x^2 - 2x) + a(x^2 + 2x)$.\nTeacher：Your corrected expression for the numerator is now accurate. What can you say about the critical points of $g(x)$ based on this derivative?\nStudent：To find the critical points, set $g'(x) = 0$, so $e^{x}(x^2 - 2x) + a(x^2 + 2x) = 0$ and solve for $x$ when $x > 0$.\nTeacher：Your setup for finding critical points is correct. However, can you explain how you plan to analyze the behavior of $g(x)$ to prove it has a minimum value?\nStudent：I was planning to check the sign of $g'(x)$ to determine intervals of increase and decrease, and then examine limits as $x \\to 0^+$ and $x \\to +\\infty$ to see if a minimum exists.\nTeacher：How do you propose to analyze the critical point equation $ e^{x}(x^2 - 2x) + a(x^2 + 2x) = 0 $?\nStudent：I was thinking of rewriting it as $e^{x}(x^2-2x) = -a(x^2+2x)$ and then try to solve for $x$ for a given $a$, but I wasn't sure how to proceed further.\nTeacher：How does the sign of the right-hand side, $-a(x^2 + 2x)$, behave for $x > 0$ and $a \\in [0,1)$?\nStudent：For $x > 0$ and $a \\in [0,1)$, $x^2 + 2x > 0$, so $-a(x^2 + 2x) \\leq 0$ (since $a \\geq 0$).\nTeacher：What is the sign of the left-hand side $e^{x}(x^2 - 2x)$ for $x > 0$?\nStudent：For $x > 0$, $e^{x} > 0$. So the sign of the left-hand side depends on $x^2 - 2x$. It's negative for $0 < x < 2$ and positive for $x > 2$.\nTeacher：Your analysis of the sign of $e^x(x^2 - 2x)$ is correct. How does this compare to the sign of the right-hand side $-a(x^2 + 2x)$ for $x > 0$ and $a \\in [0,1)$?\nStudent：Both are non-positive for $0 < x < 2$ (since $x^2-2x < 0$, $-a(x^2+2x) < 0$), and for $x>2$, $e^{x}(x^2-2x)>0$ while $-a(x^2+2x)<0$. Thus, their signs differ for $x>2$.\nTeacher：For $0 < x < 2$, both sides are non-positive, but how can we conclude the existence of a critical point in this interval?\nStudent：If both sides are negative in $0 < x < 2$, the equation $e^{x}(x^2 - 2x) = -a(x^2 + 2x)$ may only have a solution if the magnitudes match for some $x$ in $(0,2)$. I would look for such a value numerically or by considering function continuity.\nTeacher：Your reasoning suggests a possible critical point in $0 < x < 2$, but how do you ensure such a solution exists for all $a \\in [0,1)$?\nStudent：I cannot guarantee purely from my calculation that a solution always exists for all $a \\in [0,1)$; I would need to analyze further or check the function's behavior at the endpoints to be sure.\nTeacher：How does the behavior of $g(x)$ as $x \\to 0^+$ and $x \\to +\\infty$ help in determining the existence of a minimum?\nStudent：As $x \\to 0^+$, $g(x) \\to -\\infty$ since the denominator approaches $0^+$ and the numerator approaches $-a$. As $x \\to +\\infty$, $g(x) \\to +\\infty$ due to the $e^{x}$ term dominating the numerator. Thus, $g(x)$ decreases to a minimum and then increases.\nTeacher：Your conclusion about the limits is incorrect. Specifically, $g(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to 0^+$ is not necessarily valid. Reevaluate the limit of the numerator and denominator separately as $x \\to 0^+$.\nStudent：As $x \\to 0^+$, the numerator is $e^0 - a \\cdot 0 - a = 1 - a$, and the denominator is $x^2 \\to 0^+$. So $g(x) \\to +\\infty$ if $a < 1$.\nTeacher：Your correction is correct. However, your earlier conclusion that $g(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to 0^+$ was incorrect. What does this imply about the behavior of $g(x)$ near $x = 0^+$ for $a \\in [0,1)$?\nStudent：It implies that $g(x) \\to +\\infty$ as $x \\to 0^+$ for $a \\in [0,1)$, so there's no minimum at $x = 0^+$.\nTeacher：Your corrected understanding of the limit as $ x \\to 0^+ $ is accurate. How does this affect your analysis of whether $ g(x) $ has a minimum on $ x > 0 $?\nStudent：Since $g(x)$ approaches $+\\infty$ as $x \\to 0^+$ and also grows rapidly as $x \\to +\\infty$, there should exist a minimum value at some $x > 0$.\nTeacher：What justifies the conclusion that a minimum must exist between these limits?\nStudent：Because $g(x)$ is continuous on $(0, \\infty)$, and tends to $+\\infty$ as $x \\to 0^+$ and as $x \\to +\\infty$, so by the Extreme Value Theorem, it attains a minimum in $(0, \\infty)$.\nTeacher：Your application of the Extreme Value Theorem is incorrect. The theorem applies to closed and bounded intervals, not to open or unbounded intervals like $ (0, \\infty) $. Justify your conclusion using a different method.\nStudent：Since $g(x)$ is continuous for $x > 0$, and both limits at $x \\to 0^+$ and $x \\to +\\infty$ are $+\\infty$, the graph must achieve a minimum at some $x_0 > 0$ due to its smooth, upward-opening nature.\nTeacher：Your reasoning is based on an assumption about the graph's shape rather than a rigorous justification. Specifically, how do you know there isn't a possibility of oscillation or other behavior preventing a minimum?\nStudent：Since $g(x)$ is differentiable and its limits at both $x\\to 0^+$ and $x\\to+\\infty$ are $+\\infty$, and it is continuous for all $x>0$, a minimum exists at some finite $x>0$ where $g'(x)=0$.\nTeacher：Your assertion that a minimum must exist at some finite $ x > 0 $ where $ g'(x) = 0 $ is unjustified. You have not shown that $ g'(x) = 0 $ has at least one solution in $ (0, \\infty) $. What guarantees the existence of such a critical point?",
