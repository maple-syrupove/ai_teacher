    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$2\\lambda + 5 \\times 4 = 0$, so $\\lambda = -10$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning is based on the dot product being zero, which indicates perpendicular vectors, not parallel ones. How do you express that two vectors are parallel?\nStudent：If two vectors are parallel, their components should be proportional, so the ratios of corresponding components should be equal.\nTeacher：Excellent. Then, how did you use this proportionality in your calculation?\nStudent：I didn't use the proportionality in my calculation earlier. I used the dot product instead.\nTeacher：Correct. So, if vectors are parallel, their components must be proportional. Then, what equation should you set up using the components of $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$?\nStudent：I should set up the equation $\\frac{2}{\\lambda} = \\frac{5}{4}$ to express proportionality.\nTeacher：Good. Then why did you set up an equation involving the dot product earlier?\nStudent：I thought that parallel vectors had a dot product of zero, so I set up the dot product equation by mistake.\nTeacher：Ah, there is your mistake: the dot product of parallel vectors is not zero; that applies to perpendicular vectors. You incorrectly applied a condition for perpendicularity to a problem about parallel vectors. Now, proceed to solve the problem correctly using proportionality.\nStudent：Using the proportionality, $\\frac{2}{\\lambda} = \\frac{5}{4}$. Solving, $2 \\times 4 = 5 \\lambda$, so $\\lambda = \\frac{8}{5}$.\nTeacher：Well done on identifying and correcting your mistake. The correct value is indeed $\\lambda = \\frac{8}{5}$. Is there anything else you would like to clarify?\nStudent：No, thank you. I understand my error now.\nTeacher：You're welcome. I'm glad you understood the distinction between parallel and perpendicular vectors. Feel free to reach out if you need further assistance. Have a great day!\nStudent：$2\\lambda + 5 \\times 4 = 0$, so $\\lambda = -10$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is in assuming the dot product of parallel vectors is zero, which is true only for perpendicular vectors. What condition must hold for two vectors to be parallel?\nStudent：The components of two parallel vectors must be proportional; their corresponding ratios should be equal.\nTeacher：Excellent. So, how does this condition apply to the vectors $\\vec{a} = (2,5)$ and $\\vec{b} = (\\lambda, 4)$? What equation should you form?\nStudent：I should set $\\frac{2}{\\lambda} = \\frac{5}{4}$ to express that their components are proportional.\nTeacher：Exactly. So why did you use the dot product equation $2\\lambda + 5 \\times 4 = 0$ initially?\nStudent：I thought that for parallel vectors the dot product should be zero, so I set it up that way.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that the dot product of perpendicular vectors is zero, but incorrectly applied this to parallel vectors. What should the dot product of parallel vectors be?\nStudent：The dot product of parallel vectors is generally not zero, unless one of them is the zero vector.\nTeacher：Correct. Now, apply the proportionality condition to find the correct value of $\\lambda$.\nStudent：$\\frac{2}{\\lambda} = \\frac{5}{4}$, so $2 \\times 4 = 5\\lambda$, giving $\\lambda = \\frac{8}{5}$.\nTeacher：Well done. You have now correctly applied the proportionality condition for parallel vectors and found $\\lambda = \\frac{8}{5}$. Is there anything else you would like to discuss?\nStudent：No, that's all. Thank you for your help!\nTeacher：You're welcome! If you have more questions, feel free to ask. Have a great day!\nStudent：$2\\lambda + 5 \\times 4 = 0$, so $\\lambda = -10$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning is based on the dot product being zero, which indicates perpendicular vectors, not parallel ones. How do you express that two vectors are parallel?\nStudent：If two vectors are parallel, their corresponding components should be proportional, so their ratios are equal.\nTeacher：Excellent. Then, how does this apply to $\\vec{a} = (2,5)$ and $\\vec{b} = (\\lambda, 4)$? What equation should you form?\nStudent：I should set $\\frac{2}{\\lambda} = \\frac{5}{4}$ to represent proportional components.\nTeacher：Exactly. Then why did you use the dot product equation $2\\lambda + 5 \\times 4 = 0$ earlier?\nStudent：I mistakenly thought that for parallel vectors, their dot product should be zero, so I used that condition.\nTeacher：Correct. The dot product being zero is a condition for perpendicular vectors, not parallel ones. You misapplied this condition to the problem. What should you do next?\nStudent：I should solve the equation using the proportionality: $\\frac{2}{\\lambda} = \\frac{5}{4}$, then find $\\lambda$.\nTeacher：Good. Then solve the proportion correctly and state your result.\nStudent：$2 \\times 4 = 5\\lambda$, so $\\lambda = \\frac{8}{5}$.\nTeacher：Well done on solving the proportion correctly. Your final answer of $\\lambda = \\frac{8}{5}$ is accurate. Is there anything else you wish to discuss?",
