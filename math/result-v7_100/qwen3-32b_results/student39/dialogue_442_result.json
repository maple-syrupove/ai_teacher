    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：0\nTeacher：Can you explain how you arrived at this answer?\nStudent：I tried to expand the expression and wrote out some terms, but I didn't see $x^2y^7$ appear, so I wrote 0.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you expanded the expression?\nStudent：I distributed $(x-y)$ into $(x+y)^8$, then tried multiplying out terms from the expansion of $(x+y)^8$ with $x$ and $-y$, but only listed some terms.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined which terms to list?\nStudent：I just started with $x$ times some terms from $(x+y)^8$ and $-y$ times some other terms, picking a few combinations I thought might work, but didn't follow a systematic method.\nTeacher：What method did you use to identify terms contributing to $x^2 y^7$?\nStudent：I tried guessing which terms might make $x^2y^7$, but I didn't use any specific method to find them.\nTeacher：What is the general term in the expansion of $(x+y)^8$?\nStudent：The general term is $\\binom{8}{k}x^k y^{8-k}$.\nTeacher：Good. Then, what terms from $(x+y)^8$ contribute to $x^2 y^7$ when multiplied by $x$ or $-y$?\nStudent：If I multiply $x$ by the term with $x^1y^7$, I get $x^2y^7$. For $-y$, I need the term with $x^2y^6$ to get $x^2y^7$.\nTeacher：What are the coefficients of those terms in $(x+y)^8$?\nStudent：The coefficient of $x^1y^7$ is $\\binom{8}{1} = 8$, and the coefficient of $x^2y^6$ is $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$.\nTeacher：What is the coefficient of $x^2 y^7$ after combining contributions from both parts?\nStudent：The coefficient is $1 \\times 8 - 1 \\times 28 = 8 - 28 = -20$.\nTeacher：Your calculation assumes the sign of the contributions correctly, but can you confirm the exact terms being multiplied by $x$ and $-y$?\nStudent：When multiplying $x$ by $x^1y^7$ in $(x+y)^8$, I get $x^2y^7$. When multiplying $-y$ by $x^2y^6$, I get $-x^2y^7$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the terms and their contributions. What is the final step in determining the coefficient?\nStudent：I add $8$ from the $x$ part and $-28$ from the $-y$ part: $8 - 28 = -20$.\nTeacher：Your calculation is now clearly stated. The mistake in your initial answer of 0 was due to not systematically identifying and combining the contributing terms.\nStudent：zzc",
