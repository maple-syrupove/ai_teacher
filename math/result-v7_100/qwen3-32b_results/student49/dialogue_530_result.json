    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined $ A \\cap B = \\emptyset $?\nStudent：I thought that the intervals for $A$ and $B$ did not overlap, so their intersection is empty.\nTeacher：How did you determine the interval for set $ A $?\nStudent：I solved $x^2 - 2x > 0$, so $x(x-2) > 0$, which gives $x < 0$ or $x > 2$. So $A = (-\\infty,0)\\cup(2,\\infty)$.\nTeacher：Teacher：Then how did you determine whether these intervals overlap with set $ B $?\nStudent：I compared $A = (-\\infty,0)\\cup(2,\\infty)$ and $B=(-\\sqrt{5},\\sqrt{5})$, and I thought there was no intersection.\nTeacher：What is the intersection of $ (-\\infty, 0) $ with $ (-\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{5}) $?\nStudent：The intersection is $(-\\sqrt{5},0)$.\nTeacher：So why did you conclude there is no intersection between $ A $ and $ B $?\nStudent：I think I made a mistake by not realizing that $(-\\sqrt{5},0)$ is actually a non-empty intersection, so my previous answer was incorrect.\nTeacher：Your realization is correct. The mistake was concluding that $ A \\cap B = \\emptyset $ without properly evaluating the intersection of the intervals. Specifically, you overlooked that $ (-\\infty, 0) \\cap (-\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{5}) = (-\\sqrt{5}, 0) $, which is non-empty.\nStudent：zzc",
