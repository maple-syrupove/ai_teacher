    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：The sphere's diameter is 3, so its radius is 1.5. The surface area is 9π.\nTeacher：What is the relationship between the cuboid and the sphere in terms of geometry?\nStudent：All eight vertices of the cuboid touch the sphere’s surface.\nTeacher：What is the geometric term for a sphere that contains all vertices of a cuboid?\nStudent：That sphere is called the circumscribed sphere of the cuboid.\nTeacher：What is the relationship between the cuboid’s dimensions and the diameter of its circumscribed sphere?\nStudent：The diameter should be related to the space diagonal of the cuboid.\nTeacher：Correct. What is the formula for the space diagonal of a cuboid?\nStudent：The formula for the space diagonal is $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$, where $l$, $w$, and $h$ are the length, width, and height.\nTeacher：What value did you use for the space diagonal in your calculation?\nStudent：I used the length of the cuboid, which is 3.\nTeacher：That is incorrect. The space diagonal must account for all three dimensions. What value did you actually calculate for the space diagonal?\nStudent：I used only the value 3 and did not calculate the space diagonal using all three dimensions.\nTeacher：Correct. You used only the length of the cuboid instead of calculating the space diagonal using $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$. This is the source of your error.\nStudent：zzc",
