    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $\\frac{1}{2}$\nTeacher：Can you explain your reasoning for choosing C?\nStudent：I used the identity $\\cos^2 A = 1 - \\sin^2 A$, then plugged in the value related to $\\sin 2\\alpha$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning involves an incorrect identity. You used $\\cos^2 A = 1 - \\sin^2 A$, but this does not apply to the squared cosine of a sum, like $\\cos^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$. What approach did you take next?\nStudent：I substituted the value of $\\sin 2\\alpha$ into what I thought was $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ to get the answer.\nTeacher：Why did you substitute $\\sin 2\\alpha$ into $\\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$? How are these two expressions related?\nStudent：I thought they might be equivalent because both involve trigonometric functions of $\\alpha$, but now I'm not sure how they are related.\nTeacher：Your assumption that $\\sin 2\\alpha$ is equivalent to $\\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ is incorrect. These expressions are not directly related through simple equivalence. What identity or formula did you use for $\\cos^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$?\nStudent：I used $\\cos^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}) = 1 - \\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$.\nTeacher：You correctly applied the identity $\\cos^2 A = 1 - \\sin^2 A$, but you failed to compute or relate $\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ properly. How did you determine the value of $\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$?\nStudent：I didn't actually compute $\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$; I just used the given $\\sin 2\\alpha$ value instead.\nTeacher：You incorrectly substituted $\\sin 2\\alpha$ for $\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$, assuming they are the same, which is false. These expressions represent different trigonometric relationships and cannot be equated directly. What made you think they could be used interchangeably?\nStudent：Since both had sine functions with $\\alpha$, I thought they might represent the same value, but I see now that's not correct.\nTeacher：You recognized the mistake in equating $\\sin 2\\alpha$ with $\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$, which was incorrect. However, your core error was misapplying the identity $\\cos^2 A = 1 - \\sin^2 A$ without properly computing or relating $\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$.\nStudent：zzc",
