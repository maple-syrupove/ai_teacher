    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A. The minimum and maximum are $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined the minimum and maximum values of the function?\nStudent：I treated $f(x)$ as $A\\sin x + B\\cos x + C$ with $A=1$, $B=1$, $C=0$, and used the max/min formula: max is $\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}$, min is $-\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}$.\nTeacher：Your approach assumes a specific form for $ f(x) $, but does $ f(x) = \\cos x + (x+1)\\sin x + 1 $ fit the pattern $ A\\sin x + B\\cos x + C $? Why or why not?\nStudent：No, actually, $(x+1)\\sin x$ has a variable coefficient, so it's not strictly $A\\sin x+B\\cos x+C$ where $A$ and $B$ are constants.\nTeacher：Then why did you apply a formula meant for constant coefficients to a function with a variable coefficient?\nStudent：I thought the formula might still give an approximate answer since I saw $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$ together, and I didn't consider the effect of the $x+1$ coefficient.\nTeacher：You treated the variable coefficient $x+1$ as if it were constant, which is incorrect. This invalidates the use of the formula for max/min of a linear combination of sine and cosine.\nStudent：zzc",
