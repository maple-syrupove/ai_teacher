    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $2-\\mathrm{i}$\nTeacher：Can you explain how you arrived at this answer?\nStudent：I divided 5i by 1 and then 5i by -2i separately, then combined the results to get 2 - i.\nTeacher：What rule allows you to divide complex numbers term by term like this?\nStudent：I thought I could just divide the parts directly since that's how I usually handle real numbers in fractions.\nTeacher：Does this method of term-by-term division apply to complex numbers in the same way it does to real numbers?\nStudent：I assumed it would work the same way, so I used it, but I'm not sure if that's correct for complex numbers.\nTeacher：Teacher：What is the standard method for dividing complex numbers?\nStudent：The standard method is to multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator and simplify.\nTeacher：Then why didn't you use this method to solve the problem?\nStudent：I was trying to find a faster way and thought dividing the parts directly would give the answer.\nTeacher：Your assumption that term-by-term division applies to complex numbers is incorrect.
