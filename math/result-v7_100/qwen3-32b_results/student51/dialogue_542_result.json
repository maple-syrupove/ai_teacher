    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I expanded (1 + a x) to get (1 + a x), then expanded (1 + x)^5, and looked for the x^2 term directly. I got that a = 0.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you combined the terms to find the coefficient of $ x^2 $?\nStudent：I looked for the x^2 term from (1 + a x) and (1 + x)^5, so I tried to match x^2 terms directly.\nTeacher：What is the coefficient of $ x^2 $ in the expansion of $ (1 + ax)(1 + x)^5 $?\nStudent：The coefficient I found was just from matching a x^2 term, so I said it was the same as the coefficient of x^2 in (1 + x)^5, which is 10.\nTeacher：What happens to the term when you multiply $ ax $ from the first bracket with the $ x $ term from $ (1 + x)^5 $?\nStudent：When I multiply $a x$ by the $x$ term in $(1 + x)^5$, I get $a x \\cdot 5 x = 5a x^2$.\nTeacher：So, according to your calculation, the coefficient of $ x^2 $ is 10 (from $ (1 + x)^5 $) plus 5a. Why did you conclude that $ a = 0 $?\nStudent：Because the problem says the coefficient of $x^2$ is 5, so I set $10 + 5a = 5$ and solved for $a = 0$.\nTeacher：Then why did you initially state that $ a = 0 $?\nStudent：Because based on my approach, I matched the $x^2$ terms directly and didn't consider other combinations, so I got $a = 0$.\nTeacher：Your mistake was not considering all combinations that contribute to the $ x^2 $ term in the product.\nStudent：zzc",
