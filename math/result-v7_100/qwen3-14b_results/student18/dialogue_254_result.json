    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose C.\nTeacher：What is the domain of $ f(x) $?\nStudent：The domain of $f(x)$ is all $x$ such that $\\sin x \\neq 0$, so $x \\neq k\\pi$ where $k$ is any integer.\nTeacher：What is the definition of symmetry with respect to the line $ x = \\pi $?\nStudent：A function is symmetric with respect to the line $x=\\pi$ if $f(\\pi + t) = f(\\pi - t)$ for all $t$ in the domain.\nTeacher：Let’s test this definition with $ t = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $. What is $ f(\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) $?\nStudent：$f\\left(\\pi+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\pi+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\pi+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} = \\sin\\frac{3\\pi}{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\frac{3\\pi}{2}} = -1 + \\left(-1\\right) = -2$.\nTeacher：What is $ f(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) $?\nStudent：$f\\left(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} = \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{2}} = 1 + 1 = 2$\nTeacher：The values $ f(\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -2 $ and $ f(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 2 $ are not equal. What does this imply about the symmetry?\nStudent：This implies the function is not symmetric with respect to the line $x=\\pi$.\nTeacher：Your initial choice of C was incorrect. You did not consider the correct symmetry properties of the function. What do you think is the correct answer now?\nStudent：I think the correct answer might be D.\nTeacher：What is the definition of symmetry with respect to the line $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $?\nStudent：A function is symmetric with respect to $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ if $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right)$ for all $t$ in the domain.\nTeacher：Let’s test this definition with $ t = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $. What is $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $?\nStudent：$f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = f(\\pi)$. But $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$, so $f(\\pi)$ is undefined.\nTeacher：You tested $ t = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $, but this leads to an undefined value. Does this mean the function is not symmetric about $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $?\nStudent：No, it just means that for $t = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $f(\\pi)$ is undefined. We should test other $t$ within the domain.\nTeacher：Let’s try $ t = \\frac{\\pi}{4} $. What is $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) $?\nStudent：$f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\sqrt{2}$\nTeacher：What is $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) $?\nStudent：$f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\sqrt{2}$\nTeacher：The values $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) $ and $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) $ are equal. What does this suggest about the symmetry?\nStudent：This suggests that the function is symmetric with respect to the line $x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：Your conclusion suggests symmetry about $ x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $. However, you only tested one value of $ t $. What happens if you test another $ t $, such as $ t = \\frac{\\pi}{6} $?\nStudent：$f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$. \n\n$f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nTeacher：The values are equal for $ t = \\frac{\\pi}{6} $. What does this imply about the symmetry of the function?\nStudent：It implies that the function $f(x)$ does appear to be symmetric with respect to the line $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：Your tests show symmetry for specific values of $ t $, but you have not proven it for all $ t $. What is the general relationship between $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right) $ and $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) $?\nStudent：The general relationship is: \n$f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right)}$ and $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right)}$.\nTeacher：What is $ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right) $ and $ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) $?\nStudent：$\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right) = \\cos t$, and $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) = \\sin t$.\nTeacher：Your statement about $ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) = \\sin t $ is incorrect. What is the correct identity for $ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) $?\nStudent：The correct identity is $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) = \\cos t$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the identity as $ \\cos t $. What is $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right) $ and $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) $ now?\nStudent：Both are $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + t\\right) = \\cos t + \\frac{1}{\\cos t}$ and $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - t\\right) = \\cos t + \\frac{1}{\\cos t}$. The expressions are the same.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified both expressions to $ \\cos t + \\frac{1}{\\cos t} $. What does this imply about the symmetry of $ f(x) $?\nStudent：It implies that $f(x)$ is symmetric with respect to the line $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ for all $t$ in the domain.\nTeacher：Your conclusion is correct. What was your initial mistake when you selected option C?",
