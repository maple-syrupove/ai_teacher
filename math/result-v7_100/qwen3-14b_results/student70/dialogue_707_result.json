    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $4 \\notin M$\nTeacher：If $C_U M = \\{1,3\\}$, what does that tell you about the elements of $M$?\nStudent：It means that $M$ contains all elements in $U$ except $1$ and $3$.\nTeacher：If $M$ contains all elements in $U$ except $1$ and $3$, then which elements are in $M$?\nStudent：The elements in $M$ are $2$, $4$, and $5$.\nTeacher：So, if $M = \\{2, 4, 5\\}$, which of the options is true?\nStudent：A. $2 \\in M$\nTeacher：You previously said $M = \\{2, 4, 5\\}$. Why did you choose option A now?\nStudent：Because $2$ is in $M$, so option A is true.\nTeacher：You previously said $M = \\{2, 4, 5\\}$. Why did you choose option A now?\nStudent：I realized that option A correctly states that $2 \\in M$, matching the set I found earlier.\nTeacher：You previously said $M = \\{2, 4, 5\\}$. Why did you initially choose option C?\nStudent：I wasn't sure about the set operation and guessed based on intuition at first.\nTeacher：Your initial choice of option C was incorrect because $4 \\in M$, not $4 \\notin M$. Why did you think $4$ was not in $M$?\nStudent：Because I didn't fully understand the notation at first and chose based on a guess, rather than analyzing the symbol or reconstructing the set.\nTeacher：You initially misunderstood the complement notation, leading you to incorrectly assume $4 \\notin M$. The correct set $M$ is $\\{2, 4, 5\\}$. Please confirm with \"zzc.\"\nStudent：zzc",
