    "correct_answer": "Solution: (1) We are given an arithmetic sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ with the first term $a_1 = -7$.\nWe are also given that the sum of the first 3 terms is $S_3 = -15$.\nThe formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$, where $d$ is the common difference.\nFor $n=3$, we have:\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + (3-1)d) = -15$\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + 2d) = 3(a_1+d) = -15$.\nDivide by 3: $a_1 + d = -5$.\nSubstitute the given value $a_1 = -7$:\n$-7 + d = -5$\n$d = 2$.\n\nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting $a_1=-7$ and $d=2$:\n$a_n = -7 + (n-1)2 = -7 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 9$.\n\n(2) To find the formula for $S_n$, we use the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$.\n$S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(-7 + (2n-9)) = \\frac{n}{2}(2n - 16) = n(n-8) = n^2 - 8n$.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $S_n$, we can treat $S_n = n^2 - 8n$ as a quadratic function of $n$. This is an upward-opening parabola. Its minimum value occurs at the vertex.\nThe vertex of a parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is at $x = -b/(2a)$.\nFor our function, the vertex is at $n = -(-8)/(2\\cdot1) = 4$.\nSince $n=4$ is a positive integer, the minimum value of the sequence $S_n$ occurs at $n=4$.\nLet's find the value of $S_4$:\n$S_4 = 4^2 - 8(4) = 16 - 32 = -16$.\nAlternatively, we can complete the square for $S_n$: \n$S_n = n^2 - 8n = (n^2 - 8n + 16) - 16 = (n-4)^2 - 16$.\nThe minimum value of this expression is -16, which occurs when $n=4$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $S_n$ is -16.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$a_n = -7 - 4(n-1) = -4n - 3$\nTeacher：What is the common difference of the arithmetic sequence?\nStudent：The common difference is $d = -4$.\nTeacher：How did you calculate the common difference?\nStudent：I used $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$, so $-15 + 7 = 2d$, giving $d = -4$.\nTeacher：Your calculation for the common difference is incorrect. How did you arrive at the equation $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$?\nStudent：I remembered a formula involving sums and tried applying it: $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$.\nTeacher：What is the correct formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence?\nStudent：The correct formula is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)$.\nTeacher：You used an incorrect formula to find the common difference. What is the relationship between $S_3$ and the first three terms of the sequence?\nStudent：$S_3$ is equal to $a_1 + a_2 + a_3$.\nTeacher：Yes, $S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3$. How did you use this to find the common difference?\nStudent：I actually didn’t use this relationship. I used a different formula, not $S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3$.\nTeacher：You did not correctly use the relationship between $S_3$ and the terms of the sequence to find the common difference. What is the formula for $S_3$ in terms of $a_1$ and $d$?\nStudent：$S_3 = a_1 + (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 2d) = 3a_1 + 3d$\nTeacher：You correctly expanded $S_3$, but how did you use this to find the common difference?\nStudent：I didn't use this formula in my calculation. I used $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$ instead.\nTeacher：You used an incorrect formula $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$ to find the common difference. What is the correct way to relate $S_3$ and $d$?\nStudent：The correct way is to set $S_3 = 3a_1 + 3d$, then solve for $d$ using the given values.\nTeacher：You are correct that $S_3 = 3a_1 + 3d$. How did you use this to find the value of $d$?\nStudent：I did not use $S_3 = 3a_1 + 3d$ in my original calculation; I used the incorrect formula instead.\nTeacher：You incorrectly used the formula $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$ to find $d$. What is the correct equation using $S_3 = 3a_1 + 3d$ and the given value of $S_3$?\nStudent：The correct equation is $-15 = 3(-7) + 3d$.\nTeacher：You correctly substituted $S_3 = -15$ and $a_1 = -7$ into the equation $S_3 = 3a_1 + 3d$. What is the value of $d$ when you solve this equation?\nStudent：To solve $-15 = 3(-7) + 3d$, we get $-15 = -21 + 3d$, so $3d = 6$, which gives $d = 2$.\nTeacher：Your calculation for $d$ is incorrect. What is the result of $-15 + 21$?\nStudent：$-15 + 21 = 6$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $-15 + 21 = 6$, but then divided by 3 incorrectly. What is $6 \\div 3$?\nStudent：$6 \\div 3 = 2$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $6 \\div 3 = 2$, but this contradicts your earlier incorrect statement that $d = -4$. What was the error in your initial calculation of $d$?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You initially claimed $d = -4$, but the correct value is $d = 2$. What led you to believe $d = -4$?\nStudent：I thought the formula $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$ applied, and used it to find $d = -4$.\nTeacher：Your initial error was using the incorrect formula $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$ to calculate the common difference $d$. This formula does not exist in the context of arithmetic sequences. What is the correct formula for $S_3$?\nStudent：The correct formula for $S_3$ is $S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3$.\nTeacher：You are correct that $S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3$. What is the expression for $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of $a_1$ and $d$?\nStudent：$a_2 = a_1 + d$, $a_3 = a_1 + 2d$\nTeacher：You correctly expressed $a_2$ and $a_3$. What is the expression for $S_3$ in terms of $a_1$ and $d$ using these expressions?\nStudent：$S_3 = a_1 + (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 2d) = 3a_1 + 3d$\nTeacher：You correctly derived $S_3 = 3a_1 + 3d$. What is the value of $d$ when you substitute $S_3 = -15$ and $a_1 = -7$ into this equation?",
