Why did you think the answer choices did not include $\\frac{2}{3}$?\nStudent：I thought maybe I made a mistake with the method or how I interpreted the intervals.\nTeacher：Your calculation is correct, and answer choice B is indeed $\\frac{2}{3}$. Why did you believe the answer choices didn't include it?\nStudent：I thought I might have misunderstood how to compare the intervals or how to set up the probability.\nTeacher：Your calculation is correct, and answer choice B is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Why did you think the answer choices didn't include it?\nStudent：I thought maybe I used the wrong type of probability method or misread the format of the choices.\nTeacher：Your calculation is correct, and answer choice B is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Why did you think the answer choices didn't include it?\nStudent：I thought maybe I should have used a different approach, like counting or matching to the format of the options.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated the probability as $\\frac{2}{3}$, which is answer choice B. Why did you think the answer choices didn't include it?\nStudent：I thought I misunderstood the problem type or needed to use a count-based approach instead of fractions.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated the probability as $\\frac{2}{3}$, which is answer choice B. Why did you think the answer choices didn't include it?\nStudent：I thought I might have needed to count possibilities or use a discrete approach instead of fractions.\nTeacher：Your calculation is correct, and answer choice B is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Why did you think the answer choices didn't include it?\nStudent：I thought the problem maybe required counting actual numbers or using discrete probability, so I hesitated.\nTeacher：You correctly applied continuous probability by comparing interval lengths. Why did you consider a discrete approach instead?\nStudent：Because I initially thought probability should be calculated as the number of outcomes over the total, like in discrete cases.\nTeacher：You correctly applied continuous probability by comparing interval lengths. Why did you consider a discrete approach instead?\nStudent：I was used to solving problems by counting outcomes, so I applied that thinking here, treating intervals like countable options.\nTeacher：You mistakenly applied discrete probability methods to a continuous interval problem.
