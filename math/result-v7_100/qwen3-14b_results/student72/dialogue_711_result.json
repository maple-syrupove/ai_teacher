    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is 2.\nTeacher：What is the focus $F$ of the parabola $y^2 = 4x$?\nStudent：The focus $F$ is at $(1, 0)$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the focus $F$ as $(1, 0)$. What is the distance formula between two points?\nStudent：The distance formula between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly recalled the distance formula. What is the distance $|AF|$ if point $A$ is $(x, y)$ on the parabola?\nStudent：The distance $|AF|$ is $\\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly expressed $|AF|$. What is the distance $|BF|$ where $B = (3, 0)$?\nStudent：The distance $|BF|$ is $\\sqrt{(3-1)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $|BF| = 2$. What is the distance $|AF|$ in terms of the coordinates of point $A$ on the parabola?\nStudent：The distance $|AF| = \\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2}$, where $A=(x, y)$ and $y^2=4x$.\nTeacher：You correctly expressed $|AF|$, but how did you use the condition $|AF| = |BF|$ to find point $A$?\nStudent：I set $|AF| = 2$, so $\\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2} = 2$, and since $y^2 = 4x$, I substituted to get $\\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + 4x} = 2$. Then I solved for $x$.\nTeacher：You correctly substituted $y^2 = 4x$ into the equation. What is $(x - 1)^2 + 4x$ simplified?\nStudent：$(x-1)^2 + 4x = x^2 - 2x + 1 + 4x = x^2 + 2x + 1$\nTeacher：You correctly simplified $(x - 1)^2 + 4x$ to $x^2 + 2x + 1$. What is the next step in solving $\\sqrt{x^2 + 2x + 1} = 2$?\nStudent：The next step is to square both sides to get $x^2 + 2x + 1 = 4$. Then solve for $x$.\nTeacher：You correctly squared both sides. What are the solutions to $x^2 + 2x + 1 = 4$?\nStudent：The solutions are $x^2 + 2x + 1 = 4 \\implies x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0 \\implies (x+3)(x-1)=0$ so $x=1$ or $x=-3$.\nTeacher：You correctly solved the quadratic equation. However, since point $A$ lies on the parabola $y^2 = 4x$, what values of $x$ are valid?\nStudent：Since $y^2 = 4x$, $x$ must be greater than or equal to $0$. So, $x=1$ is valid and $x=-3$ is not.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $x = -3$ is invalid. What are the coordinates of point $A$ when $x = 1$?\nStudent：When $x = 1$, from $y^2 = 4x$, we get $y^2 = 4$ so $y = 2$ or $y = -2$. So $A$ is $(1, 2)$ or $(1, -2)$.\nTeacher：You correctly found the coordinates of point $A$. What is the distance $|AB|$ between $A = (1, 2)$ and $B = (3, 0)$?\nStudent：The distance $|AB| = \\sqrt{(1-3)^2 + (2-0)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 4} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $|AB| = 2\\sqrt{2}$. Your answer matches option B. Please confirm with \"zzc.\"\nStudent：zzc",
