    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried $x=2, y=0$ and got $z=2-0=2$, so the minimum value is 2.\nTeacher：Your test point (2, 0) does not satisfy all constraints. Which constraint is violated?\nStudent：Let me check: For $x=2, y=0$, the first constraint is $4*2 - 3*0 - 3 = 8-3=5\\geq 0$, so it's satisfied. The second constraint is $2-2*0-2=0\\leq 0$, satisfied. The third: $2*2+6*0-9=4-9=-5\\leq0$, satisfied.\n\nSo, none of the constraints are violated at $(2,0)$.\nTeacher：Your calculation shows (2, 0) satisfies all constraints. Why do you think it is not valid?\nStudent：I thought any point meeting all constraints could be the minimum, so I just picked (2,0) and calculated $z$.\nTeacher：Your assumption that any point in the feasible region gives the minimum is incorrect. How did you determine (2, 0) would yield the minimum value?\nStudent：I chose (2, 0) because it looked simple, and I just wanted to try it to see what value I would get for $z$.\nTeacher：You assumed that testing a single point would give the minimum value, but you didn't check the boundaries of the feasible region. What method should be used to find the minimum value of $z = x - 5y$?\nStudent：I think I should try different points on the boundaries or maybe substitute more values to check for a minimum.\nTeacher：You need to systematically analyze the feasible region's vertices. Why did you not consider solving for intersection points of the constraints?\nStudent：I didn't think of finding intersection points because I was just focused on plugging in easy values, not on the shape or corners of the region.\nTeacher：You overlooked that the minimum value of a linear function over a convex polygon occurs at one of the vertices. What are the vertices of the feasible region defined by the constraints?\nStudent：I haven't calculated the intersection points yet, so I don't know the vertices of the feasible region.\nTeacher：You need to find the intersection points of the constraint lines to determine the feasible region's vertices. What is the first pair of constraints you should solve simultaneously?\nStudent：Let me try: I'll solve $4x-3y-3=0$ and $x-2y-2=0$ together first.\nTeacher：You have selected two constraints. What is the solution to this system of equations?\nStudent：First, from $x - 2y - 2 = 0$, we get $x = 2y + 2$.\n\nSubstitute into $4x - 3y - 3 = 0$:\n$4(2y+2) - 3y - 3 = 0$\n$8y + 8 - 3y - 3 = 0$\n$5y + 5 = 0$\n$y = -1$\n\nThen $x = 2(-1) + 2 = 0$.\n\nSo, the intersection is $(0, -1)$.\nTeacher：You correctly solved the system, but this point $(0, -1)$ may not lie within the feasible region. Does it satisfy all three constraints?\nStudent：Let me check:\n\nFirst constraint: $4*0 - 3*(-1) - 3 = 0 + 3 - 3 = 0 \\geq 0$ ✔️  \nSecond: $0 - 2*(-1) - 2 = 0 + 2 - 2 = 0 \\leq 0$ ✔️  \nThird: $2*0 + 6*(-1) - 9 = 0 - 6 - 9 = -15 \\leq 0$ ✔️\n\nAll constraints are satisfied.\nTeacher：You have found a vertex $(0, -1)$. What is the value of $z = x - 5y$ at this point?\nStudent：At $(0, -1)$, $z = 0 - 5*(-1) = 0 + 5 = 5$.\nTeacher：You calculated $z = 5$ at $(0, -1)$, but this is not the minimum. What other vertices of the feasible region need to be checked?\nStudent：I haven't found the other intersection points yet. Should I solve for where $x-2y-2=0$ meets $2x+6y-9=0$ next?\nTeacher：Yes, that is a good next step. What is the solution to this system of equations?\nStudent：First, from $x - 2y - 2 = 0$, $x = 2y + 2$.\n\nSubstitute in $2x + 6y - 9 = 0$:\n\n$2(2y+2) + 6y - 9 = 0$  \n\n$4y + 4 + 6y - 9 = 0$  \n\n$10y - 5 = 0$  \n\n$y = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThen $x = 2(\\frac{1}{2}) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3$\n\nSo the intersection point is $(3, \\frac{1}{2})$.\nTeacher：You correctly solved the system, but this point $(3, \\frac{1}{2})$ may not lie within the feasible region. Does it satisfy all three constraints?\nStudent：Let me check:\n\nFirst: $4*3 - 3*(\\frac{1}{2}) - 3 = 12 - 1.5 - 3 = 7.5 \\geq 0$ ✔️  \nSecond: $3 - 2*(\\frac{1}{2}) - 2 = 3 - 1 - 2 = 0 \\leq 0$ ✔️  \nThird: $2*3 + 6*(\\frac{1}{2}) - 9 = 6 + 3 - 9 = 0$ ✔️\n\nAll constraints are satisfied.\nTeacher：You have found another vertex $(3, \\frac{1}{2})$. What is the value of $z = x - 5y$ at this point?\nStudent：At $(3, \\frac{1}{2})$: $z = 3 - 5 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3 - 2.5 = 0.5$.\nTeacher：You have found $z = 0.5$ at $(3, \\frac{1}{2})$. What is the third vertex of the feasible region you need to check?\nStudent：I still need to solve $4x-3y-3=0$ and $2x+6y-9=0$ together to find the third vertex.\nTeacher：You need to solve the system $4x - 3y - 3 = 0$ and $2x + 6y - 9 = 0$. What is your approach?\nStudent：I will solve $2x + 6y - 9 = 0$ for $x$, then substitute into $4x - 3y - 3 = 0$.\n\nFrom $2x + 6y - 9 = 0$, $2x = 9 - 6y$, so $x = \\frac{9-6y}{2}$. \n\nSubstitute $x$ in $4x - 3y - 3 = 0$:\n\n$4\\left(\\frac{9-6y}{2}\\right) - 3y - 3 = 0$.\n\n$2(9-6y) - 3y - 3 = 0$.\n\n$18 - 12y - 3y - 3 = 0$.\n\n$18 - 15y - 3 = 0$.\n\n$15 - 15y = 0$.\n\n$y = 1$.\n\nNow, $x = \\frac{9-6*1}{2} = \\frac{9-6}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nSo, the intersection is $\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 1\\right)$.\nTeacher：You correctly solved the system, but this point $\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 1\\right)$ may not lie within the feasible region. Does it satisfy all three constraints?\nStudent：Let me check:\n\nFirst: $4*\\frac{3}{2} - 3*1 - 3 = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0 \\geq 0$ ✔️  \nSecond: $\\frac{3}{2} - 2*1 - 2 = \\frac{3}{2} - 2 - 2 = \\frac{3}{2} - 4 = -\\frac{5}{2} \\leq 0$ ✔️  \nThird: $2*\\frac{3}{2} + 6*1 - 9 = 3 + 6 - 9 = 0$ ✔️\n\nAll constraints are satisfied.\nTeacher：You have found all three vertices: $(0, -1)$, $(3, \\frac{1}{2})$, and $\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 1\\right)$. What is the value of $z = x - 5y$ at the third vertex?\nStudent：At $\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 1\\right)$: $z = \\frac{3}{2} - 5 \\times 1 = \\frac{3}{2} - 5 = -\\frac{7}{2}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $z = -\\frac{7}{2}$ at $\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 1\\right)$. This is the minimum value among the vertices. What was your initial mistake in assuming the minimum value was 2?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You assumed the minimum value could be found by testing a single arbitrary point, rather than evaluating all vertices of the feasible region. This is your mistake. Please confirm with \"zzc.\"",
