    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：First, I expanded (1 + a x) to get 1 + a x, then expanded (1 + x)^5. The coefficient of x^2 is 5a. So, 5a = 5, giving a = 1.\nTeacher：What is the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(1 + x)^5$?\nStudent：The coefficient of $x^2$ in $(1 + x)^5$ is $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$.\nTeacher：You said the coefficient of $x^2$ is 5a. How did you arrive at this?\nStudent：I thought the coefficient of $x^2$ comes from multiplying $a x$ in $(1 + a x)$ by the $x$ term in $(1 + x)^5$, and that gives $5a$.\nTeacher：You considered only one part of the product. What other term in $(1 + ax)(1 + x)^5$ contributes to the $x^2$ coefficient?\nStudent：I didn't consider any other term. I just looked at multiplying $a x$ by $x$ from $(1 + x)^5$.\nTeacher：You only considered the product of $a x$ and the $x$ term from $(1 + x)^5$. What about the product of $1$ from $(1 + ax)$ and the $x^2$ term from $(1 + x)^5$?\nStudent：Oh, I didn't include that—it looks like I only focused on the $a x$ part with $x$ in the expansion.\nTeacher：You neglected the contribution from multiplying the constant term $1$ in $(1 + ax)$ with the $x^2$ term in $(1 + x)^5$. This is why your calculation was incorrect. What is the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(1 + x)^5$?\nStudent：The coefficient of $x^2$ in $(1 + x)^5$ is 10.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(1 + x)^5$ as 10. How did you combine this with the other term to get the total coefficient of $x^2$?\nStudent：I only combined $a x$ times the $x$ term, which I got as $5a$, and didn't add the $1 \\times 10$ from $x^2$.\nTeacher：You neglected to add the contribution from $1 \\times 10$. What is the total coefficient of $x^2$?\nStudent：The total coefficient should be $10 + 5a$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the total coefficient as $10 + 5a$. Given this equals 5, what equation does this form?\nStudent：The equation is $10 + 5a = 5$.\nTeacher：You correctly formed the equation $10 + 5a = 5$. What is the value of $a$ that satisfies this equation?\nStudent：Solving $10 + 5a = 5$, we get $5a = -5$, hence $a = -1$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of $a = -1$ is correct. However, this contradicts your earlier conclusion that the coefficient of $x^2$ was $5a$. What was the error in your initial reasoning?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You initially only considered the term from $a x \\times x$ and ignored the term from $1 \\times x^2$. What was the coefficient of $x$ in $(1 + x)^5$?\nStudent：The coefficient of $x$ in $(1 + x)^5$ is $\\binom{5}{1} = 5$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the coefficient of $x$ in $(1 + x)^5$ as 5. But how did you use this to determine the contribution to the $x^2$ term?\nStudent：I thought multiplying $a x$ from $(1 + a x)$ by $x$ in $(1 + x)^5$ would give $a \\times 5 = 5a$ as the coefficient for $x^2$.\nTeacher：You assumed that multiplying $a x$ by the $x$ term in $(1 + x)^5$ directly gives $5a$ as the coefficient for $x^2$. What is the actual contribution of this product to the $x^2$ term?\nStudent：The contribution is $a$ times the coefficient of $x$ in $(1 + x)^5$, which is $5a$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the contribution from $a x \\times x$ as $5a$, but you neglected to add the contribution from $1 \\times x^2$, which is 10. What was your final calculation for the coefficient of $x^2$?\nStudent：My final calculation was just $5a$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly calculated the total coefficient of $x^2$ as only $5a$, ignoring the $10$ from $1 \\times x^2$. What is the correct total coefficient?\nStudent：The correct total coefficient is $10 + 5a$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the total coefficient as $10 + 5a$. What was your mistake in the initial calculation?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You initially only considered the term from $a x \\times x$ and ignored the term from $1 \\times x^2$. What was the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(1 + x)^5$?\nStudent：The coefficient of $x^2$ in $(1 + x)^5$ is 10.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(1 + x)^5$ as 10. Why did you not include this in your initial calculation?\nStudent：I just focused on multiplying $a x$ by the $x$ term, and didn't think about the $x^2$ term from $(1 + x)^5$.\nTeacher：You neglected to include the contribution from $1 \\times x^2$ in your initial calculation. What is the correct value of $a$?\nStudent：The correct value of $a$ is $-1$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the correct value of $a$ as $-1$. However, your initial reasoning was flawed because you only considered one part of the product. What was the error in your initial calculation?",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: 0\nSocratic Method: 1\nAdherence to Rules: 1\n\nThe teacher did not successfully identify the student's error as the student did not respond with \"zzc,\" indicating a lack of understanding. The teacher's questioning was somewhat effective in probing the student's thought process, but it did not fully lead the student to recognize their strategic error. Additionally, the teacher repeated similar questions, which may have contributed to the student's confusion. The adherence to rules was mostly followed, but the teacher could have been more concise and varied in their questioning approach.",
