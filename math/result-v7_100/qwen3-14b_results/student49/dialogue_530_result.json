    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A.\nTeacher：What is the solution set for $A = \\{x \\mid x^2 - 2x > 0\\}$?\nStudent：The solution set for $A$ is $(-\\infty,0)\\cup(2,+\\infty)$.\nTeacher：Teacher：What is the solution set for $B = \\{x \\mid -\\sqrt{5} < x < \\sqrt{5}\\}$?\nStudent：The solution set for $B$ is $(-\\sqrt{5},\\sqrt{5})$.\nTeacher：What is the intersection of $A = (-\\infty, 0) \\cup (2, +\\infty)$ and $B = (-\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{5})$?\nStudent：The intersection is $(-\\sqrt{5}, 0)$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of the intersection is incomplete. What about the part of $A$ that overlaps with $B$ beyond 0?\nStudent：You're right, there’s also $(2,\\sqrt{5})$ from $A$ that overlaps with $B$. So the full intersection is $(-\\sqrt{5},0)\\cup(2,\\sqrt{5})$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the intersection as $(-\\sqrt{5}, 0) \\cup (2, \\sqrt{5})$. What does this tell you about option A?\nStudent：Option A is incorrect because the intersection is not empty.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that option A is incorrect. What does this tell you about the other options?\nStudent：Option B, C, and D could still be possible; I need to check the relationships between the sets for those options.\nTeacher：You correctly dismissed option A. What is the union of $A = (-\\infty, 0) \\cup (2, +\\infty)$ and $B = (-\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{5})$?\nStudent：The union is $(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\sqrt{5}) \\cup (2, +\\infty)$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of the union is incomplete. What about the overlap between $B$ and $A$?\nStudent：The overlap would add $(2, \\sqrt{5})$ as well, so the union is $(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\sqrt{5}) \\cup (2, +\\infty)$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of the union is incomplete. What about the interval between $\\sqrt{5}$ and 2?\nStudent：The interval $(\\sqrt{5}, 2)$ is not included in either $A$ or $B$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that the union excludes $(\\sqrt{5}, 2)$. What does this tell you about option B?\nStudent：Option B is incorrect because $A \\cup B$ does not cover all real numbers; $(\\sqrt{5}, 2)$ is missing.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that option B is incorrect. What does this tell you about options C and D?\nStudent：For option C, not all elements of $B$ are in $A$, so $B \\nsubseteq A$. For option D, not all elements of $A$ are in $B$, so $A \\nsubseteq B$.\nTeacher：You correctly ruled out options A, B, C, and D. However, this suggests there may be an error in the question or your initial understanding of the options. Can you recheck the problem statement?\nStudent：I just checked. The problem statement and options are as given: A, B, C, D.\nTeacher：You correctly ruled out options A, B, C, and D.
