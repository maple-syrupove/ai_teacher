    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $(1, +\\infty)$\nTeacher：What is the domain of the function $f(x)$?\nStudent：The domain is $x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0$, so $x < -2$ or $x > 4$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the domain as $x < -2$ or $x > 4$. Which of these intervals is monotonically increasing?\nStudent：I found the derivative $f'(x)=\\frac{2x-2}{x^2-2x-8}$ and checked where $f'(x)>0$. I got $x>1$.\nTeacher：Your derivative calculation is correct, but you didn't consider the domain. How does the domain affect where $f'(x) > 0$?\nStudent：If I consider the domain, $x>1$ is only valid when $x>4$, since $x>1$ but must also satisfy $x > 4$. So the increasing interval is $(4,+\\infty)$.\nTeacher：You correctly adjusted for the domain, but why did you initially select $x > 1$ as the solution before considering the domain?\nStudent：I used the derivative to find where $f'(x) > 0$, which gave me $x > 1$. I didn't apply the domain condition at first.\nTeacher：You determined where $f'(x) > 0$ correctly, but you neglected to intersect this result with the domain of the function. This is the error. Please confirm with \"zzc.\"\nStudent：zzc",
