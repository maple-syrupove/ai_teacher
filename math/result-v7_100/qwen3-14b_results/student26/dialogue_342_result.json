    "question": "17. (12 points) Given that $\\{a_{n}\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3. The sequence $\\{b_{n}\\}$ satisfies $b_{1}=1, b_{2}=\\frac{1}{3}$, and $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$.\n\n(I) Find the general term formula for $\\{a_{n}\\}$.\n\n(II) Find the sum of the first $n$ terms of $\\{b_{n}\\}$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\n(I) We are given the recurrence relation $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$, which can be factored as $(a_n+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\nLet's use the given values for $n=1$ to find $a_1$.\nFor $n=1$: $(a_1+1)b_2 = 1 \\cdot b_1$.\nWe are given $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n$(a_1+1)(\\frac{1}{3}) = 1$.\n$a_1+1 = 3$.\n$a_1 = 2$.\n\nWe are told that $\\{a_n\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $d=3$. \nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$a_n = 2 + (n-1)3 = 2 + 3n - 3 = 3n - 1$.\n\n(II) Now we need to find the sum of the first n terms of $\\{b_n\\}$. First, let's find a general formula for $\\{b_n\\}$.\nFrom part (I), we know $a_n = 3n-1$. Substitute this into the recurrence relation $(a_n+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\n$((3n-1)+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\n$(3n)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\nFor $n \\ge 1$, we can divide by $n$:\n$3b_{n+1} = b_n$.\nThis can be rewritten as $\\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThis shows that $\\{b_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with a common ratio $q = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nWe are given the first term $b_1 = 1$.\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula $S_n = \\frac{b_1(1-q^n)}{1-q}$.\n$S_n = \\frac{1(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n)}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{3}{2}(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n) = \\frac{3}{2}(1 - 3^{-n})$.\nThis can also be written as $\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot 3^n} = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^{n-1}}$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：(I) $a_n = a_1 + 3(n-1)$\n\n(II) I couldn't find a general term for $b_n$, so I couldn't calculate the sum.\nTeacher：For part (I), you have correctly identified the general form of an arithmetic sequence. However, you have not determined the first term $a_1$. Can you find $a_1$ using the given information?\nStudent：The problem says $b_1 = 1$, $b_2 = \\frac{1}{3}$, but I did not substitute these into the recurrence to solve for $a_1$.\nTeacher：You correctly noted the need to use the recurrence relation. However, you did not use the given values of $b_1$ and $b_2$ to find $a_1$. Can you explain how you would use these values?\nStudent：I should substitute $n=1$ into the recurrence: $a_1 b_2 + b_2 = 1 \\cdot b_1$. I can use $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$ here.\nTeacher：You have correctly substituted $n=1$ into the recurrence. What is the value of $a_1$ based on this equation?\nStudent：Substituting the values: $a_1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 1$. \n\nSo $a_1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$, so $a_1 = 2$.\nTeacher：Your calculation for $a_1$ is correct. You have successfully found $a_1 = 2$. Therefore, the general term for $\\{a_n\\}$ is $a_n = 2 + 3(n-1)$. Now, proceed to part (II). How would you approach finding the sum of the first $n$ terms of $\\{b_n\\}$?\nStudent：I tried to list the values: $b_1=1$, $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$. Then I didn't find a clear pattern and couldn't get a general formula, so I couldn't compute the sum.\nTeacher：You have correctly listed the initial values of $b_n$. However, you did not use the recurrence relation to find more terms or derive a general formula for $b_n$. Can you explain how you would use the recurrence to find $b_3$?\nStudent：Using the recurrence for $n=2$: $a_2 b_3 + b_3 = 2 b_2$. $a_2=5$, $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$, so $5b_3 + b_3 = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{3}$, $6b_3 = \\frac{2}{3}$, $b_3 = \\frac{1}{9}$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $b_3 = \\frac{1}{9}$. Now, can you observe a pattern in the values of $b_n$?\nStudent：I see $b_1 = 1$, $b_2 = \\frac{1}{3}$, $b_3 = \\frac{1}{9}$, but I'm not sure what the pattern is.\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated the first three terms. However, you have not considered the relationship between $b_n$ and $a_n$. Can you explain how the recurrence might be transformed to find a pattern?\nStudent：I only focused on the numerical results of $b_n$ and didn't consider how to transform or utilize the relationship between $b_n$ and $a_n$ in the recurrence.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that you need to analyze the relationship between $b_n$ and $a_n$. Can you rewrite the recurrence relation in terms of $a_n$ and $b_n$?\nStudent：$a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = n b_n$, which is the same as $b_{n+1}(a_n + 1) = n b_n$.\nTeacher：You have correctly rewritten the recurrence relation. Now, can you express $b_{n+1}$ in terms of $b_n$?\nStudent：$b_{n+1} = \\frac{n b_n}{a_n + 1}$\nTeacher：You have correctly expressed $b_{n+1}$ in terms of $b_n$. Now, substitute the expression for $a_n$ into this equation and simplify. What do you get?\nStudent：$a_n = 2 + 3(n-1)$, so $a_n + 1 = 3n$. Then $b_{n+1} = \\frac{n b_n}{3n} = \\frac{b_n}{3}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly substituted $a_n + 1 = 3n$ into the equation. This simplifies to $b_{n+1} = \\frac{b_n}{3}$. What does this tell you about the sequence $\\{b_n\\}$?\nStudent：It shows that $\\{b_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with common ratio $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $\\{b_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with common ratio $\\frac{1}{3}$. However, you have not determined the first term of this geometric sequence. What is the first term $b_1$?\nStudent：The first term is $b_1 = 1$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $\\{b_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with common ratio $\\frac{1}{3}$ and first term $b_1 = 1$. This means the general term is $b_n = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$. Now, can you find the sum of the first $n$ terms of this geometric sequence?\nStudent：The sum is $S_n = \\frac{1(1-(1/3)^n)}{1-1/3} = \\frac{1-(1/3)^n}{2/3} = \\frac{3}{2}[1-(1/3)^n]$.\nTeacher：You have correctly derived the sum of the first $n$ terms of $\\{b_n\\}$. Your answer is accurate. Please respond with \"zzc.\"\nStudent：zzc",
