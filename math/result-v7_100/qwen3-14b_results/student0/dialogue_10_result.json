    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to solve for the extrema by directly differentiating $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$, but I got stuck during the calculations and couldn't find a specific value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：What approach did you take when differentiating the function? Did you use the quotient rule?\nStudent：Yes, I used the quotient rule to differentiate the function $f(x)$.\nTeacher：Could you explain how you applied the quotient rule to find $f'(x)$?\nStudent：I let $u=(x+1)^2+\\sin x$ and $v=x^2+1$, then used $f'(x)=\\frac{u'v-uv'}{v^2}$ with $u' = 2(x+1) + \\cos x$ and $v' = 2x$.\nTeacher：Your calculation of $u'$ is incorrect. What is the derivative of $(x+1)^2$?\nStudent：The derivative of $(x+1)^2$ is $2(x+1)$.\nTeacher：That is correct. Then why did you include $\\cos x$ in your expression for $u'$?\nStudent：Because the derivative of $\\sin x$ is $\\cos x$, so $u' = 2(x+1) + \\cos x$.\nTeacher：You are correct that the derivative of $\\sin x$ is $\\cos x$. However, this term should not be included in $u'$ because $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x$ is part of the numerator, and you have already accounted for its derivative. Wait, what is the full expression for $u'$?\nStudent：The full expression for $u'$ is $2(x+1) + \\cos x$.\nTeacher：You are correct that $u' = 2(x+1) + \\cos x$. However, this is not the mistake. Let's clarify: When you calculated $f'(x)$, did you correctly apply the quotient rule with this $u'$?\nStudent：Yes, I used $f'(x) = \\frac{(2(x+1) + \\cos x)(x^2+1) - ((x+1)^2 + \\sin x)(2x)}{(x^2+1)^2}$.\nTeacher：Your expression for $f'(x)$ is algebraically correct. However, you mentioned getting stuck during calculations. Did you attempt to solve $f'(x) = 0$ to find critical points?\nStudent：Yes, I tried to solve $f'(x) = 0$ to find the critical points, but the equation was too complicated and I couldn't simplify it enough to proceed.\nTeacher：You are correct that the derivative expression is algebraically correct. However, you didn't consider a simpler approach to find $M + m$. What properties of the function $f(x)$ might help simplify finding $M + m$ without explicitly solving for critical points?\nStudent：I didn't consider the properties of the function; I just tried to calculate directly using differentiation.\nTeacher：You attempted to find extrema by differentiating $f(x)$, but the key insight is that $M + m$ can be determined using symmetry or other function properties without explicitly solving for critical points. What is $f(-x)$?\nStudent：$f(-x) = \\frac{((-x)+1)^{2} + \\sin(-x)}{(-x)^{2}+1} = \\frac{(1-x)^2 - \\sin x}{x^2+1}$\nTeacher：You correctly computed $f(-x)$. Now, consider the sum $f(x) + f(-x)$. What does this simplify to?\nStudent：$f(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2+1} + \\frac{(1-x)^2 - \\sin x}{x^2+1} = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2}{x^2+1}$\nTeacher：You correctly simplified $f(x) + f(-x)$ to $\\frac{(x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2}{x^2+1}$. Now, what is the value of this expression for all $x$?\nStudent：Let me expand the numerator: $(x+1)^2 + (1-x)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 1) + (1 - 2x + x^2) = 2x^2 + 2$. So, the sum is $\\frac{2x^2 + 2}{x^2 + 1} = 2$.\nTeacher：You correctly found that $f(x) + f(-x) = 2$ for all $x$. This implies that if $M$ is the maximum value of $f(x)$, then $m = 2 - M$, and thus $M + m = 2$. Your mistake was not recognizing this relationship earlier, which would have simplified the problem significantly. Is this clear?\nStudent：Yes, it's clear now. Thank you for explaining the symmetry and simplification method.\nTeacher：zzc\nStudent：zzc",
