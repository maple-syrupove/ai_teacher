    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: The maximum value is $2.484$.\nTeacher：How did you determine the maximum value of the function? Did you consider critical points or endpoints?\nStudent：I tried to rewrite the function by completing the square when I saw $\\sin^2 x$ and then found its maximum value from the expression.\nTeacher：Can you show me the rewritten form of the function after completing the square?\nStudent：Sure. I rewrote it as $\\left(\\sin x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 - 1$.\nTeacher：Your rewritten form is incorrect. What is the correct identity for $\\sin^2 x$?\nStudent：The correct identity is $\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x$.\nTeacher：You used the identity $\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x$, but this led to an incorrect completion of the square. What was your next step after substituting this identity into the original function?\nStudent：After substituting, I tried to write everything in terms of $\\cos x$, then attempted to complete the square with respect to $\\cos x$.\nTeacher：What expression did you obtain after substituting $\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x$ into the original function?\nStudent：After substituting, I got $1 - \\cos^2 x + \\sqrt{3} \\cos x - \\frac{3}{4}$.\nTeacher：You simplified the expression to $1 - \\cos^2 x + \\sqrt{3} \\cos x - \\frac{3}{4}$. What is the simplified form of this expression?\nStudent：The simplified form is $-\\cos^2 x + \\sqrt{3} \\cos x + \\frac{1}{4}$.\nTeacher：You simplified $1 - \\frac{3}{4}$ to $\\frac{1}{4}$. What is the correct value of $1 - \\frac{3}{4}$?\nStudent：The correct value is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified $1 - \\frac{3}{4}$ to $\\frac{1}{4}$. What did you do next with the expression $-\\cos^2 x + \\sqrt{3} \\cos x + \\frac{1}{4}$?\nStudent：Next, I tried to complete the square for the terms $-\\cos^2 x + \\sqrt{3}\\cos x$.\nTeacher：What is the coefficient of $\\cos^2 x$ in your expression?\nStudent：The coefficient of $\\cos^2 x$ is $-1$.\nTeacher：You factored out the coefficient of $\\cos^2 x$ before completing the square. What was the expression after factoring out $-1$?\nStudent：After factoring out $-1$, the expression becomes $-\\left(\\cos^2 x - \\sqrt{3} \\cos x\\right) + \\frac{1}{4}$.\nTeacher：What is the next step in completing the square for $\\cos^2 x - \\sqrt{3} \\cos x$?\nStudent：The next step is to write $\\cos^2 x - \\sqrt{3} \\cos x$ as $(\\cos x - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 - (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2$.\nTeacher：You wrote $\\cos^2 x - \\sqrt{3} \\cos x$ as $(\\cos x - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 - (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2$. What is the correct value of $(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2$?\nStudent：The correct value is $\\frac{3}{4}$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified $(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = \\frac{3}{4}$. What was the resulting expression after completing the square?\nStudent：After completing the square, I got $-\\left[(\\cos x - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 - \\frac{3}{4}\\right] + \\frac{1}{4}$.\nTeacher：You simplified the expression incorrectly. What is the result of distributing the negative sign inside the brackets?\nStudent：Distributing the negative sign, it becomes $-(\\cos x - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 + \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}$.\nTeacher：You correctly distributed the negative sign. What is the simplified value of $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}$?\nStudent：The simplified value is $1$.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}$ to $1$. What is the final expression for the function after completing the square?\nStudent：The final expression is $-(\\cos x - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 + 1$.\nTeacher：You correctly completed the square, but your initial rewritten form was incorrect. What was your original claim for the rewritten form?\nStudent：My original claim was $(\\sin x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 - 1$.\nTeacher：Your original claim was $(\\sin x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 - 1$. This is incorrect. What is the correct form after completing the square?\nStudent：The correct form after completing the square is $-(\\cos x - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 + 1$.\nTeacher：Your original claim was incorrect because you attempted to complete the square in terms of $\\sin x$, but the correct completion of the square was done in terms of $\\cos x$. You incorrectly associated the squared term with $\\sin x$ instead of $\\cos x$. What was your reasoning for completing the square in terms of $\\sin x$?\nStudent：I saw $\\sin^2 x$ in the function and thought that completing the square should start with $\\sin x$, so I proceeded with that variable.\nTeacher：You incorrectly completed the square in terms of $\\sin x$ instead of $\\cos x$. What was the original function you were working with?",
