    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$\\tan\\alpha=\\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)$\nTeacher：Your approach assumes that $\\tan(A - B) = \\tan A - \\tan B$, which is incorrect. What is the correct identity for $\\tan(A - B)$?\nStudent：The correct identity is $\\tan(A-B) = \\frac{\\tan A - \\tan B}{1 + \\tan A \\tan B}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the identity, but how did you proceed to solve for $\\tan \\alpha$ using this identity?\nStudent：I didn't actually use this identity in my solution. I just added $\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ to both sides and wrote $\\tan\\alpha=\\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)$.\nTeacher：You assumed that if $\\tan(\\alpha - \\beta) = x$, then $\\tan \\alpha = \\tan(x + \\beta)$, which is not valid. Why is this assumption incorrect?\nStudent：Because the tangent function is not linear, and you cannot just add inside the argument like that. The relationship involves the tangent addition formula, not simple addition.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that the tangent function is not linear. However, you did not apply the correct inverse steps to solve for $\\tan \\alpha$. What equation should you set up using the identity?\nStudent：If I use the identity, I should set up $\\frac{\\tan \\alpha - \\tan \\frac{5\\pi}{4}}{1 + \\tan \\alpha \\tan \\frac{5\\pi}{4}} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly set up the equation. What is the value of $\\tan \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$?\nStudent：The value of $\\tan \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ is $1$.\nTeacher：Correct. Now substitute this value into the equation and solve for $\\tan \\alpha$. What is your next step?\nStudent：I substitute $1$ in: $\\frac{\\tan\\alpha - 1}{1 + \\tan\\alpha \\cdot 1} = \\frac{1}{5}$. Then I solve for $\\tan\\alpha$.\nTeacher：You have correctly substituted $\\tan \\frac{5\\pi}{4} = 1$. What is the next algebraic step to isolate $\\tan \\alpha$?\nStudent：I cross-multiply: $5(\\tan\\alpha - 1) = 1(1 + \\tan\\alpha)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly cross-multiplied. What is the resulting equation after expanding both sides?\nStudent：$5\\tan\\alpha - 5 = 1 + \\tan\\alpha$\nTeacher：Correct. Now, what is the next step to collect like terms and solve for $\\tan \\alpha$?\nStudent：I subtract $\\tan\\alpha$ from both sides: $5\\tan\\alpha - \\tan\\alpha = 1 + 5$.\nTeacher：You have incorrectly moved terms. What is $5\\tan\\alpha - \\tan\\alpha$ and what is $1 + 5$?\nStudent：$5\\tan\\alpha - \\tan\\alpha$ is $4\\tan\\alpha$, and $1 + 5$ is $6$.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified both sides. What is the final equation after this step?\nStudent：$4\\tan\\alpha = 6$\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified to $4\\tan\\alpha = 6$. What is the value of $\\tan\\alpha$?\nStudent：$\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}$\nTeacher：You have correctly solved for $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$.
