    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Let $|\\vec{b}|=x$.\nTeacher：What is the formula for the magnitude of a vector difference?\nStudent：The formula is $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}| = \\sqrt{(2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}) \\cdot (2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b})}$.\nTeacher：Correct. What is the result of expanding this dot product?\nStudent：Expanding, $(2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}) \\cdot (2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}) = 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{a} - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} + \\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{b}$.\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a}$ given $|\\vec{a}| = 1$?\nStudent：$\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a} = 1$.\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$ in terms of $|\\vec{a}|$, $|\\vec{b}|$, and the angle between them?\nStudent：$\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = |\\vec{a}|\\,|\\vec{b}|\\,\\cos 45^\\circ$.\nTeacher：Correct. What is the value of $|\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}|$?\nStudent：$|\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}| = |\\vec{b}|^2 = x^2$.\nTeacher：You stated $|\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}| = x^2$. What is $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}$?\nStudent：$\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} = |\\vec{b}|^2$, which is $x^2$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} = x^2$. What is the value of $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2$ based on this?\nStudent：$|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = 4 \\cdot 1 - 4|\\vec{a}|\\,|\\vec{b}|\\,\\cos 45^\\circ + x^2$.\nTeacher：You wrote $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = 4 \\cdot 1 - 4|\\vec{a}|\\,|\\vec{b}|\\,\\cos 45^\\circ + x^2$. What is the correct sign of the middle term?\nStudent：The sign should be negative; the term is $-4|\\vec{a}|\\,|\\vec{b}|\\,\\cos 45^\\circ$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the sign as negative. What is the value of $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2$ given it equals $\\sqrt{10}$?\nStudent：Since $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}| = \\sqrt{10}$, we have $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = 10$. So, $4 - 4|\\vec{a}||\\vec{b}|\\cos45^\\circ + x^2 = 10$.\nTeacher：You correctly substituted $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = 10$. What is the value of $|\\vec{a}|$?\nStudent：$|\\vec{a}| = 1$.\nTeacher：You correctly substituted $|\\vec{a}| = 1$. What is the equation now in terms of $x$ and $\\cos 45^\\circ$?\nStudent：The equation is $4 - 4x\\cos 45^\\circ + x^2 = 10$.\nTeacher：You have correctly substituted $|\\vec{a}| = 1$. What is the value of $\\cos 45^\\circ$?\nStudent：$\\cos 45^\\circ = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified $\\cos 45^\\circ = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. What is the equation after substituting this value?\nStudent：After substitution, the equation is $4 - 4x \\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + x^2 = 10$.\nTeacher：Simplify the middle term. What is $4x \\cdot \\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$?\nStudent：$4x \\cdot \\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2x\\sqrt{2}$.\nTeacher：You simplified $4x \\cdot \\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ correctly as $2x\\sqrt{2}$. What is the resulting equation after this simplification?\nStudent：The equation is $4 - 2x\\sqrt{2} + x^2 = 10$.\nTeacher：You have simplified the middle term correctly. What is the next step to solve for $x$?\nStudent：Bring all terms to one side: $x^2 - 2x\\sqrt{2} + 4 - 10 = 0$, so $x^2 - 2x\\sqrt{2} - 6 = 0$.\nTeacher：You have moved all terms correctly to one side. What is the quadratic equation you now need to solve?\nStudent：The quadratic equation is $x^2 - 2x\\sqrt{2} - 6 = 0$.\nTeacher：You have correctly formed the quadratic equation. What is the discriminant of this quadratic equation?\nStudent：The discriminant is $(-2\\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-6) = 8 + 24 = 32$.\nTeacher：You calculated the discriminant as $32$, but what is the correct value of $(-2\\sqrt{2})^2$?\nStudent：$(-2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 \\times 2 = 8$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $(-2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$. What is the correct value of the discriminant?",
