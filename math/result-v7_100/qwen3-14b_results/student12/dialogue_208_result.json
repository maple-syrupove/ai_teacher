Which elements of $B$ actually meet $x \\geq 1$?\nStudent：The elements of $B$ that actually meet $x \\geq 1$ are $1$ and $2$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $1$ and $2$ meet $x \\geq 1$, but you initially selected option D, which includes $0$. Why did you include $0$ in your answer?\nStudent：At first, I thought the intersection included all of B without considering the definition of A carefully.\nTeacher：You included $0$ in your answer even though it does not satisfy $x \\geq 1$.
