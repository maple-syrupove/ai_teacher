    "question": "22. In the Cartesian coordinate system $xOy$, a polar coordinate system is established with the origin as the pole and the positive x-axis as the polar axis. The polar equation of a curve $C$ is $\\rho=2 \\sqrt{2} \\cos \\theta$.\n\n(1) Convert the polar equation of C to a Cartesian equation.\n\n(2) Let point A have Cartesian coordinates $(1,0)$, and let M be a moving point on C. Point P satisfies the vector equation $\\overrightarrow{A P}=\\sqrt{2} \\overrightarrow{A M}$. Write the parametric equation of the locus of P, denoted as $C_{1}$, and determine if C and $C_{1}$ have any common points.\n",
    "correct_answer": "【Detailed Explanation】(1) The polar equation of curve C is $\\rho=2 \\sqrt{2} \\cos \\theta$.\nTo convert to a Cartesian equation, we can multiply both sides by $\\rho$ (assuming $\\rho \\neq 0$. If $\\rho=0$, the point is the origin, which is included in the resulting equation).\n$\\rho^{2}=2 \\sqrt{2} \\rho \\cos \\theta$.\nUsing the conversion formulas $x^2+y^2 = \\rho^2$ and $x = \\rho\\cos\\theta$, we substitute them into the equation:\n$x^{2}+y^{2}=2 \\sqrt{2} x$.\nRearranging and completing the square to identify the shape:\n$x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + y^2 = 0$\n$(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + (\\sqrt{2})^2) - (\\sqrt{2})^2 + y^2 = 0$\n$(x-\\sqrt{2})^{2} + y^{2} = 2$.\nThis is the equation of a circle C with center $(\\sqrt{2}, 0)$ and radius $r = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\n(2) Let the coordinates of P be $(x, y)$.\nSince M is a moving point on the circle C, we can represent its coordinates parametrically. The center of C is $(\\sqrt{2}, 0)$ and its radius is $\\sqrt{2}$. So, a parametric representation for M is:\n$M(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2}\\cos\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}\\sin\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha$ is the parameter.\n\nWe are given the vector relation $\\overrightarrow{AP} = \\sqrt{2}\\overrightarrow{AM}$.\nLet's write the vectors in terms of coordinates. A is $(1,0)$.\n$\\overrightarrow{AP} = (x-1, y-0) = (x-1, y)$.\n$\\overrightarrow{AM} = ((\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2}\\cos\\alpha) - 1, (\\sqrt{2}\\sin\\alpha) - 0) = (\\sqrt{2}-1 + \\sqrt{2}\\cos\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}\\sin\\alpha)$.\n\nNow, substitute these into the vector equation:\n$(x-1, y) = \\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{2}-1 + \\sqrt{2}\\cos\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}\\sin\\alpha)$\n$(x-1, y) = (2 - \\sqrt{2} + 2\\cos\\alpha, 2\\sin\\alpha)$.\nEquating the components, we get the parametric equations for P:\n$x-1 = 2 - \\sqrt{2} + 2\\cos\\alpha \\implies x = 3 - \\sqrt{2} + 2\\cos\\alpha$\n$y = 2\\sin\\alpha$\nSo, the parametric equations for the locus $C_1$ are $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}x=3-\\sqrt{2}+2 \\cos \\alpha \\\\ y=2 \\sin \\alpha\\end{array}\\right.$ (where $\\alpha$ is the parameter).\n\nThis is a circle $C_1$ with center $(3-\\sqrt{2}, 0)$ and radius $R=2$.\n\nTo determine if C and $C_1$ have common points, we compare the distance between their centers with the sum and difference of their radii.\nCenter of C: $(\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, radius $r = \\sqrt{2}$.\nCenter of $C_1$: $(3-\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, radius $R=2$.\nDistance between centers, $d = |(3-\\sqrt{2}) - \\sqrt{2}| = |3-2\\sqrt{2}|$. \nSince $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$, $2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.828$, so $3-2\\sqrt{2}$ is positive. $d = 3-2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.172$.\n\nSum of radii: $R+r = 2 + \\sqrt{2} \\approx 3.414$.\nDifference of radii: $|R-r| = |2 - \\sqrt{2}| = 2 - \\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.586$.\n\nWe compare the distance $d$ with the sum and difference of radii. \n$d = 3-2\\sqrt{2}$. Is $d < R-r$? Is $3-2\\sqrt{2} < 2-\\sqrt{2}$? \nThis simplifies to $1 < \\sqrt{2}$, which is true.\nSince the distance between the centers is less than the difference of the radii ($d < |R-r|$), one circle is contained entirely within the other and they do not touch. Therefore, the two circles have no common points.\n",

Now, what is the parametric representation of point M on curve C?\nStudent：Point M on C can be represented as $x_1 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\theta\\cos\\theta$, $y_1 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta$.\nTeacher：Your parametric representation of point M is incorrect. What is the standard parametric form for a circle in Cartesian coordinates?\nStudent：The standard parametric form for a circle is $x = a + r\\cos\\theta$, $y = b + r\\sin\\theta$, where $(a,b)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the standard parametric form of a circle. How did you derive your parametric equations for point M?\nStudent：I substituted $\\rho = 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\theta$ into $x = \\rho\\cos\\theta$, $y = \\rho\\sin\\theta$, to get $x_1 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\theta\\cos\\theta$, $y_1 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly substituted $\\rho = 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\theta$ into the parametric equations.

What is the relationship between $\\rho$ and the Cartesian coordinates $x$ and $y$?\nStudent：The relationship is $x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$, $y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$.\nTeacher：You correctly stated the relationship between polar and Cartesian coordinates. Why did you include an extra $\\cos\\theta$ in your expression for $x_1$?\nStudent：I thought that since $\\rho = 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\theta$, I needed to multiply by another $\\cos\\theta$, so I wrote $x_1 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\theta \\cos\\theta$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly multiplied by an extra $\\cos\\theta$. The correct parametric equations for point M are $x_1 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos^2\\theta$, $y_1 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta$. Is this clear?\nStudent：Yes, it is clear. The parametric equations for point M should be $x_1 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos^2\\theta$, $y_1 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta$.\nTeacher：You now have the correct parametric equations for point M. What is the next step in finding the parametric equation of the locus of P?\nStudent：The next step is to use $\\overrightarrow{AP} = \\sqrt{2}\\;\\overrightarrow{AM}$ to write $x_p = 1 + \\sqrt{2}(x_1-1)$ and $y_p = \\sqrt{2} y_1$, then substitute $x_1$ and $y_1$ using their parametric forms.\nTeacher：You correctly expressed $x_p$ and $y_p$ in terms of $x_1$ and $y_1$. What is the result of substituting the parametric equations for $x_1$ and $y_1$ into these expressions?\nStudent：After substitution,  \n$x_p = 1 + \\sqrt{2}(2\\sqrt{2}\\cos^2\\theta - 1)$  \n$y_p = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2} \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta$  \nSo, $x_p = 1 + 4\\cos^2\\theta - \\sqrt{2}$, $y_p = 4\\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly simplified $x_p = 1 + \\sqrt{2}(2\\sqrt{2}\\cos^2\\theta - 1)$. What is the correct simplification?\nStudent：The correct simplification is $x_p = 1 + (\\sqrt{2} \\times 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos^2\\theta) - \\sqrt{2} \\times 1 = 1 + 4\\cos^2\\theta - \\sqrt{2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified the expression for $x_p$. What is the next step in determining the parametric equation of $C_1$?\nStudent：The next step is to write the parametric equations of $C_1$ as $x_p = 1 + 4\\cos^2\\theta - \\sqrt{2}$, $y_p = 4\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta$, with $\\theta$ as the parameter.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified $x_p$ and $y_p$. What is the Cartesian equation of $C_1$?\nStudent：I try to eliminate $\\theta$:  \nLet $x_p = 1 + 4\\cos^2\\theta - \\sqrt{2}$, $y_p = 4\\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta$.  \nNow, $y_p = 2\\sin 2\\theta$, and $x_p = 1 + 4\\cos^2\\theta - \\sqrt{2}$.  \nI set $t = \\cos\\theta$, $x_p = 1 + 4t^2 - \\sqrt{2}$, $y_p = 4t\\sqrt{1-t^2}$.  \nBut I got stuck since the elimination was complicated.\nTeacher：You have not yet derived the Cartesian equation of $C_1$. What is the relationship between $\\cos^2\\theta$ and $\\sin 2\\theta$?\nStudent：$\\cos^2\\theta = \\frac{1+\\cos 2\\theta}{2}$, and $\\sin 2\\theta = 2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the trigonometric identities. How can you use these to eliminate $\\theta$ from the parametric equations of $C_1$?\nStudent：I can try substituting $\\cos^2\\theta = \\frac{1+\\cos 2\\theta}{2}$ into $x_p$, and $y_p = 2\\sin 2\\theta$. Then, express everything in terms of $\\cos 2\\theta$ and $\\sin 2\\theta$ to relate $x_p$ and $y_p$.\nTeacher：You are on the right track. What is the expression for $x_p$ after substituting $\\cos^2\\theta = \\frac{1+\\cos 2\\theta}{2}$?\nStudent：$x_p = 1 + 4 \\left(\\frac{1+\\cos 2\\theta}{2}\\right) - \\sqrt{2} = 1 + 2(1+\\cos 2\\theta) - \\sqrt{2} = 3 + 2\\cos 2\\theta - \\sqrt{2}$\nTeacher：You correctly substituted $\\cos^2\\theta$ into the expression for $x_p$. What is the next step in expressing $x_p$ and $y_p$ in terms of a single trigonometric function?\nStudent：The next step is to let $u = 2\\theta$, then $x_p = 3 + 2\\cos u - \\sqrt{2}$ and $y_p = 2\\sin u$, so both $x_p$ and $y_p$ are in terms of $u$.\nTeacher：You have correctly transformed the parametric equations into a form involving $u$. What does this imply about the shape of $C_1$?\nStudent：It implies that $C_1$ also traces out a circle, since $x_p = 3 + 2\\cos u - \\sqrt{2}$ and $y_p = 2\\sin u$ are standard parametric equations of a circle.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $C_1$ is a circle. Now, what is the center and radius of this circle?\nStudent：The center of $C_1$ is at $(3-\\sqrt{2},\\, 0)$, and the radius is $2$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the center and radius of $C_1$. Now, what is the center and radius of curve $C$?",
