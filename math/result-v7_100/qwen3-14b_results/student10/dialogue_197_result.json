    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：How did you arrive at $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$?\nStudent：I thought since $E$ is on $AD$ and $D$ is on $BC$, $E$ would still have the same direction to $B$ as $A$ does, so I wrote $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that the direction from $E$ to $B$ is the same as from $A$ to $B$, which isn't necessarily true. What do you know about vectors related to midpoints and medians?\nStudent：I know that if a point is the midpoint of a segment, like $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$, its position vector can be written as the average of the position vectors of $A$ and $D$. Similarly, the median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.\nTeacher：You correctly identified midpoints, but how did you express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ using these relationships? Did you account for the vector from $E$ to $B$ properly?\nStudent：I only wrote $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$ directly, without using the positions of $E$ or $D$.\nTeacher：You did not use the relationships between the midpoints to express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ correctly. What is the position vector of point $E$ in terms of $A$ and $D$?\nStudent：The position vector of $E$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{A} + \\vec{D})$.\nTeacher：Correct. Now, express $\\vec{D}$ in terms of $\\vec{B}$ and $\\vec{C}$.\nStudent：$\\vec{D}$ is the midpoint of $BC$, so $\\vec{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{B} + \\vec{C})$.\nTeacher：Now, substitute $\\vec{D}$ into the expression for $\\vec{E}$. What is $\\vec{E}$ in terms of $\\vec{A}$, $\\vec{B}$, and $\\vec{C}$?\nStudent：$\\vec{E} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\vec{A} + \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{B} + \\vec{C}) \\right ) = \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{A} + \\frac{1}{4} \\vec{B} + \\frac{1}{4} \\vec{C}$.\nTeacher：Now, how would you express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ using the position vectors of $E$ and $B$?\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\vec{B} - \\vec{E} = \\vec{B} - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{A} + \\frac{1}{4} \\vec{B} + \\frac{1}{4} \\vec{C} \\right )$.\nTeacher：Simplify the expression for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. What do you get?\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\vec{B} - \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{A} - \\frac{1}{4}\\vec{B} - \\frac{1}{4}\\vec{C} = \\frac{3}{4}\\vec{B} - \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{A} - \\frac{1}{4}\\vec{C}$\nTeacher：Your simplification is correct, but you have not expressed $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$. How can you rewrite $\\vec{B} - \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{A} - \\frac{1}{4}\\vec{B} - \\frac{1}{4}\\vec{C}$ using $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$?\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\vec{B} - \\vec{A}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC} = \\vec{C} - \\vec{A}$. If I substitute, I think I should express $\\vec{B}$ and $\\vec{C}$ in terms of these.\nTeacher：You're on the right track. Let's see—how would you express $\\vec{B}$ and $\\vec{C}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$?\nStudent：$\\vec{B} = \\vec{A} + \\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\vec{C} = \\vec{A} + \\overrightarrow{AC}$.\nTeacher：Correct. Substitute these into your expression for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. What is the result?\nStudent：Substituting, I get:\n$\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\frac{3}{4}(\\vec{A} + \\overrightarrow{AB}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{A} - \\frac{1}{4}(\\vec{A} + \\overrightarrow{AC})$\nTeacher：You substituted $\\vec{B}$ and $\\vec{C}$ correctly, but you should simplify this expression to express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ solely in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$. What happens when you simplify the terms involving $\\vec{A}$?\nStudent：Collecting all $\\vec{A}$ terms:\n$\\frac{3}{4}\\vec{A} - \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{A} - \\frac{1}{4}\\vec{A} = 0$. So the $\\vec{A}$ terms cancel out.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the $\\vec{A}$ terms. What remains is $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\frac{3}{4}\\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{4}\\overrightarrow{AC}$. This matches option A. Your mistake was not completing the simplification to express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$. zzc\nStudent：zzc",
