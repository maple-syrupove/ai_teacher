    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D.\nTeacher：Why did you choose option D? What does it mean for two planes to be perpendicular to the same plane?\nStudent：If α and β are both perpendicular to the same plane, I thought that meant α and β must be in the same direction, so they are parallel.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that being perpendicular to the same plane forces two planes to be parallel. What if they intersect instead? Consider two planes both perpendicular to a third plane—could they still intersect?\nStudent：If two planes are both perpendicular to the same plane, they could still intersect with each other along a line within that perpendicular plane. They don't have to be parallel.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that two planes perpendicular to the same plane can intersect. What does this imply about the sufficiency of condition D for ensuring $\\alpha // \\beta$?\nStudent：It implies that condition D is not sufficient to guarantee that α and β are parallel, since they could intersect.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that condition D is not sufficient. However, what does this say about the necessity of condition D? Can two parallel planes ever fail to be perpendicular to the same plane?\nStudent：Two parallel planes will always be perpendicular to some plane, but so can non-parallel planes, so D is not necessary either.\nTeacher：You correctly concluded that D is not necessary. Now, consider option B: \"There are two intersecting lines in α that are parallel to β.\" Why might this be sufficient for α // β?\nStudent：If there are two intersecting lines in α that are both parallel to β, it means the entire plane α is parallel to plane β, since two intersecting lines determine a plane.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that if two intersecting lines in α are parallel to β, then α must be parallel to β. Why can't those lines be parallel to β without the entire plane α being parallel?\nStudent：Because two intersecting lines fully determine the plane α. If both are parallel to β, then all of α is parallel to β, as those lines span α and their direction is preserved.\nTeacher：You assume that if two intersecting lines in α are parallel to β, the entire plane α must be parallel to β. However, being parallel to β only implies direction alignment, not necessarily that α cannot intersect β. What defines plane parallelism?\nStudent：Plane parallelism means two planes have no intersection and are always the same distance apart everywhere; they do not share any points.\nTeacher：You correctly define plane parallelism. However, how does this relate to the condition that two intersecting lines in α being parallel to β ensure α // β? Could there be a scenario where those lines are parallel to β but α still intersects β?\nStudent：If two intersecting lines in α are both parallel to β, then α cannot intersect β, because the direction of α would be the same as β. Their intersection is not possible unless they coincide.\nTeacher：You believe that if two intersecting lines in α are parallel to β, then α cannot intersect β. However, this overlooks the fact that even if the lines are parallel to β, the plane α could still intersect β along a line not aligned with those two lines. What defines the relationship between the planes?\nStudent：The relationship is defined not just by the directions but also by their positions in space; even if directions are aligned, the planes could still intersect if they are not offset properly.\nTeacher：You correctly noted that direction alignment isn't enough to ensure parallelism. What specifically must be true about the two intersecting lines in α for them to guarantee α // β?\nStudent：Both intersecting lines in α must each be parallel to two intersecting lines in β, ensuring that the entire plane α is parallel to plane β.\nTeacher：You are assuming that parallelism of lines between planes guarantees plane parallelism, but the condition only states that the lines in α are parallel to β, not that they correspond to lines in β. What ensures that α and β don't intersect?\nStudent：The two planes must not only have the same direction, but also be offset so they never intersect—meaning their normal vectors are parallel and they do not share any points.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that normal vectors must be parallel and planes must not share points. However, how does this relate to the condition in option B? Does having two intersecting lines in α parallel to β ensure that α and β do not share any points?\nStudent：No, just having two intersecting lines in α parallel to β means they have the same direction, but it does not guarantee that the planes do not intersect; they could still coincide or intersect.\nTeacher：You correctly recognized that two intersecting lines in α being parallel to β does not guarantee α and β do not intersect. What specifically must be true about those lines to ensure α // β?\nStudent：The two intersecting lines in α must not only be parallel to β in direction, but α and β also must not share any points; that is, they must be distinct and have the same direction.\nTeacher：You are correct that the planes must not share any points, but option B does not guarantee this. Why does the existence of two intersecting lines in α that are parallel to β not ensure that α and β do not share points?\nStudent：Because parallelism of the lines only ensures the planes are in the same direction, but not that they are a fixed distance apart everywhere—they could overlap or intersect.\nTeacher：You correctly noted that parallel lines in α to β ensure direction alignment, but not positional separation. However, if two intersecting lines in α are parallel to β, what does this say about the possibility of α and β overlapping?\nStudent：If α and β have two intersecting lines in α parallel to β, then α and β could coincide entirely, meaning they are the same plane, not just parallel and distinct.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that two intersecting lines in α being parallel to β could imply α and β coincide. However, this suggests that option B does not ensure strict parallelism (i.e., distinct planes). What is the key difference between planes being parallel and coinciding?\nStudent：The key difference is that parallel planes never intersect and are not the same plane, while coinciding planes are exactly the same in every aspect and share all points.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that coinciding planes are not considered parallel in the strict sense. However, what does this imply about the sufficiency of option B for ensuring $\\alpha // \\beta$?\nStudent：Option B is not strictly sufficient, because the planes could coincide instead of being distinct and parallel.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that option B does not strictly ensure parallelism, as the planes could coincide. What about option A? Does having infinitely many lines in α parallel to β guarantee that α and β are parallel?\nStudent：If there are infinitely many lines in α parallel to β, it means the entire plane α shares the same direction with β, but they could still overlap; so it's not sufficient.\nTeacher：You correctly noted that infinitely many parallel lines in α to β do not guarantee strict parallelism, as the planes could coincide. What does this suggest about the sufficiency of option A?\nStudent：It suggests that option A is also not strictly sufficient for parallelism, because the planes could coincide.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that options A and B are not strictly sufficient for parallelism. What about option C? What does it mean for two planes to be parallel to the same line?",
