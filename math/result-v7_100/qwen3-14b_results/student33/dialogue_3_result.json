    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Let $AB = x$, $AC = \\sqrt{2}x$, and $AD = \\sqrt{2}$.  \nFrom Law of Cosines on $\\triangle ABD$:  \n$BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot AD \\cdot \\cos 135^\\circ$  \nSo, $BD^2 = x^2 + 2 - 2x\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\cos 135^\\circ$.\nTeacher：What is the value of $\\cos 135^\\circ$?\nStudent：$\\cos 135^\\circ = -\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nTeacher：Substitute $-\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ into your equation for $\\cos 135^\\circ$. What does the term $-2x\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\cos 135^\\circ$ become?\nStudent：$-2x\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\left(-\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = 2x$.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified the cosine term, but did you apply the Law of Cosines correctly? What is the correct formula for $BD^2$ in $\\triangle ABD$?\nStudent：Yes, I applied: $BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot AD \\cdot \\cos 135^\\circ$.\nTeacher：You applied the Law of Cosines correctly, but did you consider the triangle configuration? Is $\\angle ADB$ the included angle between $AB$ and $AD$?\nStudent：Since $\\triangle ABD$, $\\angle ADB$ is the angle between $AB$ and $AD$. So yes, it's the included angle.\nTeacher：Your reasoning about the included angle is correct, but you have misapplied the Law of Cosines. The formula should involve sides adjacent to the angle. What are the two sides forming the included angle $\\angle ADB$?\nStudent：The two sides forming the included angle $\\angle ADB$ are $AB$ and $AD$.\nTeacher：You are correct that $AB$ and $AD$ form the included angle, but in the Law of Cosines, the angle is between the two sides that are adjacent to the side being calculated. In this case, $\\angle ADB$ is between $BD$ and $AD$, not $AB$ and $AD$. What is the correct pair of sides adjacent to $\\angle ADB$?\nStudent：The sides adjacent to $\\angle ADB$ are $AD$ and $BD$.\nTeacher：You are correct that $AD$ and $BD$ are adjacent to $\\angle ADB$. However, in the Law of Cosines, you need the two sides that form the angle and are not the side you are solving for. Since you are solving for $BD$, you should use the sides $AB$ and $AD$, which are not adjacent to $\\angle ADB$. What is the correct formula for $BD^2$ using the Law of Cosines with the correct sides and angle?\nStudent：$BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot AD \\cdot \\cos \\angle BAD$.\nTeacher：You have misidentified the angle in the Law of Cosines. The angle $\\angle ADB$ is not $\\angle BAD$. What is the relationship between $\\angle ADB$ and the sides $AB$, $AD$, and $BD$?\nStudent：$\\angle ADB$ is the angle opposite to side $AB$ in $\\triangle ABD$, with sides $AD$ and $BD$ adjacent to it.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $\\angle ADB$ is opposite to side $AB$, but the Law of Cosines requires the angle between the two sides you are using. Since you are solving for $BD$, you should use the angle between $AD$ and $BD$, not $AB$. What is the correct angle to use in the Law of Cosines for this triangle?\nStudent：The correct angle to use is the angle opposite $BD$, which is $\\angle BAD$.\nTeacher：You are confusing the angle opposite $BD$ with the angle between the sides you're using. The Law of Cosines requires the angle between the two sides you're using to calculate the third side. What is the angle between $AD$ and $BD$?\nStudent：The angle between $AD$ and $BD$ is $\\angle ADB$, which is $135^\\circ$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the angle between $AD$ and $BD$ as $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$. However, in your initial application of the Law of Cosines, you incorrectly used this angle with sides $AB$ and $AD$, rather than with sides $AD$ and $BD$. What is the correct formula for $BD^2$ using the Law of Cosines with the correct sides and angle?\nStudent：$BD^2 = AD^2 + AB^2 - 2 \\cdot AD \\cdot AB \\cdot \\cos \\angle BAD$.\nTeacher：You have not corrected the sides used in the Law of Cosines. The correct formula should involve sides $AD$ and $BD$ with the included angle $\\angle ADB$. What is the correct expression for $BD^2$?\nStudent：$BD^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 - 2 \\cdot AD \\cdot BD \\cdot \\cos \\angle ADB$.\nTeacher：This equation is incorrect because it includes $BD^2$ on both sides. What is the correct formula for $BD^2$ using sides $AD$, $BD$, and the included angle $\\angle ADB$?\nStudent：The correct formula is $AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 - 2 \\cdot AD \\cdot BD \\cdot \\cos \\angle ADB$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the sides and angle, but you applied the Law of Cosines to the wrong side. The formula should solve for $BD^2$, not $AB^2$. What is the correct formula for $BD^2$?\nStudent：The correct formula is $BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot AD \\cdot \\cos \\angle BAD$.\nTeacher：You have still not used the correct angle. The Law of Cosines for side $BD$ requires the included angle between $AD$ and $BD$, which is $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$. What is the correct formula for $BD^2$?\nStudent：$BD^2 = AD^2 + AB^2 - 2 \\cdot AD \\cdot AB \\cdot \\cos 135^\\circ$\nTeacher：You have misapplied the Law of Cosines by using sides $AD$ and $AB$ with angle $\\angle ADB$. What are the correct two sides adjacent to $\\angle ADB$?\nStudent：The two sides adjacent to $\\angle ADB$ are $AD$ and $BD$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the sides adjacent to $\\angle ADB$, but you must use these sides in your Law of Cosines formula. What is the correct expression for $BD^2$ using sides $AD$, $BD$, and angle $\\angle ADB$?\nStudent：$AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 - 2 \\cdot AD \\cdot BD \\cdot \\cos 135^\\circ$\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the sides and angle, but you are solving for $BD^2$, not $AB^2$. What is the correct formula for $BD^2$ using sides $AD$, $BD$, and angle $\\angle ADB$?\nStudent：$BD^2 = AD^2 + AB^2 - 2 \\cdot AD \\cdot AB \\cdot \\cos \\angle BAD$\nTeacher：You have not used the correct sides or angle. What is the correct formula for $BD^2$ using sides $AD$, $BD$, and the included angle $\\angle ADB$?\nStudent：$BD^2 = AD^2 + AB^2 - 2 \\cdot AD \\cdot AB \\cdot \\cos \\angle BAD$\nTeacher：You have not used the correct sides or angle. What is the correct formula for $BD^2$ using sides $AD$, $BD$, and the included angle $\\angle ADB$?",
