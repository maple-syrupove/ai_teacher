    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：2\nTeacher：What is the relationship between $|z_1 + z_2|$ and $|z_1 - z_2|$ when $|z_1| = |z_2|$?\nStudent：If $|z_1| = |z_2|$, then $|z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 2(|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2)$.\nTeacher：You mentioned a formula. Did you apply it correctly to find $|z_1 - z_2|$?\nStudent：I used that formula, but I only put in $|z_1|=|z_2|=2$ and $|z_1 - z_2|=2$ as a typical value.\nTeacher：You assumed $|z_1 - z_2| = 2$ without calculating it. What is $|z_1 + z_2|$ given in the problem?\nStudent：$|z_1 + z_2| = |\\sqrt{3} + i|$.\nTeacher：What is the value of $|z_1 + z_2|$?\nStudent：$|\\sqrt{3} + i| = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{3 + 1} = 2$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $|z_1 + z_2| = 2$. Now, use the formula you mentioned to find $|z_1 - z_2|$. What is $|z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2$ equal to?\nStudent：$|z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 2(2^2 + 2^2) = 2(4 + 4) = 16$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly substituted $|z_1 + z_2|^2$ into the formula. What is the correct value of $|z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2$ based on the given values?\nStudent：$|z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 4 + |z_1 - z_2|^2$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified $|z_1 + z_2|^2 = 4$, but you didn't complete the calculation. What is the full expression for $|z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2$?\nStudent：The full expression is $|z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 2(|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2)$.\nTeacher：You correctly recalled the formula, but you didn't substitute the known values to solve for $|z_1 - z_2|$. What is $2(|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2)$?\nStudent：$2(|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2) = 2(4 + 4) = 16$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated $2(|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2) = 16$. Since $|z_1 + z_2|^2 = 4$, what does this imply about $|z_1 - z_2|^2$?\nStudent：This implies $|z_1 - z_2|^2 = 16 - 4 = 12$.\nTeacher：You correctly found $|z_1 - z_2|^2 = 12$. What is $|z_1 - z_2|$?\nStudent：$|z_1 - z_2| = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\nTeacher：Your final answer is correct. You identified the error in your initial assumption and properly applied the formula to find $|z_1 - z_2|$. Well done. zzc\nStudent：zzc",
