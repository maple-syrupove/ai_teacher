    "question": "17. The sides opposite to the interior angles A, B, C of $\\triangle ABC$ are $a, b, c$ respectively. Given that $\\cos ^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+A\\right)+\\cos A=\\frac{5}{4}$.\n\n(1) Find the measure of angle A.\n\n(2) If $b-c=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} a$, prove that $\\triangle A B C$ is a right-angled triangle.\n",
    "correct_answer": "【Solution】\n(1) We are given the equation $\\cos^2(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+A) + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$.\nUsing the co-function identity $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+A) = -\\sin A$, the equation becomes:\n$(-\\sin A)^2 + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$\n$\\sin^2 A + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$.\nUsing the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2 A = 1 - \\cos^2 A$:\n$(1 - \\cos^2 A) + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$.\nRearrange into a standard quadratic form in terms of $\\cos A$:\n$\\cos^2 A - \\cos A + \\frac{5}{4} - 1 = 0$\n$\\cos^2 A - \\cos A + \\frac{1}{4} = 0$.\nThis is a perfect square trinomial: $(\\cos A - \\frac{1}{2})^2 = 0$.\nThis gives $\\cos A = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince A is an angle in a triangle, $0 < A < \\pi$. The angle A for which $\\cos A = 1/2$ is $A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\n(2) From part (1), we have $A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, so $\\cos A = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFrom the Law of Cosines, we know $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A$.\nSubstituting $\\cos A = 1/2$, we get $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc(\\frac{1}{2})$, which simplifies to:\n$a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$ (Equation 1).\n\nWe are given the condition $b-c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}a$. We can write this as $a = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3}}(b-c) = \\sqrt{3}(b-c)$.\nNow, substitute this expression for $a$ into Equation 1:\n$(\\sqrt{3}(b-c))^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$\n$3(b-c)^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$\n$3(b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = b^2 + c^2 - bc$\n$3b^2 - 6bc + 3c^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$\n$2b^2 - 5bc + 2c^2 = 0$.\n\nThis is a quadratic-like equation in terms of b and c. We can factor it. Divide by $c^2$ (assuming $c\\neq 0$):\n$2(\\frac{b}{c})^2 - 5(\\frac{b}{c}) + 2 = 0$.\nLet $x = b/c$. The equation is $2x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0$. \nFactoring gives $(2x-1)(x-2)=0$.\nSo, $x = 1/2$ or $x=2$. This means $\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{1}{2}$ (i.e., $c=2b$) or $\\frac{b}{c} = 2$ (i.e., $b=2c$).\n\nLet's check these with the condition $b-c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}a > 0$ (since a, b, c are side lengths, and if $b=c$, $a=0$, which is impossible). So $b>c$. This means we must have $b=2c$.\n\nNow we have the relationship between the three sides: $b=2c$. Let's find $a$ in terms of $c$.\n$a = \\sqrt{3}(b-c) = \\sqrt{3}(2c-c) = \\sqrt{3}c$.\nSo, the sides are $a=\\sqrt{3}c$, $b=2c$, and $c$.\n\nLet's check if they satisfy the Pythagorean theorem:\n$a^2 + c^2 = (\\sqrt{3}c)^2 + c^2 = 3c^2 + c^2 = 4c^2$.\n$b^2 = (2c)^2 = 4c^2$.\nSince $a^2 + c^2 = b^2$, the triangle is a right-angled triangle, with the right angle at B.\nTherefore, $\\triangle ABC$ is a right-angled triangle.",
