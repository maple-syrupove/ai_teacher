    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：The minimum is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and the maximum is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. So my answer is A.\nTeacher：What is the derivative of $ f(x) $?\nStudent：The derivative is $f'(x) = -\\sin x + (x+1)\\cos x + \\sin x$.\nTeacher：Simplify $ f'(x) $. What do you get?\nStudent：After simplification, $f'(x) = (x+1)\\cos x$.\nTeacher：You simplified $ f'(x) $ correctly. What critical points does this derivative give you on $[0, 2\\pi]$?\nStudent：The critical points are where $(x+1)\\cos x=0$. So, either $x+1=0$ or $\\cos x=0$. On $[0,2\\pi]$, $x=-1$ (not in interval) and $x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：You identified the critical points correctly. What are the function values at these critical points and the endpoints of the interval?\nStudent：At $x=0$, $f(0)=1+1=2$.\n\nAt $x=2\\pi$, $f(2\\pi)=1+2\\pi+1=2\\pi+2$.\n\nAt $x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $f(\\frac{\\pi}{2})=0+(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+1)\\cdot1+1=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2$.\n\nAt $x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, $f(\\frac{3\\pi}{2})=0+(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}+1)\\cdot(-1)+1=-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}-1+1=-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.\n\nSo, the function values are $2$, $2\\pi+2$, $\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2$, and $-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated the function values. What is the maximum value among these?\nStudent：The maximum value is $2\\pi+2$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated the function values. What is the maximum value among these?\nStudent：The maximum value is $2\\pi+2$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the maximum value as $2\\pi + 2$, but your initial answer was A. What is the minimum value?\nStudent：The minimum value is $-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the minimum value as $-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. Why did you initially choose option A?\nStudent：I used the formula for the max/min of $A\\sin x+B\\cos x$, substituting $A=1$, $B=1$, and ignored the $(x+1)$ term.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied a formula meant for constant coefficients to a function with variable coefficients. Why did you assume the formula applies here?\nStudent：I thought that since it looked similar to $A\\sin x+B\\cos x$, I could just use the formula without considering if the coefficients were constants.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied a formula for constant coefficients to a function with variable coefficients. Why did you assume the formula applies here?\nStudent：I thought I could use the familiar formula because the function had $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$ terms, and I didn't pay attention to the $(x+1)$ being variable.\nTeacher：You mistakenly applied a formula for constant coefficients to a function with variable coefficients. What is the correct answer based on your calculations?\nStudent：The correct answer is D. The minimum is $-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, and the maximum is $2\\pi+2$.\nTeacher：Your initial answer was incorrect because you applied a formula meant for constant coefficients to a function with variable coefficients. You correctly calculated the minimum and maximum values as $-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ and $2\\pi + 2$, respectively. What option corresponds to these values?\nStudent：The correct option is D.\nTeacher：Your initial answer was incorrect because you applied a formula meant for constant coefficients to a function with variable coefficients.
