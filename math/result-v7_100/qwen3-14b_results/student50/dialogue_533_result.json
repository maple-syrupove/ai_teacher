    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $y= \\pm x$\nTeacher：What is the relationship between the eccentricity and the asymptotes of a hyperbola?\nStudent：The eccentricity is related to the values of $a$ and $b$, which also determine the slopes of the asymptotes.\nTeacher：How did you determine the slopes of the asymptotes based on the given eccentricity?\nStudent：I didn't use the given eccentricity; I just chose the answer based on memory of the standard form.\nTeacher：You selected an answer without using the provided eccentricity value. This means your choice was not based on the specific information given in the problem. What is the formula for the eccentricity of a hyperbola?\nStudent：The formula is $e = \\sqrt{1+\\frac{b^2}{a^2}}$ for the hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$.\nTeacher：You correctly recalled the formula for eccentricity, but you did not use it to find the relationship between $a$ and $b$. This is the error in your approach. What is the next step after finding the relationship between $a$ and $b$?\nStudent：The next step is to use the relationship to solve for the ratio $\\frac{b}{a}$, which will give me the slope of the asymptotes.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the next step, but you did not apply it. What is the ratio of $b$ to $a$ based on the given eccentricity?\nStudent：Given $e = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$: \n$e = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{b^2}{a^2}}$, so  \n$\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{b^2}{a^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. \n\nSquaring both sides:\n$1 + \\frac{b^2}{a^2} = \\frac{5}{4}$.\n\n$\\frac{b^2}{a^2} = \\frac{5}{4} - 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated the ratio $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{2}$. What is the formula for the slopes of the asymptotes of this hyperbola?\nStudent：The slopes of the asymptotes are $\\pm \\frac{b}{a}$, so the equations are $y = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}x$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated the slopes of the asymptotes as $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$. Your initial answer was incorrect because you did not use the given eccentricity to find this ratio. The correct answer is D. $y = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}x$. Please confirm with \"zzc.\"\nStudent：zzc",
