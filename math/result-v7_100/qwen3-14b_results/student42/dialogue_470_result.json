    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$S_6 = 2a_6 + 1$\nTeacher：What is the relationship between $S_n$ and $a_n$?\nStudent：The relationship given is $S_n=2a_n+1$.\nTeacher：You have used the formula $S_n = 2a_n + 1$ directly for $n=6$, but this formula relates the sum of the first $n$ terms to the $n$-th term, not the sum itself. What is $a_6$ in terms of $S_6$ and $S_5$?\nStudent：$a_6$ can be written as $a_6 = S_6 - S_5$.\nTeacher：Correct. How can you use this to express $S_6$ in terms of $S_5$?\nStudent：We know $a_6 = S_6 - S_5$, so $S_6 = 2a_6 + 1 = 2(S_6 - S_5) + 1$.\nTeacher：You have substituted $a_6$ into the equation for $S_6$, but this leads to an equation involving $S_6$ on both sides. What is the next step to solve for $S_6$?\nStudent：I would collect the $S_6$ terms on one side: $S_6 = 2(S_6 - S_5) + 1 \\implies S_6 = 2S_6 - 2S_5 + 1$. Then, I would rearrange it.\nTeacher：You have correctly expanded the equation. What is the result after moving all $S_6$ terms to one side?\nStudent：$S_6 - 2S_6 = -2S_5 + 1$, so $-S_6 = -2S_5 + 1$.\nTeacher：You have rearranged the equation correctly. What is the expression for $S_6$ in terms of $S_5$?\nStudent：$S_6 = 2S_5 - 1$\nTeacher：You have derived $S_6 = 2S_5 - 1$, but you have not used the original relationship $S_n = 2a_n + 1$ for $n=5$ to find $S_5$. What is $S_5$ in terms of $a_5$?\nStudent：$S_5 = 2a_5 + 1$\nTeacher：Correct. How can you express $a_5$ in terms of $S_5$ and $S_4$?\nStudent：$a_5 = S_5 - S_4$\nTeacher：You have expressed $a_5$ correctly as $S_5 - S_4$. How can you use this to find an expression for $S_5$ in terms of $S_4$?\nStudent：$S_5 = 2(S_5 - S_4) + 1$\nTeacher：You have substituted $a_5$ into the equation for $S_5$, but this leads to an equation involving $S_5$ on both sides. What is the next step to solve for $S_5$?\nStudent：I would collect the $S_5$ terms on one side: $S_5 = 2S_5 - 2S_4 + 1$, then rearrange it.\nTeacher：You have correctly expanded the equation. What is the result after moving all $S_5$ terms to one side?\nStudent：$S_5 - 2S_5 = -2S_4 + 1$, so $-S_5 = -2S_4 + 1$.\nTeacher：You have rearranged the equation correctly. What is the expression for $S_5$ in terms of $S_4$?\nStudent：$S_5 = 2S_4 - 1$\nTeacher：You have derived a recursive relationship, but you haven't used the initial condition to start the recursion. What is $S_1$ in terms of $a_1$?\nStudent：$S_1 = 2a_1 + 1$\nTeacher：You have correctly stated $S_1 = 2a_1 + 1$, but you haven't recognized that $S_1 = a_1$. What is the value of $S_1$?\nStudent：$S_1 = a_1$\nTeacher：Correct. How does this help you find $a_1$?\nStudent：Since $S_1 = a_1$ and also $S_1 = 2a_1 + 1$, I can set $a_1 = 2a_1 + 1$.\nTeacher：You have correctly set up the equation $a_1 = 2a_1 + 1$. What is the solution to this equation?\nStudent：$a_1 = -1$\nTeacher：You have found $a_1 = -1$, but you have not used this to find $S_1$. What is the value of $S_1$?\nStudent：$S_1 = -1$\nTeacher：Correct. Now that you have $S_1 = -1$, use the recursive relationship $S_n = 2S_{n-1} - 1$ to find $S_2$, then $S_3$, and so on up to $S_6$. What is $S_2$?\nStudent：Using $S_2 = 2S_1 - 1$, we get $S_2 = 2 \\times (-1) - 1 = -3$.\nTeacher：Correct. What is $S_3$?\nStudent：$S_3 = 2S_2 - 1 = 2 \\times (-3) - 1 = -7$\nTeacher：Correct. What is $S_4$?",
    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: 0\nSocratic Method: 2\nAdherence to Rules: 1\n\nThe teacher did not correctly identify the student's strategic error of not deriving the recurrence relation using both $S_n=2a_n+1$ and $S_{n-1}=2a_{n-1}+1$, as the dialogue does not show the student responding with \"zzc\". The teacher effectively used Socratic questioning to guide the student through the process without giving direct answers, but continued to guide the student toward the correct answer, which slightly deviates from the rule of only identifying the mistake.",
