    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D.\nTeacher：The condition in D states that two planes are perpendicular to the same plane. However, this does not guarantee that the planes themselves are parallel. What is the relationship between planes that are perpendicular to the same plane?\nStudent：If two planes are both perpendicular to the same plane, it only means they are both orthogonal to that plane, but they are not necessarily parallel to each other.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that D is not a sufficient condition. What do you think about the condition in B?\nStudent：If there are two intersecting lines in α that are parallel to β, then α and β must be parallel planes.\nTeacher：You are correct that two intersecting lines in α being parallel to β implies α and β are parallel. However, this is not the necessary and sufficient condition for α // β. What is the difference between a necessary and sufficient condition?\nStudent：A necessary and sufficient condition means that the statement is true if and only if that condition holds; it works both ways.\nTeacher：You are correct in understanding the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions. Let's consider the definition of parallel planes: two planes are parallel if they do not intersect. How does the condition in B ensure that α and β do not intersect?\nStudent：Since two intersecting lines in α are both parallel to β, this means the entire plane α is parallel to β, so α and β do not intersect.\nTeacher：You have correctly reasoned that the condition in B ensures α and β do not intersect. However, the question asks for a **necessary and sufficient** condition. Is there a scenario where two planes are parallel but do not satisfy the condition in B?\nStudent：If two planes are parallel, it's always possible to find two intersecting lines in one plane that are also parallel to the other plane. So, I think the condition in B always holds if the planes are parallel.\nTeacher：You have correctly reasoned that the condition in B is both necessary and sufficient. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\nStudent：Understood, thank you.\nTeacher：You are welcome. I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\nStudent：I chose D.\nTeacher：The condition in D states that two planes are perpendicular to the same plane. However, this does not guarantee that the planes themselves are parallel.

Is there a scenario where two planes are parallel but do not satisfy the condition in B?\nStudent：If the two planes are parallel, we can always find two intersecting lines in one plane that are parallel to the other plane, so the condition in B always holds.\nTeacher：You have correctly reasoned that the condition in B is both necessary and sufficient.
