    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：\\(\\tan\\alpha = \\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\\)\nTeacher：Your approach incorrectly assumes that $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}$ implies $\\tan\\alpha = \\tan(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4})$. This is a misapplication of the tangent addition formula. What is the correct relationship between $\\tan(\\alpha - \\beta)$ and $\\tan\\alpha$?\nStudent：The correct relationship is: \\(\\tan(\\alpha - \\beta) = \\frac{\\tan\\alpha - \\tan\\beta}{1 + \\tan\\alpha\\tan\\beta}\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly recalled the tangent subtraction formula. However, you have not applied it properly. The formula relates $\\tan(\\alpha - \\beta)$ to $\\tan\\alpha$ and $\\tan\\beta$, but you have not used the given value $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}$ to solve for $\\tan\\alpha$. What is the value of $\\tan\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)$?\nStudent：The value is \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $\\tan\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1$. Now, apply the tangent subtraction formula with $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\tan\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1$. What is the resulting equation for $\\tan\\alpha$?\nStudent：Using the formula: \\(\\frac{\\tan\\alpha - 1}{1 + \\tan\\alpha \\cdot 1} = \\frac{1}{5}\\).\nTeacher：You have set up the equation correctly. Now solve for $\\tan\\alpha$. What is the next step in solving $\\frac{\\tan\\alpha - 1}{1 + \\tan\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{5}$?\nStudent：Next, I would cross-multiply: \\(5(\\tan\\alpha - 1) = 1 + \\tan\\alpha\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly cross-multiplied. Now simplify the equation $5(\\tan\\alpha - 1) = 1 + \\tan\\alpha$. What is the simplified form of this equation?\nStudent：\\(5\\tan\\alpha - 5 = 1 + \\tan\\alpha\\)\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the equation. Now solve for $\\tan\\alpha$. What is the value of $\\tan\\alpha$?\nStudent：\\(5\\tan\\alpha - \\tan\\alpha = 1 + 5\\)\n\nSo, \\(4\\tan\\alpha = 6\\).\n\nThus, \\(\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly solved the equation and found $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$. However, this answer is incorrect. What step in your calculation might have led to an error?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You have correctly solved the algebraic equation, but you have not considered the periodicity and possible quadrant restrictions of the tangent function. What is the period of the tangent function?\nStudent：The period of the tangent function is \\(\\pi\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the period of the tangent function. However, the error lies in assuming that the solution $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$ is unique without considering the original equation's domain. What is the general solution for $\\tan\\alpha$?\nStudent：The general solution is \\(\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}\\), and since tangent has period \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) + k\\pi\\), \\(k\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the general solution, but the question specifically asks for $\\tan\\alpha$, not $\\alpha$. The value $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$ is correct based on the algebraic manipulation. However, this does not account for the periodicity and potential quadrant restrictions implied by the original equation. What is the value of $\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ in terms of its quadrant?\nStudent：\\(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) could be in any quadrant because the tangent function is periodic and repeats every \\(\\pi\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly noted that $\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ can be in any quadrant. However, the mistake lies in not considering that $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}$ implies a specific quadrant for $\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$, which affects the value of $\\tan\\alpha$. What is the sign of $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4})$?\nStudent：The sign of \\(\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4})\\) is positive, since \\(\\frac{1}{5}>0\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the sign of $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4})$. However, the mistake lies in not considering that a positive tangent value implies the angle $\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ could be in either the first or third quadrant, which affects the value of $\\tan\\alpha$. What is the correct range for $\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ based on the given information?\nStudent：The correct range is the first or third quadrant, so \\(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) is in \\((0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\) or \\((\\pi, \\frac{3\\pi}{2})\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the possible quadrants for $\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$. However, the mistake lies in not considering that the original equation involves a specific angle shift, which restricts the possible values of $\\alpha$ and thus affects the quadrant of $\\alpha$. What is the value of $\\alpha$ in terms of $\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$?\nStudent：\\(\\alpha = (\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\)\nTeacher：You have correctly expressed $\\alpha$ in terms of $\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$. However, the mistake lies in not considering that adding $\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ to an angle in the first or third quadrant can result in different quadrants for $\\alpha$, which affects the sign of $\\tan\\alpha$. What is the correct value of $\\tan\\alpha$ based on the quadrant of $\\alpha$?\nStudent：The sign of $\\tan\\alpha$ will depend on where $\\alpha$ ends up after adding $\\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ to the reference angle. If $\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4})$ is positive, then $\\tan\\alpha$ could also be positive or negative depending on that final quadrant. I didn't analyze that when finding $\\tan\\alpha$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that the sign of $\\tan\\alpha$ depends on its quadrant. However, the mistake lies in not recognizing that the value $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$ is valid only if $\\alpha$ lies in a quadrant where tangent is positive, which may not necessarily align with the original equation's constraints. What is the final value of $\\tan\\alpha$ based on your calculations?\nStudent：The final value I calculated was \\(\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$, but this value does not satisfy the original equation $\\tan\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}$. The mistake lies in not verifying your solution against the original equation.\nStudent：I see. I didn't check if my answer for $\\tan\\alpha$ makes $\\tan\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the mistake: you did not verify your solution by plugging $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$ back into the original equation $\\tan\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}$. This step is crucial to confirm the validity of your answer.\nStudent：zzc",
