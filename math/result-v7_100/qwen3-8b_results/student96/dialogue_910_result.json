    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is $-\\frac{1}{6}$.\nTeacher：The tangent line's equation is derived from the derivative of $ f(x) $. Did you compute the derivative correctly?\nStudent：Yes, I computed the derivative at $x=0$ and got $f'(0) = -\\frac{1}{3}$.\nTeacher：The tangent line equation is $ y = f(0) + f'(0)x $. Did you use the correct point of tangency?\nStudent：Yes, I used the point $(0,1)$ for the tangent line.\nTeacher：The tangent line equation is $ y = 1 - \\frac{1}{3}x $. Did you find the x- and y-intercepts correctly?\nStudent：Yes, I found the x-intercept as $x=3$ and the y-intercept as $y=1$.\nTeacher：The x-intercept is at $x=3$, and the y-intercept is at $y=1$. Did you calculate the area of the triangle formed by these intercepts and the coordinate axes correctly?\nStudent：I used the formula $S=\\frac{1}{2}ab$, and substituted $a=1$ and $b=-\\frac{1}{3}$, so I got $-\\frac{1}{6}$.\nTeacher：The formula for the area of a triangle is $ S = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} $. Did you use the absolute values of the intercepts?\nStudent：No, I didn't use the absolute values. I just used $a=1$ and $b=-\\frac{1}{3}$.\nTeacher：You should use the absolute values of the intercepts when calculating the area, as area is a positive quantity.\nStudent：zzc",
