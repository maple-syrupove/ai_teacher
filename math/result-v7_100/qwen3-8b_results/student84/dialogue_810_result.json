    "question": "18. A student interest group randomly investigated the daily air quality level and the number of people exercising in a certain park for 100 days in a certain city. The data is organized into the table below (unit: days):\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}\n\\hline $\\begin{array}{l}\\text{Number of People} \\\\\n\\text{Air Quality Level}\\end{array}$ & {$[0,200]$} & $(200,400]$ & $(400,600]$ \\\\\n\\hline 1 (Excellent) & 2 & 16 & 25 \\\\\n\\hline 2 (Good) & 5 & 10 & 12 \\\\\n\\hline 3 (Light Pollution) & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline 4 (Moderate Pollution) & 7 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(1) Estimate the respective probabilities that the city's daily air quality level is 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n(2) Find the estimated average number of people exercising in the park per day (use the midpoint of each group interval as the representative value).\n\n(3) If the air quality level on a certain day is 1 or 2, it is called a \"good air quality\" day. If the level is 3 or 4, it is called a \"poor air quality\" day. Based on the given data, complete the following $2 \\times 2$ contingency table, and based on the table, determine if there is 95% confidence to believe that the number of people exercising in the park is related to the city's air quality on that day.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\n\\hline & People $\\leq 400$ & People $>400$ \\\\\n\\hline Good Air Quality & & \\\\\n\\hline Poor Air Quality & & \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nAppendix: $\\quad K^{2}=\\frac{n(a d-b c)^{2}}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)}$,\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}\n\\hline$P\\left(K^{2} \\geq k\\right)$ & 0.050 & 0.010 & 0.001 \\\\\n\\hline$k$ & 3.841 & 6.635 & 10.828 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n",
    "correct_answer": "【Solution】\n(1) The total number of days surveyed is 100.\nNumber of days with level 1 quality = $2+16+25 = 43$. Probability P(Level 1) = $\\frac{43}{100} = 0.43$.\nNumber of days with level 2 quality = $5+10+12 = 27$. Probability P(Level 2) = $\\frac{27}{100} = 0.27$.\nNumber of days with level 3 quality = $6+7+8 = 21$. Probability P(Level 3) = $\\frac{21}{100} = 0.21$.\nNumber of days with level 4 quality = $7+2+0 = 9$. Probability P(Level 4) = $\\frac{9}{100} = 0.09$.\n\n(2) We use the midpoints of the intervals for the number of people: 100 for $[0,200]$, 300 for $(200,400]$, and 500 for $(400,600]$.\nThe total number of people for each interval is:\n- $[0,200]$: $2+5+6+7 = 20$ days.- $(200,400]$: $16+10+7+2 = 35$ days.- $(400,600]$: $25+12+8+0 = 45$ days.The estimated average number of people is:\n$\\bar{x} = \\frac{100 \\times 20 + 300 \\times 35 + 500 \\times 45}{100} = \\frac{2000 + 10500 + 22500}{100} = \\frac{35000}{100} = 350$ people.\n\n(3) We need to fill the $2 \\times 2$ contingency table.\n\"Good Air Quality\" corresponds to levels 1 and 2.\n\"Poor Air Quality\" corresponds to levels 3 and 4.\n\"People $\\leq 400$\" corresponds to the first two columns of the number of people.\n\"People $> 400$\" corresponds to the last column.\n\n- Good Air Quality & People $\\leq 400$: $(2+16) + (5+10) = 18 + 15 = 33$.\n- Good Air Quality & People $> 400$: $25 + 12 = 37$.\n- Poor Air Quality & People $\\leq 400$: $(6+7) + (7+2) = 13 + 9 = 22$.\n- Poor Air Quality & People $> 400$: $8 + 0 = 8$.\n\nThe completed $2 \\times 2$ table is:\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}\n\\hline & People $\\leq 400$ & People $>400$ & Total \\\\\n\\hline Good Air Quality & 33 & 37 & 70 \\\\\n\\hline Poor Air Quality & 22 & 8 & 30 \\\\\n\\hline Total & 55 & 45 & 100 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nNow we calculate the $K^2$ statistic: $a=33, b=37, c=22, d=8, n=100$.\n$K^2 = \\frac{n(ad-bc)^2}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)} = \\frac{100(33 \\times 8 - 37 \\times 22)^2}{(70)(30)(55)(45)}$\n$K^2 = \\frac{100(264 - 814)^2}{5197500} = \\frac{100(-550)^2}{5197500} = \\frac{100(302500)}{5197500} = \\frac{30250000}{5197500} \\approx 5.820$.\n\nFor 95% confidence, the significance level is $\\alpha=0.05$. From the appendix, the critical value is $k=3.841$.\nSince our calculated value $K^2 \\approx 5.820 > 3.841$, we reject the null hypothesis of independence.\nTherefore, there is 95% confidence to believe that the number of people exercising in the park is related to the city's air quality on that day.",

The \"People > 400\" column should include only days where the number of people exercising is in the interval (400, 600]. You incorrectly summed all days for each air quality level.\nStudent：Understood. So for “Good Air Quality” and “People ≤ 400”, I should add the counts from air quality levels 1 and 2 in the [0,200] and (200,400] columns. That is, (2+16) + (5+10) = 33.\nTeacher：For “Good Air Quality” and “People > 400”, you should add the counts from air quality levels 1 and 2 in the (400, 600] column.
