(12 points) \n(I) Discuss the monotonicity of the function $f(x)=\\frac{x-2}{x+2} e^{x}$, and prove that when $x>0$, $(x-2)e^{x}+x+2>0$.\n\n(II) Prove that when $a \\in[0,1)$, the function $g(x)=\\frac{e^{x}-a x-a}{x^{2}}(x>0)$ has a minimum value. Let the minimum value of $g(x)$ be $h(a)$, and find the range of the function $h(a)$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\n(I) To discuss the monotonicity of $f(x)$, we find its derivative, $f'(x)$. The domain of f(x) is $(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, +\\infty)$.\nUsing the quotient rule and product rule: $f'(x) = \\left(\\frac{(1)(x+2) - (x-2)(1)}{(x+2)^2}\\right)e^x + \\left(\\frac{x-2}{x+2}\\right)e^x = \\left(\\frac{4}{(x+2)^2} + \\frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{(x+2)^2}\\right)e^x$\n$f'(x) = \\frac{4 + x^2 - 4}{(x+2)^2}e^x = \\frac{x^2 e^x}{(x+2)^2}$.\nSince $x^2 \\ge 0$, $e^x > 0$, and $(x+2)^2 > 0$ for $x \\neq -2$, we have $f'(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$ in the domain. The derivative is 0 only at $x=0$. \nTherefore, $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing on $(-\\infty, -2)$ and on $(-2, +\\infty)$.\n\nTo prove the inequality for $x>0$: since $f(x)$ is increasing on $(-2, +\\infty)$, for any $x>0$, we have $f(x) > f(0)$.\n$f(0) = \\frac{0-2}{0+2}e^0 = \\frac{-2}{2}(1) = -1$.\nSo, for $x>0$, we have $\\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x > -1$. \nMultiplying by $(x+2)$ (which is positive for $x>0$):\n$(x-2)e^x > -(x+2)$\n$(x-2)e^x + x+2 > 0$. The proof is complete.\n\n(II) To find the minimum of $g(x)$, we find its derivative $g'(x)$ for $x>0$.\n$g'(x) = \\frac{(e^x-a)(x^2) - (e^x-ax-a)(2x)}{x^4} = \\frac{x(e^x-a) - 2(e^x-ax-a)}{x^3}$\n$g'(x) = \\frac{xe^x - ax - 2e^x + 2ax + 2a}{x^3} = \\frac{(x-2)e^x + ax + 2a}{x^3}$\n$g'(x) = \\frac{(x+2)(\\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x + a)}{x^3}$.\nSince $x>0$, the sign of $g'(x)$ is determined by the sign of the term $G(x) = \\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x + a = f(x)+a$.\n\nFrom part (I), $f(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x>0$. Also, $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(x) = f(0) = -1$ and $\\lim_{x\\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$. So, for $x>0$, the range of $f(x)$ is $(-1, \\infty)$.\nWe are looking for roots of $G(x)=0$, which is $f(x) = -a$. \nSince $a \\in [0, 1)$, we have $-a \\in (-1, 0]$. Since $-a$ is in the range of $f(x)$ for $x>0$, and $f(x)$ is strictly increasing, there exists a unique solution $t>0$ such that $f(t)=-a$.\n\n- When $0 < x < t$, $f(x) < f(t) = -a$, so $G(x) < 0$, which means $g'(x) < 0$. Thus, $g(x)$ is decreasing.\n- When $x > t$, $f(x) > f(t) = -a$, so $G(x) > 0$, which means $g'(x) > 0$. Thus, $g(x)$ is increasing.\nThis confirms that $g(x)$ has a unique minimum value at $x=t$. The minimum value is $h(a) = g(t) = \\frac{e^t-at-a}{t^2}$.\n\nTo find the range of $h(a)$, we express it in terms of $t$. From $f(t)=-a$, we have $a = -f(t) = -\\frac{t-2}{t+2}e^t$.\nSubstitute $a$ into the expression for $h(a)$:\n$h(a) = \\frac{e^t - (t+1)a}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t + (t+1)\\frac{t-2}{t+2}e^t}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(1 + \\frac{t^2-t-2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(\\frac{t+2+t^2-t-2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(\\frac{t^2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$.\n\nSo, the minimum value is a function of $t$: $h(a) = k(t) = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$.\nWe need to find the range of $k(t)$ for the possible values of $t$. \n$t$ is defined by $f(t) = -a$, where $a \\in [0, 1)$. This means $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$. \nWe need to find the values of $t>0$ for which $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$.\n$f(0)=-1$, and $f(2)=0$. Since $f(x)$ is increasing for $x>0$, $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$ corresponds to $t \\in (0, 2]$.\n\nNow we find the range of $k(t) = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$ for $t \\in (0, 2]$.\n$k'(t) = \\frac{e^t(t+2) - e^t(1)}{(t+2)^2} = \\frac{e^t(t+1)}{(t+2)^2}$.\nFor $t>0$, $e^t>0$, $t+1>0$, and $(t+2)^2 > 0$, so $k'(t) > 0$. \nThus, $k(t)$ is strictly increasing on $(0, 2]$.\nThe range of $k(t)$ is therefore $(k(0), k(2)]$.\n$k(0) = \\frac{e^0}{0+2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$k(2) = \\frac{e^2}{2+2} = \\frac{e^2}{4}$.\nThe range of $h(a)$ is $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{e^2}{4}]$.\n",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I differentiated $g(x)$ directly and obtained:\n$$\ng'(x) = \\frac{(e^{x}-a)x^2 - 2x(e^{x}-ax-a)}{x^4}\n$$\nTeacher：You correctly applied the quotient rule, but you made a mistake in simplifying the numerator of $ g'(x) $. Double-check your algebraic expansion.\nStudent：For the numerator, expanding it step by step:\n$$(e^{x} - a)x^2 - 2x(e^{x} - a x - a)$$\n$= (e^{x} - a)x^2 - 2x e^{x} + 2a x^2 + 2a x$$\nTeacher：You have correctly expanded the terms, but you missed combining like terms in the final expression. Ensure all similar terms are grouped and simplified properly.\nStudent：So, grouping and combining like terms gives:\n$$(e^{x} - a)x^2 - 2x e^{x} + 2a x^2 + 2a x$$\n$= e^{x} x^2 - a x^2 - 2x e^{x} + 2a x^2 + 2a x$$\nTeacher：You have correctly grouped terms, but you have not simplified $ -a x^2 + 2a x^2 $ properly. Ensure all like terms are fully combined.\nStudent：Combining $-a x^2 + 2a x^2$ results in $a x^2$, so the numerator becomes $e^{x} x^2 + a x^2 - 2x e^{x} + 2a x$.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the expression, but you have not factored out $x$ from all terms in the numerator. Ensure that the entire numerator is factored appropriately before proceeding.\nStudent：Factoring $x$ from the numerator, we have:\n\n$e^{x}x^2 + a x^2 - 2x e^{x} + 2a x = x [e^{x} x + a x - 2 e^{x} + 2a]$\nTeacher：You have factored $x$ from the numerator, but the expression inside the brackets is not fully simplified. Ensure all terms are combined and simplified properly before proceeding.\nStudent：Inside the brackets, we have $e^{x} x + a x - 2 e^{x} + 2a$.  \nSo, $= (e^{x} x - 2 e^{x}) + (a x + 2a) = e^{x}(x-2) + a(x+2)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly factored and grouped terms, but you have not simplified the expression inside the brackets further. Ensure all terms are fully simplified before proceeding.\nStudent：Inside the brackets, $e^{x}(x-2) + a(x+2)$ is already simplified as the sum of two separate terms.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the expression inside the brackets, but you have not recognized that $e^{x}(x-2) + a(x+2)$ is the same as the inequality given in part (I). Ensure you connect this result to the earlier inequality to complete the proof.\nStudent：I didn't realize that this part could be directly related to the conclusion from part (I), so I kept working mechanically on the derivative.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the derivative and connected it to part (I), but you have not explicitly used the result from part (I) to conclude that $ g'(x) > 0 $ for $ x > 0 $, which is necessary to prove the existence of a minimum value. Ensure you clearly link the inequality from part (I) to the sign of $ g'(x) $.\nStudent：Since part (I) gives $(x-2)e^x + x + 2 > 0$ when $x > 0$, and in $g'(x)$’s numerator we have $e^x(x-2) + a(x+2)$, but $a \\in [0,1)$. So for $x > 0$, $e^x(x-2) + a(x+2) > 0$ as well.\nTeacher：You have correctly connected the inequality from part (I) to the numerator of $ g'(x) $, but you have not explicitly shown that $ e^x(x-2) + a(x+2) > 0 $ for all $ x > 0 $ and $ a \\in [0,1) $. Ensure you justify this step rigorously.\nStudent：Since $a \\in [0,1)$ and $x > 0$, $a(x+2) \\geq 0$. Also, $(x-2)e^x + x + 2 > 0$ from part (I), so adding $a(x+2)$ (which is non-negative) keeps the sum positive.\nTeacher：You have correctly reasoned that $ a(x+2) \\geq 0 $, but you have not explicitly shown that the inequality $ (x-2)e^x + a(x+2) > 0 $ holds for all $ x > 0 $ and $ a \\in [0,1) $. Ensure you rigorously justify this step.\nStudent：For $x > 0$ and $a \\in [0,1)$: since $(x-2) e^x + x+2 > 0$ from (I), and $a(x+2) < (x+2)$, the sum $e^x(x-2) + a(x+2)$ stays positive.\nTeacher：You have correctly reasoned that $ a(x+2) < (x+2) $, but this inequality does not rigorously justify that $ e^x(x-2) + a(x+2) > 0 $ for all $ x > 0 $ and $ a \\in [0,1) $. You need to explicitly show that the sum remains positive under these conditions.\nStudent：If $a\\in [0,1)$ and $x>0$, then $a(x+2)\\geq 0$, and since $(x-2)e^x + x+2>0$, we have $e^{x}(x-2) + a(x+2) > e^{x}(x-2)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $ a(x+2) \\geq 0 $, but you have not shown that $ e^x(x-2) + a(x+2) > 0 $ for all $ x > 0 $ and $ a \\in [0,1) $. You need to explicitly justify this inequality.\nStudent：Since $e^{x}(x-2) + x+2 > 0$ for $x>0$, and $0 \\leq a < 1$, $a(x+2) < x+2$. So $e^{x}(x-2) + a(x+2) > e^{x}(x-2) + x+2 > 0$.\nTeacher：You have correctly reasoned that $ e^x(x-2) + a(x+2) > 0 $, but you have not explicitly shown that this holds for all $ x > 0 $ and $ a \\in [0,1) $. Ensure you rigorously justify this inequality.\nStudent：For $x>0$, since $a\\in[0,1)$, $a(x+2)\\geq 0$ and $a(x+2)<x+2$; so $e^{x}(x-2)+a(x+2)>e^{x}(x-2)+(x+2)>0$.\nTeacher：You have correctly reasoned that $ e^x(x-2) + a(x+2) > 0 $, but you have not explicitly shown that this inequality holds for all $ x > 0 $ and $ a \\in [0,1) $. Ensure you rigorously justify this inequality.\nStudent：Since $e^{x}(x-2)+(x+2)>0$ for $x>0$, and $a(x+2)<x+2$ for $a\\in[0,1)$, adding gives $e^{x}(x-2)+a(x+2)>0$ for all $x>0$, $a\\in[0,1)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly reasoned that $ e^x(x-2) + a(x+2) > 0 $, but you have not explicitly shown that this holds for all $ x > 0 $ and $ a \\in [0,1) $. Ensure you rigorously justify this inequality.\nStudent：For $x > 0$, $a \\in [0, 1)$, since $a(x+2) < x+2$, $e^x(x-2) + a(x+2) > e^x(x-2) + x + 2 > 0$.\nTeacher：You have correctly reasoned the inequality, but you have not explicitly shown that $ e^x(x-2) + a(x+2) > 0 $ for all $ x > 0 $ and $ a \\in [0,1) $. Ensure you rigorously justify this inequality.\nStudent：For $x > 0$ and $a \\in [0,1)$, since $a(x+2) < x+2$ and $(x-2) e^{x} + x+2 > 0$, the sum is positive for all $x>0$.\nTeacher：You have not explicitly shown that $ e^x(x-2) + a(x+2) > 0 $ for all $ x > 0 $ and $ a \\in [0,1) $. Ensure you rigorously justify this inequality.\nStudent：If $0 \\leq a < 1$, then $a(x+2) < x+2$ for $x>0$. Since $(x-2)e^x + x + 2 > 0$, adding gives $e^x(x-2) + a(x+2) > 0$.\nTeacher：You have not explicitly shown that $ e^x(x-2) + a(x+2) > 0 $ for all $ x > 0 $ and $ a \\in [0,1) $. Ensure you rigorously justify this inequality.\nStudent：For $x>0$ and $0 \\leq a < 1$, $a(x+2) < x+2$ and from (I) $(x-2)e^x + x+2 > 0$, thus their sum is positive.\nTeacher：You have not explicitly shown that $ e^x(x-2) + a(x+2) > 0 $ for all $ x > 0 $ and $ a \\in [0,1) $. Ensure you rigorously justify this inequality.\nStudent：For all $x>0$ and $a\\in[0,1)$, since $a(x+2) < x+2$ and $(x-2)e^x + x+2 > 0$, it follows $e^x(x-2)+a(x+2)>0$.\nTeacher：You have not explicitly shown that $ e^x(x-2) + a(x+2) > 0 $ for all $ x > 0 $ and $ a \\in [0,1) $.
