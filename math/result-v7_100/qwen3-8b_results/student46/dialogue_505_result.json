    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$m = \\dfrac{1}{2}$\nTeacher：The asymptotes of the hyperbola are $y = \\pm \\frac{x}{m}$. Did you correctly identify the equations of the asymptotes?\nStudent：Yes, I used $y = \\pm \\frac{x}{m}$ as the equations of the asymptotes.\nTeacher：The next step is to find the equations of the asymptotes and then determine their distance from the center of the circle. Did you calculate the distance from the center of the circle to the asymptotes?\nStudent：I calculated the distance from (0,0) to the lines $y = \\pm\\frac{x}{m}$.\nTeacher：The center of the circle is not (0,0). Did you correctly identify the center of the circle $x^2 + y^2 - 4y + 3 = 0$?\nStudent：I thought the center was at (0,0).\nTeacher：You incorrectly identified the center of the circle. The center of the circle $x^2 + y^2 - 4y + 3 = 0$ is not $(0,0)$. Did you complete the square to find the correct center?\nStudent：No, I did not complete the square to find the center.\nTeacher：The center of the circle is at (0, 2). Did you use this correct center when calculating the distance from the asymptotes?\nStudent：No, I did not use (0, 2) as the center in my calculation.\nTeacher：You used the wrong center when calculating the distance from the asymptotes to the circle's center.
