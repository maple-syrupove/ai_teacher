    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose B. $b > a > c$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that $ \\cos \\frac{1}{4} $ is greater than $ \\frac{31}{32} $. Is this assumption correct?\nStudent：I calculated $\\cos \\frac{1}{4}$ to be slightly more than $\\frac{31}{32}$ with my calculator, so I thought it was correct.\nTeacher：Your calculation of $ \\cos \\frac{1}{4} $ is incorrect. The value of $ \\cos x $ decreases as $ x $ increases for $ x \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}) $. Since $ \\frac{1}{4} $ radians is approximately $ 0.25 $, which is less than $ \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\approx 0.785 $, you should compare $ \\cos \\frac{1}{4} $ to $ \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.707 $. Is $ \\cos \\frac{1}{4} $ greater than $ \\frac{31}{32} \\approx 0.96875 $?\nStudent：No, $\\cos \\frac{1}{4}$ is less than $\\frac{31}{32}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $ \\cos \\frac{1}{4} < \\frac{31}{32} $. However, you still assumed $ b > a $, which is incorrect. Let’s now compare $ a $ and $ c $. Is $ \\sin \\frac{1}{4} $ greater than $ \\frac{31}{128} $?\nStudent：No, $\\sin \\frac{1}{4}$ is less than $\\frac{31}{128}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $ \\sin \\frac{1}{4} < \\frac{31}{128} $, but this does not directly help in comparing $ a $ and $ c $. Let’s instead consider the relationship between $ \\sin x $ and $ x $ for small $ x $. Is $ \\sin x < x $ for $ x > 0 $?\nStudent：Yes, for $x > 0$, $\\sin x < x$.\nTeacher：You have correctly noted that $ \\sin x < x $ for $ x > 0 $. Therefore, $ \\sin \\frac{1}{4} < \\frac{1}{4} $, which implies $ c = 4 \\sin \\frac{1}{4} < 1 $. Since $ a = \\frac{31}{32} \\approx 0.96875 $, and $ c < 1 $, you must reconsider the relationship between $ a $ and $ c $. Is $ c > a $ or $ c < a $?\nStudent：$c < a$.\nTeacher：You have correctly determined that $ c < a $. However, you still assumed $ b > a $, which is incorrect. Therefore, your choice of B is wrong.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：Your initial assumption that $ b > a $ was incorrect. The correct order is $ a > b > c $.\nStudent：Alright, I see. So the correct answer should be C. $a > b > c$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the error in your initial assumption about $ b > a $. The correct order is indeed $ a > b > c $, so the correct answer is C.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the error in your initial assumption about $ b > a $. The correct order is indeed $ a > b > c $, so the correct answer is C.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the error in your initial assumption about $ b > a $.
