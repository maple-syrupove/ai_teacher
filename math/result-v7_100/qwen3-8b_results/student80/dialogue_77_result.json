    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I used the vertex $(2,0)$, so the distance is $d = \\frac{|2-8|}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{5}}$.\nTeacher：You used the vertex instead of the focus. What is the formula for the coordinates of the foci of a hyperbola?\nStudent：The coordinates of the foci for the hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ are $(\\pm c, 0)$, where $c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the foci formula, but did not compute $ c $. What is the value of $ c $ for this hyperbola?\nStudent：For this hyperbola, $a^2 = 4$ and $b^2 = 5$, so $c = \\sqrt{4+5} = 3$.\nTeacher：Teacher：You correctly found $ c = 3 $. What are the coordinates of the right focus?\nStudent：The right focus has coordinates $(3, 0)$.\nTeacher：You have the coordinates of the right focus as $(3, 0)$. Now calculate the distance from this point to the line $x + 2y - 8 = 0$. What formula do you use for the distance from a point to a line?\nStudent：The formula is $d = \\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}$, where the line is $Ax + By + C = 0$.\nTeacher：You have the correct formula, but substituted incorrectly. What is the value of $ |Ax_0 + By_0 + C| $ for the point $(3, 0)$ and the line $x + 2y - 8 = 0$?\nStudent：It is $|3 + 2 \\times 0 - 8| = |-5| = 5$.\nTeacher：You correctly calculated the numerator as 5, but the denominator should be $\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5}$. Therefore, the distance is $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{5}}$, not $\\frac{6}{\\sqrt{5}}$.\nStudent：Oh, I see. So the correct distance should be $d = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\sqrt{5}$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the error and arrived at the correct final answer. The mistake was using the vertex instead of the focus in your initial calculation. Well done.\nStudent：zzc",
