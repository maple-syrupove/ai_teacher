    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option C, $c<a<b$.\nTeacher：Let's analyze the values step by step. What is the approximate value of $ a = \\log_2 0.2 $?\nStudent：$a = \\log_2 0.2 \\approx -2.32$\nTeacher：Let's examine $ b = 2^{0.2} $. What is the approximate value of $ b $?\nStudent：$b = 2^{0.2} \\approx 1.15$\nTeacher：Let's consider $ c = 0.2^{0.3} $. What is the approximate value of $ c $?\nStudent：$c = 0.2^{0.3} \\approx 0.617$\nTeacher：Let's compare the approximate values: $ a \\approx -2.32 $, $ b \\approx 1.15 $, and $ c \\approx 0.617 $. What is the correct order of these values?\nStudent：The correct order should be $a < c < b$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the approximate values and their order. However, your initial choice was option C ($c < a < b$), which is inconsistent with the correct order $a < c < b$. Therefore, your mistake was selecting the wrong option based on the correct ordering.\nStudent：That's not quite right. I didn't order them correctly at first; I misjudged $c$'s magnitude.\nTeacher：Your mistake was misjudging the magnitude of $ c = 0.2^{0.3} $. You incorrectly placed $ c $ between $ a $ and $ b $, but in reality, $ c $ is greater than $ a $ but less than $ b $.\nStudent：Yes, I thought $c$ was greater than 1 at first and thus made the wrong judgment.\nTeacher：Your mistake was initially misjudging the magnitude of $ c = 0.2^{0.3} $, thinking it was greater than 1, which led to an incorrect ordering.\nStudent：zzc",
