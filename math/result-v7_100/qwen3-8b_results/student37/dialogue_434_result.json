    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Cannot be determined.\nTeacher：The problem provides sufficient information to determine a unique value for $ t $. What assumption are you making that leads you to conclude it cannot be determined?\nStudent：I thought that after expanding the dot product, there were too many variables and $t$ couldn't be isolated, so I concluded it couldn't be determined.\nTeacher：You assumed there are too many variables, but in this case, all vectors are unit vectors with a known angle between them. This provides enough information to express the dot product in terms of $ t $ and solve for it. What specific step did you take when expanding $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} $?\nStudent：I wrote $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = t(\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a}) + (1-t)(\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{b})$.\nTeacher：That is correct. Now, what is the value of $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} $?\nStudent：The value of $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{b}$ is $1$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 1 $, but you did not use the known angle between $ \\vec{a} $ and $ \\vec{b} $ to find $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} $. What is the value of $ \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} $?\nStudent：The value of $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a}$ is $\\cos 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：You have all the necessary components to solve for $ t $. What is the equation you formed using these values?\nStudent：The equation I wrote is $t \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (1-t) \\cdot 1 = 0$.\nTeacher：You correctly formed the equation, but you made a mistake in simplifying it. Let's examine your algebraic steps.\nStudent：I expanded it to $t \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 - t = 0$, then got stuck because I thought $t$ could not be isolated.\nTeacher：You incorrectly simplified the expression. Let's combine like terms properly. What is $ \\frac{1}{2}t - t $?\nStudent：$\\frac{1}{2}t - t = -\\frac{1}{2}t$.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified $ \\frac{1}{2}t - t $ to $ -\\frac{1}{2}t $. Now, what is the remaining term in the equation?\nStudent：The remaining term is $+1$ from the $(1-t)\\cdot1$ expansion.\nTeacher：You now have the equation $ -\\frac{1}{2}t + 1 = 0 $. What is the next step in solving for $ t $?\nStudent：The next step is to subtract $1$ from both sides to get $-\\frac{1}{2}t = -1$.\nTeacher：Then, multiply both sides by $-2$ to solve for $t$. What is the final value of $t$?\nStudent：The final value of $t$ is $2$.\nTeacher：You correctly solved for $ t $ and found $ t = 2 $. However, the mistake was in your initial assumption that $ t $ could not be isolated. The equation simplifies cleanly to a unique solution. Your final answer is correct.\nStudent：Thank you, I understand now.\nTeacher：You initially assumed that $ t $ could not be isolated due to the complexity of the equation, but in reality, the equation simplifies cleanly to a unique solution. Your final answer is correct.\nStudent：zzc",
