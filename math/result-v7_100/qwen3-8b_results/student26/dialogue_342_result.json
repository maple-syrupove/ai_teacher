    "question": "17. (12 points) Given that $\\{a_{n}\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3. The sequence $\\{b_{n}\\}$ satisfies $b_{1}=1, b_{2}=\\frac{1}{3}$, and $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$.\n\n(I) Find the general term formula for $\\{a_{n}\\}$.\n\n(II) Find the sum of the first $n$ terms of $\\{b_{n}\\}$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\n(I) We are given the recurrence relation $a_{n} b_{n+1}+b_{n+1}=n b_{n}$, which can be factored as $(a_n+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\nLet's use the given values for $n=1$ to find $a_1$.\nFor $n=1$: $(a_1+1)b_2 = 1 \\cdot b_1$.\nWe are given $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n$(a_1+1)(\\frac{1}{3}) = 1$.\n$a_1+1 = 3$.\n$a_1 = 2$.\n\nWe are told that $\\{a_n\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $d=3$. \nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$a_n = 2 + (n-1)3 = 2 + 3n - 3 = 3n - 1$.\n\n(II) Now we need to find the sum of the first n terms of $\\{b_n\\}$. First, let's find a general formula for $\\{b_n\\}$.\nFrom part (I), we know $a_n = 3n-1$. Substitute this into the recurrence relation $(a_n+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\n$((3n-1)+1)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\n$(3n)b_{n+1} = nb_n$.\nFor $n \\ge 1$, we can divide by $n$:\n$3b_{n+1} = b_n$.\nThis can be rewritten as $\\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThis shows that $\\{b_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with a common ratio $q = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nWe are given the first term $b_1 = 1$.\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula $S_n = \\frac{b_1(1-q^n)}{1-q}$.\n$S_n = \\frac{1(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n)}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{3}{2}(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^n) = \\frac{3}{2}(1 - 3^{-n})$.\nThis can also be written as $\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot 3^n} = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^{n-1}}$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：(I) $a_n = a_1 + 3(n-1)$\n\n(II) I cannot find a general term for $b_n$, so I cannot provide the required sum.\nTeacher：Your general term for $\\{a_n\\}$ is correct. However, you did not use the given recurrence relation involving $\\{b_n\\}$ to find $b_n$, which is necessary for part (II). How did you approach finding $b_n$?\nStudent：I looked at the initial values $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$ and tried to spot a pattern, but I couldn't find one.\nTeacher：You assumed that finding a pattern from initial terms alone would suffice, but the recurrence relation provides a critical relationship between terms of $\\{b_n\\}$ that must be used to derive its general form. How did you interpret the recurrence $a_n b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = n b_n$?\nStudent：I saw the recurrence, but I mainly focused on the values of $b_1$ and $b_2$ and didn’t try substituting $a_n$ into the equation.\nTeacher：You failed to substitute the general term of $\\{a_n\\}$ into the recurrence relation, which is essential for deriving a relationship involving $b_n$. What happens when you substitute $a_n = a_1 + 3(n-1)$ into the recurrence?\nStudent：If I substitute $a_n = a_1 + 3(n-1)$, the recurrence becomes $(a_1 + 3(n-1))b_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = n b_n$.\nTeacher：You correctly substituted the general term of $\\{a_n\\}$, but you did not simplify or rearrange the equation to express $b_{n+1}$ in terms of $b_n$, which is necessary to find a pattern or recurrence for $\\{b_n\\}$. What is the simplified form of the equation?\nStudent：The equation simplifies to $(a_1 + 3(n-1) + 1)b_{n+1} = n b_n$, so $b_{n+1} = \\frac{n b_n}{a_1 + 3(n-1) + 1}$.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified the equation, but you did not substitute the specific value of $a_1$, which is required to fully determine the recurrence for $\\{b_n\\}$. What is the value of $a_1$?\nStudent：$a_1$ is just $a_1$; the problem doesn’t give a specific value for $a_1$.\nTeacher：You have not realized that $a_1$ can be determined using the given recurrence relation and initial conditions. How can you find $a_1$?\nStudent：I can use the equation for $n=1$: $a_1 b_2 + b_2 = 1 \\cdot b_1$. Plugging in $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$ gives $a_1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 1$.\nTeacher：You correctly used the recurrence for $n=1$ to find $a_1$, but you did not solve the equation. What is the value of $a_1$?\nStudent：Solving $a_1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 1$ gives $a_1 = 2$.\nTeacher：You have correctly determined that $a_1 = 2$. However, you did not use this value to fully simplify the recurrence relation for $\\{b_n\\}$. What is the simplified form of the recurrence for $b_{n+1}$ using $a_1 = 2$?\nStudent：With $a_1 = 2$, the recurrence is $b_{n+1} = \\frac{n b_n}{2 + 3(n-1) + 1} = \\frac{n b_n}{3n} = \\frac{b_n}{3}$.\nTeacher：You correctly simplified the recurrence to $b_{n+1} = \\frac{b_n}{3}$, but you did not recognize that this is a geometric sequence with common ratio $\\frac{1}{3}$. What is the general term for a geometric sequence with first term $b_1 = 1$ and common ratio $\\frac{1}{3}$?\nStudent：The general term is $b_n = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the general term for $\\{b_n\\}$, but you did not use it to compute the sum of the first $n$ terms. What is the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence?\nStudent：The sum is $S_n = b_1 \\cdot \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}$, where $r = \\frac{1}{3}$. So $S_n = \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly derived the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of $\\{b_n\\}$, but you did not simplify it further. What is the simplified form of $S_n = \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}}$?\nStudent：$S_n = \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{3}{2} \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n \\right)$\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the sum formula for $\\{b_n\\}$. However, you did not check whether this formula satisfies the initial conditions or verify its consistency with the recurrence relation. Have you verified your final expression for $S_n$ against the known values of $b_1$ and $b_2$?\nStudent：No, I did not check the formula against the initial values of $b_1$ and $b_2$.\nTeacher：You failed to verify your final expression for the sum $S_n$ against the known values of $b_1$ and $b_2$, which is essential to confirm its correctness.\nStudent：I understand. Next time, I will check the formula using $b_1=1$ and $b_2=\\frac{1}{3}$ to confirm correctness.\nTeacher：You have now identified the key error: you did not verify your final expression for $S_n$ against the known values of $b_1$ and $b_2$. This is essential to confirm the correctness of your solution.\nStudent：That’s not the main reason for my mistake.\nTeacher：You are incorrect. The main reason for your mistake was failing to verify your final expression for $S_n$ against the known values of $b_1$ and $b_2$. This is essential to confirm the correctness of your solution.\nStudent：That’s not the reason for my mistake.\nTeacher：You have not acknowledged that failing to verify your final expression for $S_n$ against the known values of $b_1$ and $b_2$ was the primary error. This is essential to confirm the correctness of your solution.\nStudent：That’s not the reason for my mistake.\nTeacher：You have not acknowledged that failing to verify your final expression for $S_n$ against the known values of $b_1$ and $b_2$ was the primary error.
