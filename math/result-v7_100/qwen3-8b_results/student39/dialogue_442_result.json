Let's begin by considering how to expand $(x-y)(x+y)^8$. What is the general approach to finding the coefficient of a specific term in such an expansion?\nStudent：I tried to expand the entire expression at once, looking for terms like $x^2y^7$. I listed out some terms manually.\nTeacher：What is the degree of the term $x^2 y^7$? How does this relate to the degrees of terms in the expansion of $(x+y)^8$?\nStudent：The degree of $x^2y^7$ is $2+7=9$. In $(x+y)^8$, terms have degree 8.\nTeacher：You correctly noted the degree of $x^2 y^7$ is 9, but the expansion of $(x-y)(x+y)^8$ results in terms of degree 9. However, you have not identified how the multiplication by $(x - y)$ affects the coefficients. What happens when you multiply a term from $(x+y)^8$ by $x$ and $-y$?\nStudent：When you multiply by $x$, the degree of $x$ in each term from $(x+y)^8$ increases by 1. When you multiply by $-y$, the degree of $y$ increases by 1 and the sign changes.\nTeacher：You have not yet considered how to combine these results to find the specific coefficient of $x^2 y^7$. What is the contribution of each part of the multiplication $(x - y)$ to this term?\nStudent：From multiplying by $x$, we get $x(x+y)^8$; from $-y$, we get $-y(x+y)^8$. Each contributes terms with different $x$ and $y$ powers.\nTeacher：To find the coefficient of $x^2 y^7$, you need to determine which terms in $(x+y)^8$ combine with $x$ and $-y$ to produce this term. What is the specific term in $(x+y)^8$ that, when multiplied by $x$, gives $x^2 y^7$?\nStudent：That would be the $x y^7$ term in $(x+y)^8$, since $x \\cdot x y^7 = x^2 y^7$.\nTeacher：What is the coefficient of $x y^7$ in $(x+y)^8$?",
