    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $\\sqrt{5}$\nTeacher：Using the Law of Cosines, find AB. Then use the Law of Sines to find sin B and cos B, then compute tan B. What value did you get for AB?\nStudent：I wasn't able to find the value for AB. I set up the Law of Cosines for side a, but couldn't continue.\nTeacher：Using the Law of Cosines, $ AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 - 2 \\cdot AC \\cdot BC \\cdot \\cos C $. Did you substitute the values correctly?\nStudent：No, I didn't substitute the values for side c. I used the formula for side a instead.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the Law of Cosines by using the formula for side $ a $ instead of side $ c $. Let's clarify: in $ \\triangle ABC $, side $ c $ is opposite angle $ C $, so you should have used $ AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 - 2 \\cdot AC \\cdot BC \\cdot \\cos C $. Did you substitute the values correctly for $ AC $, $ BC $, and $ \\cos C $?\nStudent：No, I didn't substitute the values for those.
