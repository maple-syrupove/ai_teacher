    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to compute $f'(x)$ directly to find the extremes, but the derivative became complicated, and I couldn't get a clear answer for $M + m$.\nTeacher：What did you observe about the behavior of $ f(x) $ as $ x \\to \\infty $ and $ x \\to -\\infty $?\nStudent：As $x \\to \\infty$ or $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ approaches $1$.\nTeacher：That's correct. Now, what did you notice about the function's symmetry?\nStudent：I checked, and I think $f(x)$ doesn’t have even or odd symmetry; but I didn’t fully analyze its structure.\nTeacher：You observed that $ f(x) $ approaches 1 at both infinities, but did you consider whether the function might have a specific symmetry that could simplify finding $ M + m $?\nStudent：I didn’t try to find any specific substitution or symmetry that might help simplify calculating $M + m$. I just tried using derivatives.\nTeacher：You didn’t consider that the function might have a symmetry between $ M $ and $ m $, which could simplify the calculation of $ M + m $. Let me ask: did you check if $ f(x) + f(-x) $ is constant?\nStudent：No, I didn’t check if $f(x) + f(-x)$ is constant.\nTeacher：That is the key mistake. You did not investigate whether $ f(x) + f(-x) $ is constant, which would directly give $ M + m $. Let me know if you'd like to explore this further.\nStudent：zzc",
