    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：The minimum is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and the maximum is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. So the answer is A.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the minimum and maximum values, but you did not account for the constant term \"+1\" in the function. This affects the final result. Let me ask: Did you include the \"+1\" when calculating the extreme values?\nStudent：No, I did not include the \"+1\" when I calculated the maximum and minimum values.\nTeacher：You missed the \"+1\" in the function when determining the extreme values, which shifts both the minimum and maximum by +1. Let me ask: Did you evaluate the function at critical points and endpoints?\nStudent：No, I didn't evaluate the function at the critical points and endpoints.\nTeacher：You did not evaluate the function at critical points and endpoints, which is essential for finding the true minimum and maximum values. Let me ask: Did you find the derivative of the function and solve for critical points?\nStudent：No, I didn't find the derivative or solve for critical points.\nTeacher：You did not find the derivative or solve for critical points, which is essential for identifying potential extrema. Let me ask: Did you recognize that the function involves both trigonometric and polynomial terms, requiring differentiation to locate critical points?\nStudent：No, I treated the function as if it only involved trigonometric terms and did not consider the polynomial part.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that the function contains both trigonometric and polynomial terms, which necessitates differentiation to locate critical points. This oversight led to an incorrect identification of extrema.\nStudent：zzc",
