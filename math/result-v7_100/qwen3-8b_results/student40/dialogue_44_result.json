    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: The diameter of the sphere is 3, so the radius is 1.5. The surface area is $4\\pi r^2 = 9\\pi$.\nTeacher：What is the relationship between the cuboid and the sphere in this problem?\nStudent：All the vertices of the cuboid are lying on the surface of the sphere.\nTeacher：What is the diameter of the sphere in relation to the cuboid?\nStudent：I thought the diameter of the sphere was equal to the length of the cuboid, which is 3.\nTeacher：The diameter of the sphere is not necessarily equal to the length of the cuboid. What is the longest diagonal of the cuboid?\nStudent：The longest diagonal of the cuboid is the space diagonal, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem for three dimensions.\nTeacher：Teacher：What is the formula for the space diagonal of a cuboid with length $ l $, width $ w $, and height $ h $?\nStudent：The formula is $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$.\nTeacher：The space diagonal of the cuboid is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{14}$. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is $\\sqrt{14}$, not 3.\nStudent：zzc",
