Only provide the information necessary to answer the teacher's current question.\n**If the teacher points out your mistake in a statement and this accusation exactly matches the reason in 【Specific Error JSON】, you must respond with the exact string \"zzc\". If the teacher states an error that does not match your actual mistake, you should deny it and wait for the teacher's next question. If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly.

After diagnosing and stating the error, wait for the student's final response.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. 3\nTeacher：Your answer suggests you believe there are only three pairs (x, y) that satisfy the condition. Can you explain how you arrived at this conclusion?\nStudent：I tried different values for $x$ and $y$ from set $A$ and counted the pairs where $x-y$ was also in $A$. I found a few pairs that worked and stopped when I thought I had enough.\nTeacher：Your reasoning seems to stop at a small sample, but you didn't systematically check all possible pairs. Did you consider all combinations of $x$ and $y$ from set $A$?\nStudent：No, I didn't check all combinations. I mainly checked some pairs that first came to mind.\nTeacher：Your error is that you didn't systematically check all possible pairs $(x, y)$ from set $A$. This led to an incomplete and potentially incorrect count of valid pairs.\nStudent：zzc",
