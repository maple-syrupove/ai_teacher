    "question": "20. (12 points) In the Cartesian coordinate system $xOy$, the curve $C: y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}$ intersects the line $l: y=k x+a(a>0)$ at two points M and N.\n\n(I) When $k=0$, find the equations of the tangent lines to C at points M and N respectively.\n\n(II) Does there exist a point P on the y-axis such that for any value of k, we always have $\\angle O P M=\\angle O P N$? (Explain your reasoning)\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution: (I) When $k=0$, the line equation becomes $l: y=a$.\nTo find the intersection points M and N, we solve the system:\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y=a \\\\ y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\end{array}\\right.$\nThis gives $\\frac{x^2}{4} = a$, so $x^2 = 4a$, which means $x = \\pm 2\\sqrt{a}$.\nWithout loss of generality, let $M$ be the point with the positive x-coordinate. So, the coordinates are $M(2 \\sqrt{a}, a)$ and $N(-2 \\sqrt{a}, a)$.\n\nThe derivative of the curve $C: y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}$ is $y' = \\frac{2x}{4} = \\frac{x}{2}$.\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at M is $y'|_{x=2\\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{a}}{2} = \\sqrt{a}$.\nThe equation of the tangent line at M is $y - a = \\sqrt{a}(x - 2\\sqrt{a})$.\n$y - a = \\sqrt{a}x - 2a$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{a}x - y - a = 0$.\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at N is $y'|_{x=-2\\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{-2\\sqrt{a}}{2} = -\\sqrt{a}$.\nThe equation of the tangent line at N is $y - a = -\\sqrt{a}(x - (-2\\sqrt{a}))$.\n$y - a = -\\sqrt{a}x - 2a$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{a}x + y + 3a = 0$. (Note: there is a calculation error in the original Chinese answer for the tangent at N. It should be $y-a = -\\sqrt{a}(x+2\\sqrt{a}) \\implies y-a = -\\sqrt{a}x - 2a \\implies \\sqrt{a}x + y + a = 0$). Let's use the correct one: $\\sqrt{a}x + y + a = 0$.\n\n(II) Yes, such a point exists. The point is $P(0, -a)$.\nLet $P$ be a point $(0, b)$ on the y-axis. Let the intersection points be $M(x_1, y_1)$ and $N(x_2, y_2)$. The condition $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ (where O is the origin) means that the line segment OP (which is on the y-axis) is the angle bisector of $\\angle MPN$. This implies that the angles that PM and PN make with the y-axis are equal. This is equivalent to saying that the slopes of PM and PN are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign (i.e., $k_{PM} = -k_{PN}$, or $k_{PM} + k_{PN} = 0$), assuming M and N are on opposite sides of the y-axis (which they are, as we will see).\n\nLet's find the intersection points by solving the system:\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y=kx+a \\\\ y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\end{array}\\right.$\n$\frac{x^2}{4} = kx+a \\implies x^2 - 4kx - 4a = 0$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum and product of the roots are: $x_1 + x_2 = 4k$ and $x_1x_2 = -4a$.\nSince $a>0$, $x_1x_2$ is negative, meaning one root is positive and one is negative, so M and N are on opposite sides of the y-axis.\n\nThe slopes of PM and PN are $k_{PM} = \\frac{y_1-b}{x_1}$ and $k_{PN} = \\frac{y_2-b}{x_2}$.\nWe require $k_{PM} + k_{PN} = 0$.\n$\\frac{y_1-b}{x_1} + \\frac{y_2-b}{x_2} = 0$\n$\\frac{x_2(y_1-b) + x_1(y_2-b)}{x_1x_2} = 0$\n$x_2y_1 - bx_2 + x_1y_2 - bx_1 = 0$\nSubstitute $y_1 = kx_1+a$ and $y_2 = kx_2+a$:\n$x_2(kx_1+a) - bx_2 + x_1(kx_2+a) - bx_1 = 0$\n$kx_1x_2 + ax_2 - bx_2 + kx_1x_2 + ax_1 - bx_1 = 0$\n$2k(x_1x_2) + (a-b)(x_1+x_2) = 0$\nNow substitute the values from Vieta's formulas:\n$2k(-4a) + (a-b)(4k) = 0$\n$-8ak + 4k(a-b) = 0$\nSince this must hold for any value of $k$, we can divide by $4k$ (assuming $k \neq 0$. If $k=0$, the condition holds trivially as the setup is symmetric).\n$-2a + (a-b) = 0$\n$-a - b = 0$\n$b = -a$\n\nThus, the point P must be $(0, -a)$. This point is independent of $k$. Therefore, such a point exists, and its coordinates are $(0, -a)$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：(II) I set $P(0,b)$, then tried to use geometric properties and the angle bisector condition to establish a relationship, but I couldn't solve for a specific value of $b$.\nTeacher：What condition must hold for $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ to be true for all values of $k$?\nStudent：That would mean that point P must always lie on the angle bisector of $\\angle MON$, where M and N are the intersection points of the line and the curve for any $k$.\nTeacher：What geometric property defines the angle bisector of $\\angle MON$ for any $k$?\nStudent：The angle bisector would be the locus of points equidistant in angle from OM and ON, that is, it splits the angle $\\angle MON$ into two equal parts for varying M and N.\nTeacher：What is the significance of the curve $ C: y = \\frac{x^2}{4} $ in determining the locus of point $ P $?\nStudent：The curve $C$ provides the coordinates of $M$ and $N$ for each $k$, which determines the directions of OM and ON, thus affecting the angle bisector locus for point $P$.\nTeacher：What property of the curve $ C: y = \\frac{x^2}{4} $ ensures that the angle bisector locus for point $ P $ is consistent for all $ k $?\nStudent：I think the symmetry of the curve about the y-axis ensures that for any $k$, the intersection points $M$ and $N$ are symmetric with respect to the y-axis, so the locus might stay consistent.\nTeacher：The symmetry of the curve ensures that for any $k$, points $M$ and $N$ are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Therefore, the angle bisector of $\\angle MON$ must lie on the y-axis. Hence, point $P$ must lie on the y-axis. However, your reasoning did not explicitly conclude that $P$ must be at the origin or another specific point on the y-axis.\nStudent：Yes, I set $P(0, b)$ in my solution but I couldn't determine the specific value for $b$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $ P $ must lie on the y-axis due to the symmetry of the curve. However, you did not establish a condition or equation to determine the specific value of $ b $.\nStudent：Yes, I wasn't able to derive an equation involving $b$ that could be solved, so I got stuck.\nTeacher：You have not utilized the condition that $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ for all $k$, which should lead to a specific geometric or algebraic constraint on $b$.\nStudent：I tried to write an equation for the angle condition directly using geometry, but I ended up with something too complicated to solve for $b$.\nTeacher：You have not considered the reflection property or the specific geometric condition that must hold for the angles $\\angle OPM$ and $\\angle OPN$ to be equal for all $k$. This is the key missing step.\nStudent：I see. I focused mainly on the geometry setup and didn't think to use any properties of the slopes or coefficients relating to $M$ and $N$.\nTeacher：You have not considered the relationship between the slopes of lines $PM$ and $PN$ for the angles $\\angle OPM$ and $\\angle OPN$ to be equal, which is essential for establishing a condition on $b$.\nStudent：Yes, I didn't try to relate the slopes or use their formulas for $PM$ and $PN$; I only tried with a geometric description.\nTeacher：You have not utilized the fact that for $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ to hold for all $k$, the point $P$ must lie on the axis of symmetry of the curve $C$, and specifically, it must satisfy a condition derived from the slopes of lines $PM$ and $PN$.
