    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Let $AB=x$, $AC=\\sqrt{2}x$, $AD=\\sqrt{2}$, $\\angle ADB=135^\\circ$, $BC=3BD$.  \nLet $BD=y$; so $BC=3y$, $DC=2y$.  \nI set up the Law of Cosines at $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle ADC$, but was unable to proceed.\nTeacher：In $\\triangle ABD$, you applied the Law of Cosines but did not account for the correct angle. The angle given is $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$, but you may have used a different angle in your calculation.\nStudent：I used the Law of Cosines with $\\triangle ABD$, plugging in $AB = x$, $AD = \\sqrt{2}$, and $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$, but still had too many unknowns.\nTeacher：In $\\triangle ABD$, you used $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$, but you may have incorrectly associated the angle with the wrong sides in the Law of Cosines formula. The angle is at D, so it should be between sides $AD$ and $BD$. Did you correctly identify which sides correspond to the angle in your calculation?\nStudent：Yes, I used $AD$ and $BD$ as the sides enclosing the $135^\\circ$ angle in $\\triangle ABD$ when applying the Law of Cosines.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the sides enclosing the angle in $\\triangle ABD$, but you did not account for the fact that $\\angle ADC$ is supplementary to $\\angle ADB$, and thus is $45^\\circ$. This affects the Law of Cosines application in $\\triangle ADC$.\nStudent：Thank you, I see. In $\\triangle ADC$, I would then use the $45^\\circ$ angle between $AD$ and $DC$ and use Law of Cosines with $AD=\\sqrt{2}$ and $DC=2y$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the supplementary angle in $\\triangle ADC$, but you did not include $AC = \\sqrt{2}x$ in your Law of Cosines setup for $\\triangle ADC$. This is essential for forming the equation.\nStudent：I set up the Law of Cosines for $\\triangle ADC$ as:  \n$AC^2 = AD^2 + DC^2 - 2 \\cdot AD \\cdot DC \\cdot \\cos 45^\\circ$,  \nso $(\\sqrt{2}x)^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 + (2y)^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}\\cdot 2y \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nTeacher：You correctly applied the Law of Cosines in $\\triangle ADC$, but you did not relate $x$ and $y$ through $\\triangle ABD$, which is necessary to solve for $y$.\nStudent：I wrote the Law of Cosines in $\\triangle ABD$ as $x^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 + y^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}y\\cos 135^\\circ$. I couldn't solve for $y$.\nTeacher：You correctly applied the Law of Cosines in $\\triangle ABD$, but you did not simplify $\\cos 135^\\circ$ properly, which is $-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. This affects the equation's simplification.\nStudent：You're right. \nSo, $x^2 = 2 + y^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}y \\times \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$.  \nThat gives $x^2 = 2 + y^2 + 2y$.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified the equation from $\\triangle ABD$, but you did not substitute this expression for $x^2$ into the equation derived from $\\triangle ADC$. This is necessary to solve for $y$.\nStudent：Oh, I see.  \nSo I still had both $x$ and $y$ in the equation and didn't substitute $x^2 = 2 + y^2 + 2y$ into the $\\triangle ADC$ equation.\nTeacher：You have now identified the key error: you did not substitute the expression for $x^2$ from $\\triangle ABD$ into the equation derived from $\\triangle ADC$. This prevents you from solving for $y$ directly.\nStudent：zzc",
