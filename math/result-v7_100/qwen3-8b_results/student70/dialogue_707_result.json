    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C.\nTeacher：The complement of M in U is {1, 3}. What does this tell you about the elements of M?\nStudent：This means that 1 and 3 are not in M.\nTeacher：The complement of M contains elements not in M. If the complement is {1, 3}, then M must contain the remaining elements of U. What elements are left in U after removing 1 and 3?\nStudent：The remaining elements are 2, 4, and 5.\nTeacher：Therefore, M must be {2, 4, 5}. Which of the options is true based on this?\nStudent：A. $2 \\in M$\nTeacher：The complement of M is {1, 3}, so M contains {2, 4, 5}. Therefore, 2 is in M.
