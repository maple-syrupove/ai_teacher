    "question": "17. (12 points) Given that $a, b, c$ are the sides opposite to the interior angles $A, B, C$ of $\\triangle A B C$ respectively, and they satisfy the equation $\\operatorname{acos} C+\\sqrt{3} a \\sin C-b-c=0$.\n\n(1) Find the measure of angle $A$.\n\n(2) If $a=2$ and the area of $\\triangle A B C$ is $\\sqrt{3}$, find the lengths of sides $b$ and $c$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution: (1) The given equation is $a\\cos C+\\sqrt{3} a \\sin C-b-c=0$.\nRearranging gives $a(\\cos C+\\sqrt{3} \\sin C) = b+c$.\nBy the Law of Sines, we have $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C} = k$ for some constant $k$. \nSo, $a = k\\sin A, b = k\\sin B, c = k\\sin C$. Substitute these into the given equation:\n$k\\sin A \\cos C + \\sqrt{3} k\\sin A \\sin C - k\\sin B - k\\sin C = 0$.\nDividing by $k$ (since $k\\neq 0$):\n$\\sin A \\cos C + \\sqrt{3} \\sin A \\sin C = \\sin B + \\sin C$.\nIn a triangle, $B = 180^{\\circ} - (A+C)$, so $\\sin B = \\sin(180^{\\circ}-(A+C)) = \\sin(A+C)$.\n$\\sin(A+C) = \\sin A \\cos C + \\cos A \\sin C$.\nSubstitute this into the equation:\n$\\sin A \\cos C + \\sqrt{3} \\sin A \\sin C = (\\sin A \\cos C + \\cos A \\sin C) + \\sin C$.\nCancel $\\sin A \\cos C$ from both sides:\n$\\sqrt{3} \\sin A \\sin C = \\cos A \\sin C + \\sin C$.\nSince $C$ is an angle of a triangle, $\\sin C \\neq 0$. We can divide the entire equation by $\\sin C$:\n$\\sqrt{3} \\sin A = \\cos A + 1$.  (Note: Original solution has a calculation error here, it should be $\\sqrt{3}\\sin A \\sin C = \\sin A \\cos C + \\sin C$. The provided answer $\\sin(A-30)=1/2$ comes from $\\sqrt{3} \\sin A - \\cos A = 1$ not $\\sqrt{3} \\sin A = \\cos A + \\sin(A+C)$. Let's re-follow the original solution logic which seems to have skipped a step. The original equation is $\\sin A \\cos C+\\sqrt{3} \\sin A \\sin C=\\sin(A+C)+\\sin C$.  $\\sin A \\cos C+\\sqrt{3} \\sin A \\sin C=\\sin A\\cos C + \\cos A \\sin C +\\sin C$. This simplifies to $\\sqrt{3} \\sin A \\sin C - \\cos A \\sin C - \\sin C = 0$. Factor out $\\sin C$: $\\sin C(\\sqrt{3}\\sin A - \\cos A - 1) = 0$. Since $\\sin C \\neq 0$, we have $\\sqrt{3}\\sin A - \\cos A = 1$. This is the equation the original analysis seems to be solving).\nLet's solve $\\sqrt{3}\\sin A - \\cos A = 1$. \nDivide by $\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{3})^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{3+1}=2$:\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\sin A - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos A = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThis matches the form $\\cos(30^{\\circ})\\sin A - \\sin(30^{\\circ})\\cos A = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nUsing the sine subtraction formula, $\\sin(A-B) = \\sin A \\cos B - \\cos A \\sin B$:\n$\\sin(A - 30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince $A$ is an angle in a triangle, $0^{\\circ} < A < 180^{\\circ}$, so $-30^{\\circ} < A-30^{\\circ} < 150^{\\circ}$.\nThe possible values for $A-30^{\\circ}$ are $30^{\\circ}$ or $150^{\\circ}$.\nIf $A-30^{\\circ} = 30^{\\circ}$, then $A=60^{\\circ}$.\nIf $A-30^{\\circ} = 150^{\\circ}$, then $A=180^{\\circ}$, which is impossible for a triangle.\nTherefore, $A = 60^{\\circ}$.\n\n(2) We are given $a=2$ and the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\sqrt{3}$. We found $A=60^{\\circ}$.\nThe formula for the area of a triangle is Area $= \\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A$.\n$\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin(60^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{2}bc(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}bc$.\nDividing by $\\sqrt{3}$, we get $1 = \\frac{bc}{4}$, so $bc=4$. (1)\n\nNow, use the Law of Cosines:\n$a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A$.\nSubstitute the known values:\n$2^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2(4)\\cos(60^{\\circ})$.\n$4 = b^2 + c^2 - 8(\\frac{1}{2})$.\n$4 = b^2 + c^2 - 4$.\n$b^2 + c^2 = 8$.\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1) $bc=4$\n2) $b^2+c^2=8$\nWe can use the identity $(b+c)^2 = b^2+c^2+2bc$. \n$(b+c)^2 = 8 + 2(4) = 16$.\nSo, $b+c = 4$ (since side lengths must be positive).\n\nWe need to find two numbers whose sum is 4 and whose product is 4. These numbers are the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - (sum)x + (product) = 0$.\n$x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0$.\n$(x-2)^2 = 0$.\nThe only solution is $x=2$. Therefore, $b=c=2$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：The answer is: Since $a=2$ and area $=\\sqrt{3}$, we have $bc\\sin A = 4\\sqrt{3}$. Using the Law of Sines, $\\frac{a}{\\sin A}=\\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}$, but with only $a$ and area given, there are infinite $(b,c)$ pairs possible. The answer is not unique.\nTeacher：Your reasoning is partially correct, but you have overlooked the fact that angle $A$ is fixed based on the given equation.
