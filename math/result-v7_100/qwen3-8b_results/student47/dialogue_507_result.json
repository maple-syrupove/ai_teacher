    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. $[0,2]$\nTeacher：Your answer includes all real numbers between 0 and 2, but the intersection of sets A and B must consist of elements that are in both sets. Set A contains real numbers, while set B contains integers. Therefore, your answer is incorrect because it includes non-integer values. What is the correct set of integers that satisfy both conditions?\nStudent：$\\{0,1,2\\}$\nTeacher：D. $\\{0,1,2\\}$ is correct. However, you have not considered that set $B$ includes all integers $x$ such that $\\sqrt{x} \\leqslant 4$, which means $x \\leqslant 16$. Therefore, your answer is incomplete. What integers satisfy both $|x| \\leqslant 2$ and $\\sqrt{x} \\leqslant 4$?\nStudent：The integers that satisfy both conditions are $-2, -1, 0, 1, 2$.\nTeacher：Your answer includes negative integers, but set $B$ is defined as $\\{x \\in Z \\mid \\sqrt{x} \\leqslant 4\\}$, which requires $x \\geq 0$ since the square root of a negative number is not real.
