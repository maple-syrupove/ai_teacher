    "question": "17. The sides opposite to the interior angles A, B, C of $\\triangle ABC$ are $a, b, c$ respectively. Suppose $(\\sin B-\\sin C)^{2}=\\sin ^{2} A-\\sin B \\sin C$.\n\n(1) Find the measure of angle A.\n\n(2) If $\\sqrt{2} a+b=2 c$, find $\\sin C$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "【Detailed Explanation】(1) We are given the equation $(\\sin B-\\sin C)^{2}=\\sin ^{2} A-\\sin B \\sin C$.\nExpand the left side:\n$\\sin^2 B - 2\\sin B \\sin C + \\sin^2 C = \\sin^2 A - \\sin B \\sin C$.\nRearrange the terms to group the squares on one side:\n$\\sin^2 B + \\sin^2 C - \\sin^2 A = 2\\sin B \\sin C - \\sin B \\sin C$\n$\\sin^2 B + \\sin^2 C - \\sin^2 A = \\sin B \\sin C$.\n\nBy the Law of Sines, $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C} = k$. So, $\\sin A = a/k, \\sin B = b/k, \\sin C = c/k$.\nSubstitute these into the equation:\n$(b/k)^2 + (c/k)^2 - (a/k)^2 = (b/k)(c/k)$.\nMultiply the entire equation by $k^2$:\n$b^2 + c^2 - a^2 = bc$.\n\nFrom the Law of Cosines, we know that $\\cos A = \\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}$.\nSubstitute the result we just found:\n$\\cos A = \\frac{bc}{2bc} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince A is an angle in a triangle, $A \\in (0, \\pi)$. The angle A for which $\\cos A = 1/2$ is $A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\n(2) We are given $\\sqrt{2} a+b=2 c$. Using the Law of Sines again, this becomes:\n$\\sqrt{2}k\\sin A + k\\sin B = 2k\\sin C$.\n$\\sqrt{2}\\sin A + \\sin B = 2\\sin C$.\nWe know $A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and $B = \\pi - (A+C) = \\pi - (\\frac{\\pi}{3}+C)$.\nSo, $\\sin B = \\sin(\\pi - (\\frac{\\pi}{3}+C)) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}+C) = \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\cos C + \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\sin C = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos C + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin C$.\n\nSubstitute $\\sin A = \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and the expression for $\\sin B$ into the equation:\n$\\sqrt{2}(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos C + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin C) = 2\\sin C$.\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos C = 2\\sin C - \\frac{1}{2}\\sin C = \\frac{3}{2}\\sin C$.\nMultiply by 2: $\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{3}\\cos C = 3\\sin C$.\n$3\\sin C - \\sqrt{3}\\cos C = \\sqrt{6}$.\n\nWe can solve this using the R-formula, $R\\sin(C-\\alpha)$. Here $R = \\sqrt{3^2 + (-\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{9+3} = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n$2\\sqrt{3}(\\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\sin C - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\cos C) = \\sqrt{6}$.\n$2\\sqrt{3}(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\sin C - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos C) = \\sqrt{6}$.\n$2\\sqrt{3}\\sin(C - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\sqrt{6}$.\n$\\sin(C - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\nSince $A=\\frac{\\pi}{3}$, we have $0 < C < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, so $-\\frac{\\pi}{6} < C-\\frac{\\pi}{6} < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nIn this range, the only solution to $\\sin(C - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ is $C - \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n$C = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{3\\pi+2\\pi}{12} = \\frac{5\\pi}{12}$.\n\nWe need to find $\\sin C = \\sin(\\frac{5\\pi}{12})$.\n$\\sin(\\frac{5\\pi}{12}) = \\sin(75^{\\circ}) = \\sin(45^{\\circ}+30^{\\circ}) = \\sin 45^{\\circ}\\cos 30^{\\circ} + \\cos 45^{\\circ}\\sin 30^{\\circ}$\n$= \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{4}$.",
