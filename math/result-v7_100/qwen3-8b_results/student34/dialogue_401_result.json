Given that $\\cos ^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+A\\right)+\\cos A=\\frac{5}{4}$.\n\n(1) Find the measure of angle A.\n\n(2) If $b-c=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} a$, prove that $\\triangle A B C$ is a right-angled triangle.\n",
    "correct_answer": "【Solution】\n(1) We are given the equation $\\cos^2(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+A) + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$.\nUsing the co-function identity $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+A) = -\\sin A$, the equation becomes:\n$(-\\sin A)^2 + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$\n$\\sin^2 A + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$.\nUsing the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2 A = 1 - \\cos^2 A$:\n$(1 - \\cos^2 A) + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$.\nRearrange into a standard quadratic form in terms of $\\cos A$:\n$\\cos^2 A - \\cos A + \\frac{5}{4} - 1 = 0$\n$\\cos^2 A - \\cos A + \\frac{1}{4} = 0$.\nThis is a perfect square trinomial: $(\\cos A - \\frac{1}{2})^2 = 0$.\nThis gives $\\cos A = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince A is an angle in a triangle, $0 < A < \\pi$. The angle A for which $\\cos A = 1/2$ is $A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\n(2) From part (1), we have $A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, so $\\cos A = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFrom the Law of Cosines, we know $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A$.\nSubstituting $\\cos A = 1/2$, we get $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc(\\frac{1}{2})$, which simplifies to:\n$a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$ (Equation 1).\n\nWe are given the condition $b-c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}a$. We can write this as $a = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3}}(b-c) = \\sqrt{3}(b-c)$.\nNow, substitute this expression for $a$ into Equation 1:\n$(\\sqrt{3}(b-c))^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$\n$3(b-c)^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$\n$3(b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = b^2 + c^2 - bc$\n$3b^2 - 6bc + 3c^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$\n$2b^2 - 5bc + 2c^2 = 0$.\n\nThis is a quadratic-like equation in terms of b and c. We can factor it. Divide by $c^2$ (assuming $c\\neq 0$):\n$2(\\frac{b}{c})^2 - 5(\\frac{b}{c}) + 2 = 0$.\nLet $x = b/c$. The equation is $2x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0$. \nFactoring gives $(2x-1)(x-2)=0$.\nSo, $x = 1/2$ or $x=2$. This means $\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{1}{2}$ (i.e., $c=2b$) or $\\frac{b}{c} = 2$ (i.e., $b=2c$).\n\nLet's check these with the condition $b-c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}a > 0$ (since a, b, c are side lengths, and if $b=c$, $a=0$, which is impossible). So $b>c$. This means we must have $b=2c$.\n\nNow we have the relationship between the three sides: $b=2c$. Let's find $a$ in terms of $c$.\n$a = \\sqrt{3}(b-c) = \\sqrt{3}(2c-c) = \\sqrt{3}c$.\nSo, the sides are $a=\\sqrt{3}c$, $b=2c$, and $c$.\n\nLet's check if they satisfy the Pythagorean theorem:\n$a^2 + c^2 = (\\sqrt{3}c)^2 + c^2 = 3c^2 + c^2 = 4c^2$.\n$b^2 = (2c)^2 = 4c^2$.\nSince $a^2 + c^2 = b^2$, the triangle is a right-angled triangle, with the right angle at B.\nTherefore, $\\triangle ABC$ is a right-angled triangle.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：(2) Since $b-c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} a$, I substitute $b = c + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} a$ into the Law of Cosines but can't show the triangle is right-angled. I think there isn't enough information to prove it.\nTeacher：In part (2), you assumed the Law of Cosines without first establishing a relationship between the sides or angles that would lead to a right angle. You need to connect the given condition with the properties of a right-angled triangle.\nStudent：But I thought that by plugging $b = c + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} a$ into Law of Cosines, I could check for a right angle. Should I have looked at angle B or C first?\nTeacher：To prove a triangle is right-angled, you must show that one angle is $90^\\circ$, which corresponds to the Pythagorean relationship between the sides. You have not yet established which angle could be $90^\\circ$ or demonstrated that the sides satisfy this relationship.\nStudent：Should I try expressing $a^2$, $b^2$, or $c^2$ in terms of the other sides and see if the Pythagorean theorem holds for any of them?\nTeacher：Yes, you should express $a^2$, $b^2$, or $c^2$ in terms of the other sides using the Law of Cosines and check if the Pythagorean theorem holds for any angle. You have not yet done this explicitly.\nStudent：Okay, I will try to use the Law of Cosines to express $a^2$, $b^2$, and $c^2$ in terms of the other sides, and see if any Pythagorean relationship appears.\nTeacher：You have not yet used the result from part (1) to relate the sides or angles, which is essential for establishing the Pythagorean relationship. You need to connect angle A with the side lengths before proceeding.\nStudent：So should I start by substituting the value of angle A from part (1) into the Law of Cosines?\nTeacher：Yes, you should first determine the measure of angle A from part (1) and then use that to relate the sides before applying the Law of Cosines. You have not yet used the result from part (1) in your reasoning for part (2).\nStudent：Alright, I will calculate angle A from part (1) and then substitute it into the Law of Cosines to relate the sides.\nTeacher：You have not yet solved part (1) to find the measure of angle A, which is essential for part (2). You cannot proceed without this information.\nStudent：Oh, okay. I haven’t actually solved for angle A in part (1) yet.\nTeacher：You have not yet addressed part (1), which is necessary to determine the measure of angle A. Without this, you cannot proceed with part (2). Solve part (1) first.\nStudent：Let $\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+A\\right)+\\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$.\n\n$\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+A\\right) = -\\sin A$, so the equation becomes $(-\\sin A)^2 + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$.\n\nThus, $\\sin^2 A + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$.\n\nSince $\\sin^2 A = 1 - \\cos^2 A$, \n$1 - \\cos^2 A + \\cos A = \\frac{5}{4}$\n\nSo, $-\\cos^2 A + \\cos A + 1 - \\frac{5}{4} = 0$\n\n$-\\cos^2 A + \\cos A - \\frac{1}{4} = 0$ \n\nMultiply both sides by $-1$: \n$\\cos^2 A - \\cos A + \\frac{1}{4} = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in $\\cos A$:\n$\\cos^2 A - \\cos A + \\frac{1}{4} = 0$\n\nLet $x = \\cos A$:\n$x^2 - x + \\frac{1}{4} = 0$\n\nSolve for $x$:\n$x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 1}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo $\\cos A = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nTherefore, $A = 60^\\circ$\nTeacher：You correctly transformed the equation and solved for $\\cos A$, but you did not consider the domain of $A$ in a triangle. The value $\\cos A = \\frac{1}{2}$ corresponds to $A = 60^\\circ$ or $A = 300^\\circ$, but $A = 300^\\circ$ is not valid in a triangle since angles must be between $0^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$. Thus, $A = 60^\\circ$ is the only valid solution.\nStudent：Understood. So for part (2), I should use $A = 60^\\circ$ in the Law of Cosines and relate it to the side condition $b-c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}a$.\nTeacher：You have not yet explicitly substituted $A = 60^\\circ$ into the Law of Cosines to express the relationship between the sides, which is necessary to prove the triangle is right-angled. You need to connect this angle with the given side condition.\nStudent：Okay, I will substitute $A = 60^\\circ$ into the Law of Cosines and use $b-c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}a$ to find the relationship among $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nTeacher：You have not yet used the Law of Cosines with $A = 60^\\circ$ to express $a^2$ in terms of $b$ and $c$, which is essential for connecting the given side condition with the Pythagorean theorem.\nStudent：Let me calculate $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos 60^\\circ$. Since $\\cos 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$, this becomes $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$.\nTeacher：You have correctly applied the Law of Cosines for angle $A = 60^\\circ$, but you have not yet substituted the given condition $b - c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}a$ to show that the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem for a right angle. You need to connect this relationship explicitly.\nStudent：I have not yet substituted $b - c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}a$ into $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$.\nTeacher：You have not yet substituted the given condition into the equation $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$ to derive a relationship that confirms the triangle is right-angled. You need to explicitly perform this substitution.\nStudent：Okay, I’ll substitute $b = c + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}a$ into $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$ and see if I can get a Pythagorean relationship.\nTeacher：You have not yet simplified the substituted equation to show that one of the angles is $90^\\circ$ or that the sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. You need to explicitly simplify and verify the relationship.\nStudent：I substituted $b = c + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} a$ into $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$, but after expanding, I couldn't show $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ or any Pythagorean identity.\nTeacher：You have not yet correctly simplified the substituted equation to demonstrate that one of the angles is $90^\\circ$ or that the sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. You need to explicitly simplify and verify the relationship.\nStudent：I expanded the expression, but after simplification, I didn't observe any form of the Pythagorean theorem.\nTeacher：You have not yet correctly substituted and simplified the expression to reveal a Pythagorean relationship. You need to carefully expand and simplify the equation to demonstrate that one of the angles is $90^\\circ$.\nStudent：I tried simplifying, but I still couldn't clearly show a right angle or a Pythagorean form.\nTeacher：You have not yet correctly substituted and simplified the expression to reveal a Pythagorean relationship. You need to carefully expand and simplify the equation to demonstrate that one of the angles is $90^\\circ$.\nStudent：I substituted $b = c + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} a$ into $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc$, expanded and simplified, but could not get a Pythagorean relation or confirm a right angle.\nTeacher：You have not yet correctly expanded and simplified the expression to reveal a Pythagorean relationship. You need to carefully re-express the equation in terms of $a$ and verify that one side squared equals the sum of the other two sides squared.\nStudent：I expanded the equation after substituting, but I still didn't manage to express it such that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ or any similar Pythagorean relationship appeared.\nTeacher：You have not yet correctly substituted and simplified the equation to reveal a Pythagorean relationship. You need to carefully re-express the equation in terms of $a$ and verify that one side squared equals the sum of the other two sides squared.\nStudent：I substituted and simplified, but I couldn't make the equation look like the Pythagorean theorem, so I thought it's not possible.\nTeacher：You have not yet correctly simplified the equation to reveal a Pythagorean relationship. You need to carefully re-express the equation in terms of $a$ and verify that one side squared equals the sum of the other two sides squared.\nStudent：I kept trying but I couldn't get the equation to look like a Pythagorean identity, so I assumed it wasn't enough to prove a right angle.\nTeacher：You have not yet correctly simplified the equation to reveal a Pythagorean relationship. You need to carefully re-express the equation in terms of $a$ and verify that one side squared equals the sum of the other two sides squared.",
