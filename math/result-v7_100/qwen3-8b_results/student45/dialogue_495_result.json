    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：2\nTeacher：What is the relationship between $ |z_1 + z_2| $ and $ |z_1 - z_2| $ when $ |z_1| = |z_2| $?\nStudent：I think $|z_1 + z_2|$ and $|z_1 - z_2|$ are related through the parallelogram law: $|z_1 + z_2|^2 + |z_1 - z_2|^2 = 2(|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2)$.\nTeacher：You mentioned the parallelogram law. What is $ |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 $?\nStudent：$|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 8$.\nTeacher：You stated $ |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 8 $. What is $ |z_1 + z_2|^2 $?\nStudent：$|z_1 + z_2|^2 = |\\sqrt{3} + i|^2 = (\\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2 = 3 + 1 = 4$.\nTeacher：You calculated $ |z_1 + z_2|^2 = 4 $. Using the parallelogram law, what is $ |z_1 - z_2|^2 $?\nStudent：Using the parallelogram law, $|z_1 - z_2|^2 = 2 \\times 8 - 4 = 12$.\nTeacher：Then $ |z_1 - z_2| = \\sqrt{12} $. However, you did not simplify the square root correctly. The correct value is $ 2\\sqrt{3} $, not $ \\sqrt{12} $.\nStudent：Sorry, I made a calculation error. $|z_1 - z_2| = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\nTeacher：You correctly identified the error and provided the right answer. Your final response is accurate.\nStudent：Thank you.\nTeacher：You're welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\nStudent：2\nTeacher：You previously stated that $ |z_1 - z_2| = \\sqrt{12} $. However, you later corrected yourself to $ 2\\sqrt{3} $. This indicates that you recognized and fixed your mistake. Your final answer is correct.\nStudent：Thank you.\nTeacher：You're welcome!
