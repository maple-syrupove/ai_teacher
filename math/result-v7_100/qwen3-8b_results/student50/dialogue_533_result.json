    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $y= \\pm x$\nTeacher：The eccentricity of a hyperbola is given by $ e = \\frac{c}{a} $, where $ c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $. You have correctly identified the asymptotes formula as $ y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a} x $, but you have not used the eccentricity to find the relationship between $ a $ and $ b $. What is the relationship between $ e $, $ a $, and $ b $?\nStudent：The relationship is $e = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly expressed the relationship between $ e $, $ a $, and $ b $. Now, substitute the given eccentricity $ e = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} $ into this equation and solve for $ \\frac{b}{a} $. What value do you get for $ \\frac{b}{a} $?\nStudent：Substituting, \n$$\n\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a}\n$$\nSo,\n$$\n\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}a\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives $a^2 + b^2 = \\frac{5}{4}a^2$, so $b^2 = \\frac{1}{4}a^2$, thus $b/a = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $ \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{2} $. Therefore, the asymptotes should be $ y = \\pm \\frac{1}{2} x $, which corresponds to option D. What is your final answer?\nStudent：My final answer is D. $y= \\pm \\frac{1}{2} x$\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the asymptotes as $ y = \\pm \\frac{1}{2} x $, which corresponds to option D. Your final answer is correct.\nStudent：Thank you, teacher.\nTeacher：You are welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Have a great day!\nStudent：C. $y= \\pm x$\nTeacher：You have selected option C, but the correct value of $ \\frac{b}{a} $ is $ \\frac{1}{2} $, not 1. What is the relationship between $ \\frac{b}{a} $ and the asymptotes?\nStudent：The asymptotes for the hyperbola are given by $y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a} x$, so $\\frac{b}{a}$ is the slope.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the formula for the asymptotes. Since $ \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{2} $, the asymptotes should be $ y = \\pm \\frac{1}{2} x $, which corresponds to option D.
