Therefore, option A does not evaluate to a purely imaginary number.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：Let me ask you: What is the value of $ (1+i)^2 $?\nStudent：$(1+i)^2 = 1^2 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i + (-1) = 2i$\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $ (1+i)^2 = 2i $. However, let me ask you: What is the value of $ i^2(1-i) $?\nStudent：$i^2(1-i) = (-1)(1-i) = -1 + i$\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $ i^2(1-i) = -1 + i $. Is $ -1 + i $ a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：No, $-1 + i$ has both real and imaginary parts, so it is not purely imaginary.\nTeacher：Teacher：You have correctly identified that $-1 + i$ is not purely imaginary. Therefore, option B also does not evaluate to a purely imaginary number. Let me ask you: What is the value of $ (1+i)^2 $?\nStudent：$(1+i)^2 = 1^2 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i + (-1) = 2i$\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $ (1+i)^2 = 2i $. Let me ask you: Is $ 2i $ a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：Yes, $2i$ is a purely imaginary number.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $ 2i $ is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, option C evaluates to a purely imaginary number.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that option C evaluates to a purely imaginary number. Let me ask you: What is the value of $ i(1+i) $?\nStudent：$i(1+i) = i \\cdot 1 + i \\cdot i = i + i^2 = i + (-1) = -1 + i$\nTeacher：You have correctly calculated $ i(1+i) = -1 + i $. Is $ -1 + i $ a purely imaginary number?\nStudent：No, $-1 + i$ has both a real part and an imaginary part, so it is not purely imaginary.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $-1 + i$ is not purely imaginary. Therefore, option D does not evaluate to a purely imaginary number. The correct answer is option C.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that option C evaluates to a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that option C evaluates to a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that option C evaluates to a purely imaginary number.
