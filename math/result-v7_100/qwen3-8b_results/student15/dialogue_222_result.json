What equation do you get?\nStudent：I get $2|b|^2 \\cos\\theta = |b|^2$. Dividing both sides by $|b|^2$, I get $2\\cos\\theta = 1$, so $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：Then why did you calculate $\\cos\\theta = 2$? That contradicts your own derivation.\nStudent：Because originally, I took $|a| = 2|b|$ and substituted it incorrectly into the cosine formula, without using the dot product condition.\nTeacher：You incorrectly substituted the magnitudes into the cosine formula without considering the relationship derived from the perpendicularity condition.\nStudent：zzc",
