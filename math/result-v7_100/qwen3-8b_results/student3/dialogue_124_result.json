    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D.\nTeacher：What is the definition of an odd function?\nStudent：An odd function satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：What happens to $ |f(x) \\bullet g(x)| $ when you replace $ x $ with $ -x $?\nStudent：If we replace $x$ with $-x$, we get $|f(-x) \\bullet g(-x)|$. Since $f(-x) = -f(x)$ and $g(-x) = g(x)$, this becomes $|{-f(x)} \\bullet g(x)| = | -f(x)g(x)| = |f(x)g(x)|$.\nTeacher：So, does $ |f(x) \\bullet g(x)| $ satisfy the condition for being an odd function?\nStudent：No, because $|f(-x) \\bullet g(-x)| = |f(x) \\bullet g(x)|$, which means it is an even function, not an odd function.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that $ |f(x) \\bullet g(x)| $ is even, not odd. Therefore, option D is incorrect. What about option C?\nStudent：Option C is $f(x) \\bullet |g(x)|$. If $g(x)$ is even, then $|g(-x)| = |g(x)|$. So,\n\n$f(-x) \\bullet |g(-x)| = -f(x) \\bullet |g(x)| = -[f(x) \\bullet |g(x)|]$.\n\nTherefore, $f(x) \\bullet |g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：You have correctly shown that $ f(x) \\bullet |g(x)| $ satisfies the condition for being an odd function. Therefore, option C is correct.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that option C is the correct answer. Therefore, your initial choice of D was incorrect.\nStudent：zzc",
