    "question": "3. During the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control period, a supermarket launched an online sales business and can complete the distribution of 1200 orders per day. Due to a sharp increase in the number of orders, a backlog of orders has occurred. To solve the problem, many volunteers enthusiastically signed up to participate in the distribution work. It is known that on a certain day, the supermarket has a backlog of 500 orders that have not been distributed. The probability that the new orders for the next day will exceed 1600 is 0.05. Each volunteer can complete the distribution of 50 orders per day. To ensure that the probability of completing the backlogged orders and the current day's orders on the next day is not less than 0.95, at least how many volunteers are needed?

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. 10\nTeacher：Let me ask you: What assumption did you make about the distribution of new orders?\nStudent：I assumed that the average number of new orders each day is 1600.\nTeacher：Let me ask you: How did you calculate the number of orders to be distributed on the next day?\nStudent：I added the backlog of 500 to the average new orders, so 500 + 1600 = 2100 orders.\nTeacher：Let me ask you: How did you account for the volunteers' capacity in your calculation?\nStudent：I calculated how many people would be needed by dividing the number of orders that exceed the supermarket’s capacity by 50 (orders per volunteer), and then rounded the result.\nTeacher：Let me ask you: What is the probability distribution of the new orders, and how did you use it in your calculation?\nStudent：I used the value 1600 as the average and just took it directly, without considering the probabilistic guarantee.\nTeacher：Let me ask you: How did you ensure the probability of completing all orders is at least 0.95?\nStudent：I just used the average value of 1600 new orders and didn't specifically ensure the 0.95 probability.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that using the average number of new orders would satisfy the 0.95 probability requirement, without accounting for the probabilistic nature of the order distribution.\nStudent：zzc",
