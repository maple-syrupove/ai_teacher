    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to compute $z - \\bar{z}$ directly as $\\frac{1-\\mathrm{i}}{2+2\\mathrm{i}} - \\frac{1+\\mathrm{i}}{2-2\\mathrm{i}}$.\nTeacher：Your approach is correct, but you did not simplify the expression properly. Did you rationalize the denominators before subtracting?\nStudent：No, I didn't rationalize the denominators before subtracting.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not rationalizing the denominators before performing the subtraction. Let's proceed step by step. Did you simplify each fraction separately before subtracting?\nStudent：No, I tried to subtract them directly without simplifying each fraction separately.\nTeacher：You incorrectly subtracted the complex fractions without first simplifying each term individually. Let's clarify: did you rationalize the denominators of both fractions before proceeding?\nStudent：No, I didn't rationalize the denominators of either fraction before proceeding.\nTeacher：You failed to rationalize the denominators of both complex fractions, which is essential for simplifying them before performing any operations. Let's focus on that step. Did you multiply the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the conjugate of their respective denominators?\nStudent：No, I didn't multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of their denominators.\nTeacher：You did not rationalize the denominators by multiplying the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the conjugate of their respective denominators, which is a critical step in simplifying complex fractions.\nStudent：zzc",
