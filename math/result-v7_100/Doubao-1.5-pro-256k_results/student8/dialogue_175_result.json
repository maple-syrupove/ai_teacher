    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose option A, $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Let's first expand \\((1 + i)^{2}\\). Do you recall the formula \\((a + b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab + b^{2}\\)? How would you expand \\((1 + i)^{2}\\) using this formula?\nStudent：Using that formula: $(1+i)^2 = 1^2 + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot i + (i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2$.\nTeacher：Good expansion. Now, since \\(i^{2}=- 1\\), what is the value of \\(1 + 2i + i^{2}\\)? And then what is the value of \\(i(1 + 2i + i^{2})\\)?\nStudent：$1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i$. Then $i \\times 2i = 2i^2 = 2 \\times (-1) = -2$.\nTeacher：You made a mistake in the last step. When you have \\(i\\times2i\\), you should multiply the coefficients and the \\(i\\) terms. \\(i\\times i = i^{2}\\), so \\(i\\times2i = 2i^{2}=-2\\) is a real number, not the process for getting a purely imaginary number.\nStudent：Oh, so $i(1+i)^2 = -2$, which is a real number, not purely imaginary.\nTeacher：You correctly realized that your initial choice of option A was wrong as the result is real. Now, considering the other options, how would you start analyzing option B, \\(i^{2}(1 - i)\\)?\nStudent：For option B, I'd start by calculating $i^2$ first, which is $-1$. Then I'd multiply $-1$ by $(1-i)$.\nTeacher：Good start. What do you get when you multiply -1 by (1 - i)? Make sure to distribute -1 correctly.\nStudent：$-1 \\times (1 - i) = -1 + i$.\nTeacher：You are on the right track. But remember, a purely imaginary number has no real part. The result \\(-1 + i\\) has a real part of -1. So option B is not a purely imaginary number. Now, let's consider option C, \\((1 + i)^{2}\\). You already expanded it as \\(2i\\) before. What type of number is \\(2i\\)?\nStudent：$2i$ is a purely imaginary number, since its real part is $0$.\nTeacher：Correct. You've identified that option C results in a purely imaginary number.
