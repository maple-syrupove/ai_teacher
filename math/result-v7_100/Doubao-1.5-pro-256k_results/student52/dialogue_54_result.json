The correct identity should be used for \\(\\tan(A + B)\\) properly. \nStudent：I thought I could just add \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) directly to both sides because the equation had \\(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\).\nTeacher：The key mistake is that you can't simply add \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) to the argument of the tangent function like that. You need to use the tangent addition formula \\(\\tan(A + B)=\\frac{\\tan A+\\tan B}{1 - \\tan A\\tan B}\\) correctly with \\(A=\\alpha-\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(B = \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\).\nStudent：zzc",
