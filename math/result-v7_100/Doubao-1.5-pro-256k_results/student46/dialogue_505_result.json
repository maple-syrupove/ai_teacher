    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$m = \\dfrac{1}{2}$\nTeacher：First, find the equation of the asymptotes of the hyperbola. What is the equation of the asymptotes of the hyperbola $y^{2}-\\frac{x^{2}}{m^{2}} = 1$? And what is the standard form of the given circle equation?\nStudent：The asymptotes are $y^2 - \\frac{x^2}{m^2} = 0$, or $y = \\pm \\frac{x}{m}$. The circle equation is $x^2 + y^2 - 4y + 3 = 0$.\nTeacher：Good. Now, convert the circle equation to standard form $(x - a)^2+(y - b)^2 = r^2$. What are the center and radius of the circle? And how do you use the condition that the asymptotes are tangent to the circle?\nStudent：The center is at (0,0) and radius is $\\sqrt{3}$. The distance from the center to the asymptotes should be equal to the radius.\nTeacher：There's an error. The center of the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}-4y + 3 = 0$ is $(0,2)$ (not $(0,0)$) after converting to standard form $x^{2}+(y - 2)^{2}=1$ with radius $1$ (not $\\sqrt{3}$). \nStudent：zzc",
