    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: $y = 2x + 0.5$.\nTeacher：Let's think about the formula for the equation of a tangent line, $y - y_0 = f'(x_0)(x - x_0)$. How did you find the derivative $f'(x)$ of $y = 2\\ln(x + 1)$ to get the slope for the tangent line equation?\nStudent：I just used the values from the function and didn't actually compute the derivative $f'(x)$.\nTeacher：The error is that you need to first find the derivative of the function $y = 2\\ln(x + 1)$ to get the slope of the tangent line at the given point, but you didn't do that and instead used values from the function. \nStudent：zzc",
