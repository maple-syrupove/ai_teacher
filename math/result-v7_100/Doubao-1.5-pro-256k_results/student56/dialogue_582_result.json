    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I answered \"cannot be determined\".\nTeacher：Do you recall the double - angle and co - function identities related to trigonometry? How might they be applied to the given $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha)$ to find $\\sin2\\alpha$?\nStudent：I remember the double-angle formula $\\sin 2\\alpha = 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$, but I wasn't sure how to use it here because I didn't have values for $\\sin\\alpha$ or $\\cos\\alpha$.\nTeacher：Notice the relationship between $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha)$ and $\\sin2\\alpha$. There are other trigonometric identities like $\\cos(A - B)=\\cos A\\cos B+\\sin A\\sin B$ and $\\sin2\\alpha=\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-2\\alpha)$. Did you consider these connections?\nStudent：I saw those identities but I still couldn't see how to relate $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha)$ directly to $\\sin 2\\alpha$.\nTeacher：Have you considered using the identity $\\sin2\\alpha=\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-2\\alpha)$ and then the double - angle formula for cosine $\\cos2\\theta = 2\\cos^{2}\\theta - 1$ with $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha$? The key error may be not exploring these connections thoroughly.\nStudent：I didn't think to use that approach. I mainly looked at $\\sin 2\\alpha = 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$ and got stuck because I didn't know $\\sin\\alpha$ or $\\cos\\alpha$.\nTeacher：Your error was fixating only on the formula $\\sin 2\\alpha = 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$. You overlooked using $\\sin2\\alpha=\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-2\\alpha)$ and the double - angle formula for cosine with $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha$. \nStudent：zzc",
