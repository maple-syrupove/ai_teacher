    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. $\\sqrt{3}$\nTeacher：Let's consider the base area first. The area of the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) with side length \\(a = 2\\) is \\(S=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^{2}=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\times2^{2}=\\sqrt{3}\\). Now, how did you find the height of the pyramid?\nStudent：I tried to use the formula for the distance from point \\(P\\) to the base triangle \\(ABC\\), but I wasn't sure how to find the height, so I got confused.\nTeacher：Since you were confused about finding the height, did you perhaps assume an incorrect method for determining the perpendicular from point \\(P\\) to the base \\(\\triangle ABC\\)? Maybe you overlooked some geometric relationships among the edges of the pyramid?\nStudent：Yes, I think I missed some geometric relationships among the edges and couldn't figure out the right way to find the perpendicular.\nTeacher：It seems you failed to properly analyze the geometric structure of the triangular pyramid to establish the relationship that would help you find the height accurately. This led to confusion in calculating the volume.\nStudent：zzc",
