    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose C. The graph of $f(x)$ is symmetric with respect to the line $x=\\pi$.\nTeacher：To check symmetry about the line $x = \\pi$, we need to verify if $f(\\pi + x)=f(\\pi - x)$ for all $x$ in the domain. Have you actually calculated $f(\\pi + x)$ and $f(\\pi - x)$ to confirm this symmetry?\nStudent：I calculated $f(\\pi - x)$ and found that it equals $f(x)$, so I thought that meant the graph is symmetric about $x = \\pi$. I did not calculate $f(\\pi + x)$.\nTeacher：The error is that for symmetry about the line $x=\\pi$, you must show $f(\\pi + x)=f(\\pi - x)$. You only calculated $f(\\pi - x)$ and wrongly assumed symmetry based on its relation to $f(x)$ without checking $f(\\pi + x)$. \nStudent：zzc",
