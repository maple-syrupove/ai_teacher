    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A. $\\{-2,-1,0,1\\}$.\nTeacher：Recall the definition of the intersection of sets. For an element to be in $M\\cap N$, it must satisfy the condition of set $M$ (i.e., $-3 < x < 1$). Does the element $1$ meet this condition?\nStudent：No, $1$ does not satisfy $-3 < x < 1$ because it is not strictly less than $1$.\nTeacher：Correct. Your error was including the element 1 in the intersection $M\\cap N$. Since in set $M$, $x$ must be strictly less than 1, 1 should not be part of $M\\cap N$.\nStudent：zzc",
