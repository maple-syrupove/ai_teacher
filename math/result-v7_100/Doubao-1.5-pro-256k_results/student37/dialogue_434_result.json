    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Cannot be determined.\nTeacher：Can you tell me what property of vectors you thought of when dealing with $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{c}=0$? How did you start substituting $\\vec{c}=t\\vec{a}+(1 - t)\\vec{b}$ into this dot - product equation?\nStudent：I substituted $\\vec{c}=t\\vec{a}+(1-t)\\vec{b}$ into the equation and got $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{c} = t\\,\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a} + (1-t)\\,\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{b}$.\nTeacher：Good. Now, since $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are unit vectors and the angle between them is $60^{\\circ}$, what values should $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{b}$ have? Did you use the correct formula for the dot - product of two vectors?\nStudent：$\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} = |\\vec{b}||\\vec{a}|\\cos 60^\\circ$ and $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 1$ since $\\vec{b}$ is a unit vector.\nTeacher：Since $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} = |\\vec{b}||\\vec{a}|\\cos 60^{\\circ}=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 1$, when you substitute into $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{c} = t\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a}+(1 - t)\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{b}=0$, did you set up the resulting equation correctly?\nStudent：I substituted the values, so I wrote $t \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (1-t) \\cdot 1 = 0$.\nTeacher：It seems you set up the equation correctly. But perhaps you made an error when solving the equation $t\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}+(1 - t)\\cdot1 = 0$. Did you distribute and combine like - terms accurately?\nStudent：I got $t \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 - t = 0$, but then I thought $t$ could not be determined, so I left it blank.\nTeacher：The error is that when solving the equation $\\frac{t}{2}+1 - t = 0$, you wrongly concluded that $t$ cannot be determined. You should combine like - terms and solve for $t$. \nStudent：zzc",
