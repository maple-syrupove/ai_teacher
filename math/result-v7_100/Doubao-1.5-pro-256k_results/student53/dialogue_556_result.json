    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C. 0.6 as my answer.\nTeacher：Remember the concept of conditional probability. The probability of two consecutive days being excellent (0.6) is not the same as the probability that the next day is excellent given one day is excellent. How do you think conditional probability is calculated?\nStudent：I'm not sure how to set up the equation to calculate the conditional probability.\nTeacher：Conditional probability is calculated as \\(P(B|A)=\\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(A)}\\). In this case, \\(A\\) is the event that the air quality on a certain day is excellent (\\(P(A) = 0.75\\)), and \\(A\\cap B\\) is the event that the air quality is excellent for two - consecutive days (\\(P(A\\cap B)=0.6\\)).
