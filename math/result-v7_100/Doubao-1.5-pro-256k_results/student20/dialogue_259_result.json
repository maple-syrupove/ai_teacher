How did you attempt to relate the given sums to find the common ratio?\nStudent：I wrote $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1$, $a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 2$ as equations for four unknowns, but I couldn't find how to get the common ratio directly.\nTeacher：The error is that instead of writing the sums as equations for four separate unknowns, you should use the property of geometric sequence where \\(a_{n + 1}=a_{n}\\cdot r\\). So \\(a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}=(a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3})\\cdot r\\).\nStudent：zzc",
