    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. 10\nTeacher：Let's first consider the equation of the line. The line passes through \\((-2,0)\\) with a slope of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), so its equation is \\(y = \\frac{2}{3}(x + 2)\\). Then we substitute \\(y\\) into the parabola equation \\(y^{2}=4x\\). Have you set up this substitution correctly?\nStudent：Yes, I substituted \\(y = \\frac{2}{3}(x + 2)\\) into \\(y^2 = 4x\\).\nTeacher：After substitution, you should get a quadratic equation in \\(x\\). Did you correctly solve this quadratic equation to find the coordinates of points \\(M\\) and \\(N\\)? Also, did you accurately determine the coordinates of the focus \\(F\\) of the parabola \\(y^{2}=4x\\)?\nStudent：Yes, I solved the quadratic equation and found the coordinates for M and N, and I know the focus F is at (1,0).\nTeacher：If you've done all that correctly, then when calculating \\(\\overrightarrow{FM}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{FN}\\), did you use the correct formula for the dot - product based on the coordinates of \\(M\\), \\(N\\) and \\(F\\)? The dot - product formula is \\(\\overrightarrow{a}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{b}=x_1x_2 + y_1y_2\\) for \\(\\overrightarrow{a}=(x_1,y_1)\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{b}=(x_2,y_2)\\).\nStudent：I used the product of the distances from F to M and F to N instead of the coordinate-based dot product formula.\nTeacher：Your mistake was using the product of distances instead of the coordinate - based dot - product formula \\(\\overrightarrow{a}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{b}=x_1x_2 + y_1y_2\\) to calculate \\(\\overrightarrow{FM}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{FN}\\).\nStudent：zzc",
