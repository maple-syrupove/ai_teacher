    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B\nTeacher：First, recall the properties of an even function. Since \\(f(x)\\) is even, \\(f(x)=f(-x)\\). So \\(f(\\log_{5}\\frac{1}{4}) = f(-\\log_{5}4)=f(\\log_{5}4)\\) and \\(f(\\log_{8}\\frac{1}{4})=f(-\\log_{8}4)=f(\\log_{8}4)\\). Do you know how to compare the magnitudes of \\(\\log_{5}4\\), \\(\\log_{8}4\\), \\(2^{-\\frac{2}{3}}\\) and \\(2^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\)?\nStudent：I tried to compare the values directly, but I wasn't sure how to transform them for comparison.\nTeacher：Let's focus on the fact that \\(y = \\log_{a}x\\) and \\(y = a^{x}\\) functions have specific properties for comparison. For the logarithmic values, how did you use the change - of - base formula to make the comparison easier? And for the exponential values, what rule did you apply to compare \\(2^{-\\frac{2}{3}}\\) and \\(2^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\)? \nStudent：For the exponents, I just looked at the fractions and thought that since \\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\) is greater than \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\), \\(2^{-\\frac{2}{3}}\\) would be larger than \\(2^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\); for the logarithms, I didn't use the change-of-base formula.\nTeacher：Your error in comparing the logarithmic values is not using the change - of - base formula. This makes it difficult to accurately compare \\(\\log_{5}4\\) and \\(\\log_{8}4\\) with the exponential values.\nStudent：zzc",
