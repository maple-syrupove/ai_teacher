    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$z = \\frac{2+i}{i} = 2/i + 1$\nTeacher：The error is in the simplification of the denominator. You incorrectly calculated $1 + i^2 + i^5$. Recall the powers of $i$: $i^2=-1$ and $i^5 = i$. So the denominator should be $1+( - 1)+i = i$. But your simplification seems off. \nStudent：But I did calculate $i^2 = -1$ and $i^5 = i$, so the denominator became $1 + (-1) + i = i$.\nTeacher：If the denominator is $i$, when you rewrite $\\frac{2 + i}{i}$ as $\\frac{2}{i}+1$, it's wrong. When dividing by $i$, you should multiply numerator and denominator by $i$'s conjugate to simplify correctly.\nStudent：zzc",
