    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Let $AB = x$, $AC = \\sqrt{2}x$, $AD = \\sqrt{2}$, and $\\angle ADB = 135^\\circ$. Then I set $BD = y$ and wrote: $BC = 3y$, $CD = 2y$.\nTeacher：That's a good start. Now, in which formula did you use these values next? Did you perhaps forget to consider the relationship between the angles and sides correctly in the formula you chose, like the Law of Cosines?\nStudent：I tried to set up the Law of Cosines in triangle $ADB$: $AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BD \\cdot \\cos 135^\\circ$.\nTeacher：That's correct for $\\triangle ADB$. What about applying the Law of Cosines in $\\triangle ADC$? Did you use the correct angle and side relationships there? Since $\\angle ADC = 180^{\\circ}-\\angle ADB = 45^{\\circ}$, were the terms in the formula for $\\triangle ADC$ set up accurately?\nStudent：I wrote $AD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2 - 2 \\cdot AC \\cdot CD \\cdot \\cos 45^\\circ$, substituting $AC = \\sqrt{2}x$, $CD = 2y$, and $AD = \\sqrt{2}$.\nTeacher：In the Law of Cosines for $\\triangle ADC$, the correct formula should be $AC^{2}=AD^{2}+CD^{2}-2\\cdot AD\\cdot CD\\cdot\\cos45^{\\circ}$, but you set it up as $AD^{2}=AC^{2}+CD^{2}-2\\cdot AC\\cdot CD\\cdot\\cos45^{\\circ}$. \nStudent：Sorry, I did write it as $AD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2 - 2 \\cdot AC \\cdot CD \\cdot \\cos 45^\\circ$.\nTeacher：The error was using the wrong form of the Law of Cosines in $\\triangle ADC$. The correct form has $AC^{2}$ on the left - hand side, not $AD^{2}$. Do you understand this error?\nStudent：I think I understand; I used $AD^2$ instead of $AC^2$ as the subject in the Law of Cosines for $\\triangle ADC$.\nTeacher：Yes, that's right. You made an error in the setup of the Law of Cosines for $\\triangle ADC$ by incorrectly using $AD^2$ instead of $AC^2$ as the left - hand side of the equation. Do you have any other questions regarding this problem?\nStudent：No, I don't have any other questions about this problem right now.\nTeacher：Since you've identified the error correctly, if you encounter similar problems in the future, be more careful with the form of the Law of Cosines. If you have any new questions, feel free to ask. zzc\nStudent：zzc",
