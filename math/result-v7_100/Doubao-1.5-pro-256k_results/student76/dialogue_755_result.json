    "question": "20. (12 points) In the Cartesian coordinate system $xOy$, the curve $C: y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}$ intersects the line $l: y=k x+a(a>0)$ at two points M and N.\n\n(I) When $k=0$, find the equations of the tangent lines to C at points M and N respectively.\n\n(II) Does there exist a point P on the y-axis such that for any value of k, we always have $\\angle O P M=\\angle O P N$? (Explain your reasoning)\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution: (I) When $k=0$, the line equation becomes $l: y=a$.\nTo find the intersection points M and N, we solve the system:\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y=a \\\\ y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\end{array}\\right.$\nThis gives $\\frac{x^2}{4} = a$, so $x^2 = 4a$, which means $x = \\pm 2\\sqrt{a}$.\nWithout loss of generality, let $M$ be the point with the positive x-coordinate. So, the coordinates are $M(2 \\sqrt{a}, a)$ and $N(-2 \\sqrt{a}, a)$.\n\nThe derivative of the curve $C: y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}$ is $y' = \\frac{2x}{4} = \\frac{x}{2}$.\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at M is $y'|_{x=2\\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{a}}{2} = \\sqrt{a}$.\nThe equation of the tangent line at M is $y - a = \\sqrt{a}(x - 2\\sqrt{a})$.\n$y - a = \\sqrt{a}x - 2a$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{a}x - y - a = 0$.\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at N is $y'|_{x=-2\\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{-2\\sqrt{a}}{2} = -\\sqrt{a}$.\nThe equation of the tangent line at N is $y - a = -\\sqrt{a}(x - (-2\\sqrt{a}))$.\n$y - a = -\\sqrt{a}x - 2a$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{a}x + y + 3a = 0$. (Note: there is a calculation error in the original Chinese answer for the tangent at N. It should be $y-a = -\\sqrt{a}(x+2\\sqrt{a}) \\implies y-a = -\\sqrt{a}x - 2a \\implies \\sqrt{a}x + y + a = 0$). Let's use the correct one: $\\sqrt{a}x + y + a = 0$.\n\n(II) Yes, such a point exists. The point is $P(0, -a)$.\nLet $P$ be a point $(0, b)$ on the y-axis. Let the intersection points be $M(x_1, y_1)$ and $N(x_2, y_2)$. The condition $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ (where O is the origin) means that the line segment OP (which is on the y-axis) is the angle bisector of $\\angle MPN$. This implies that the angles that PM and PN make with the y-axis are equal. This is equivalent to saying that the slopes of PM and PN are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign (i.e., $k_{PM} = -k_{PN}$, or $k_{PM} + k_{PN} = 0$), assuming M and N are on opposite sides of the y-axis (which they are, as we will see).\n\nLet's find the intersection points by solving the system:\n$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y=kx+a \\\\ y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\end{array}\\right.$\n$\frac{x^2}{4} = kx+a \\implies x^2 - 4kx - 4a = 0$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum and product of the roots are: $x_1 + x_2 = 4k$ and $x_1x_2 = -4a$.\nSince $a>0$, $x_1x_2$ is negative, meaning one root is positive and one is negative, so M and N are on opposite sides of the y-axis.\n\nThe slopes of PM and PN are $k_{PM} = \\frac{y_1-b}{x_1}$ and $k_{PN} = \\frac{y_2-b}{x_2}$.\nWe require $k_{PM} + k_{PN} = 0$.\n$\\frac{y_1-b}{x_1} + \\frac{y_2-b}{x_2} = 0$\n$\\frac{x_2(y_1-b) + x_1(y_2-b)}{x_1x_2} = 0$\n$x_2y_1 - bx_2 + x_1y_2 - bx_1 = 0$\nSubstitute $y_1 = kx_1+a$ and $y_2 = kx_2+a$:\n$x_2(kx_1+a) - bx_2 + x_1(kx_2+a) - bx_1 = 0$\n$kx_1x_2 + ax_2 - bx_2 + kx_1x_2 + ax_1 - bx_1 = 0$\n$2k(x_1x_2) + (a-b)(x_1+x_2) = 0$\nNow substitute the values from Vieta's formulas:\n$2k(-4a) + (a-b)(4k) = 0$\n$-8ak + 4k(a-b) = 0$\nSince this must hold for any value of $k$, we can divide by $4k$ (assuming $k \neq 0$. If $k=0$, the condition holds trivially as the setup is symmetric).\n$-2a + (a-b) = 0$\n$-a - b = 0$\n$b = -a$\n\nThus, the point P must be $(0, -a)$. This point is independent of $k$. Therefore, such a point exists, and its coordinates are $(0, -a)$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：(II) I try to find point P(0, b) on the y-axis so that $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$ for any $k$. \n\nI let the coordinates of M and N be the intersection points between $y=\\frac{x^2}{4}$ and $y= kx + a$.\n\nSo $\\frac{x^2}{4}=kx + a$, that is, $x^2 - 4kx - 4a=0$.\n\nThe solutions are $x_1$ and $x_2$.\n\nThen, set up the angle bisector equations through P for $\\angle OPM$ and $\\angle OPN$, but I can’t find a specific $b$ so far.\nTeacher：Rather than setting up angle - bisector equations, consider using the property of the slopes of lines. If $\\angle OPM=\\angle OPN$, what can you say about the relationship between the slopes of $PM$ and $PN$?\nStudent：If $\\angle OPM = \\angle OPN$, then the angles between $OP$ and $PM$, and between $OP$ and $PN$, are equal. So the absolute values of the slopes of $PM$ and $PN$ relative to $OP$ would have some symmetry or equality.\nTeacher：Instead of thinking about slopes relative to $OP$, focus on the slopes of $PM$ and $PN$ directly. If $\\angle OPM=\\angle OPN$, then $k_{PM}+k_{PN} = 0$. Check if you used this relationship correctly in your approach.\nStudent：I didn’t use the $k_{PM}+k_{PN}=0$ relationship in my approach. I tried to set up geometric equations for the angle bisector instead.\nTeacher：Your error was choosing to set up geometric equations for the angle bisector rather than using the key relationship $k_{PM}+k_{PN}=0$, which is a more straightforward way to solve this problem.\nStudent：zzc",
