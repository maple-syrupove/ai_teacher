(12 points) \n(I) Discuss the monotonicity of the function $f(x)=\\frac{x-2}{x+2} e^{x}$, and prove that when $x>0$, $(x-2)e^{x}+x+2>0$.\n\n(II) Prove that when $a \\in[0,1)$, the function $g(x)=\\frac{e^{x}-a x-a}{x^{2}}(x>0)$ has a minimum value. Let the minimum value of $g(x)$ be $h(a)$, and find the range of the function $h(a)$.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\n(I) To discuss the monotonicity of $f(x)$, we find its derivative, $f'(x)$. The domain of f(x) is $(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, +\\infty)$.\nUsing the quotient rule and product rule: $f'(x) = \\left(\\frac{(1)(x+2) - (x-2)(1)}{(x+2)^2}\\right)e^x + \\left(\\frac{x-2}{x+2}\\right)e^x = \\left(\\frac{4}{(x+2)^2} + \\frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{(x+2)^2}\\right)e^x$\n$f'(x) = \\frac{4 + x^2 - 4}{(x+2)^2}e^x = \\frac{x^2 e^x}{(x+2)^2}$.\nSince $x^2 \\ge 0$, $e^x > 0$, and $(x+2)^2 > 0$ for $x \\neq -2$, we have $f'(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$ in the domain. The derivative is 0 only at $x=0$. \nTherefore, $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing on $(-\\infty, -2)$ and on $(-2, +\\infty)$.\n\nTo prove the inequality for $x>0$: since $f(x)$ is increasing on $(-2, +\\infty)$, for any $x>0$, we have $f(x) > f(0)$.\n$f(0) = \\frac{0-2}{0+2}e^0 = \\frac{-2}{2}(1) = -1$.\nSo, for $x>0$, we have $\\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x > -1$. \nMultiplying by $(x+2)$ (which is positive for $x>0$):\n$(x-2)e^x > -(x+2)$\n$(x-2)e^x + x+2 > 0$. The proof is complete.\n\n(II) To find the minimum of $g(x)$, we find its derivative $g'(x)$ for $x>0$.\n$g'(x) = \\frac{(e^x-a)(x^2) - (e^x-ax-a)(2x)}{x^4} = \\frac{x(e^x-a) - 2(e^x-ax-a)}{x^3}$\n$g'(x) = \\frac{xe^x - ax - 2e^x + 2ax + 2a}{x^3} = \\frac{(x-2)e^x + ax + 2a}{x^3}$\n$g'(x) = \\frac{(x+2)(\\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x + a)}{x^3}$.\nSince $x>0$, the sign of $g'(x)$ is determined by the sign of the term $G(x) = \\frac{x-2}{x+2}e^x + a = f(x)+a$.\n\nFrom part (I), $f(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x>0$. Also, $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(x) = f(0) = -1$ and $\\lim_{x\\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$. So, for $x>0$, the range of $f(x)$ is $(-1, \\infty)$.\nWe are looking for roots of $G(x)=0$, which is $f(x) = -a$. \nSince $a \\in [0, 1)$, we have $-a \\in (-1, 0]$. Since $-a$ is in the range of $f(x)$ for $x>0$, and $f(x)$ is strictly increasing, there exists a unique solution $t>0$ such that $f(t)=-a$.\n\n- When $0 < x < t$, $f(x) < f(t) = -a$, so $G(x) < 0$, which means $g'(x) < 0$. Thus, $g(x)$ is decreasing.\n- When $x > t$, $f(x) > f(t) = -a$, so $G(x) > 0$, which means $g'(x) > 0$. Thus, $g(x)$ is increasing.\nThis confirms that $g(x)$ has a unique minimum value at $x=t$. The minimum value is $h(a) = g(t) = \\frac{e^t-at-a}{t^2}$.\n\nTo find the range of $h(a)$, we express it in terms of $t$. From $f(t)=-a$, we have $a = -f(t) = -\\frac{t-2}{t+2}e^t$.\nSubstitute $a$ into the expression for $h(a)$:\n$h(a) = \\frac{e^t - (t+1)a}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t + (t+1)\\frac{t-2}{t+2}e^t}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(1 + \\frac{t^2-t-2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(\\frac{t+2+t^2-t-2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t(\\frac{t^2}{t+2})}{t^2} = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$.\n\nSo, the minimum value is a function of $t$: $h(a) = k(t) = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$.\nWe need to find the range of $k(t)$ for the possible values of $t$. \n$t$ is defined by $f(t) = -a$, where $a \\in [0, 1)$. This means $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$. \nWe need to find the values of $t>0$ for which $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$.\n$f(0)=-1$, and $f(2)=0$. Since $f(x)$ is increasing for $x>0$, $f(t) \\in (-1, 0]$ corresponds to $t \\in (0, 2]$.\n\nNow we find the range of $k(t) = \\frac{e^t}{t+2}$ for $t \\in (0, 2]$.\n$k'(t) = \\frac{e^t(t+2) - e^t(1)}{(t+2)^2} = \\frac{e^t(t+1)}{(t+2)^2}$.\nFor $t>0$, $e^t>0$, $t+1>0$, and $(t+2)^2 > 0$, so $k'(t) > 0$. \nThus, $k(t)$ is strictly increasing on $(0, 2]$.\nThe range of $k(t)$ is therefore $(k(0), k(2)]$.\n$k(0) = \\frac{e^0}{0+2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$k(2) = \\frac{e^2}{2+2} = \\frac{e^2}{4}$.\nThe range of $h(a)$ is $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{e^2}{4}]$.\n",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I calculated $g'(x) = \\frac{(e^{x}-a)x^2 - 2x(e^{x}-ax-a)}{x^4}$. Then I tried to find where $g'(x)=0$ but got stuck simplifying.\nTeacher：Have you considered factoring out common terms in the numerator of $g'(x)$? Maybe there's an easier way to analyze the equation $g'(x) = 0$ rather than brute - force simplification. What common factors do you see in $(e^{x}-a)x^2 - 2x(e^{x}-ax - a)$?\nStudent：In the numerator, both terms have $x$ as a factor. If I factor $x$, it becomes $x\\left[(e^{x}-a)x - 2(e^{x}-ax-a)\\right]$.\nTeacher：Good. Now, expand the expression inside the brackets: $(e^{x}-a)x - 2(e^{x}-ax - a)$. What do you get when you expand it?\nStudent：Expanding, we get: $e^{x}x - a x - 2e^{x} + 2a x + 2a$.\nTeacher：Next, try to group the terms in the expanded expression. How can you group the terms with \\(e^{x}\\) and the terms with \\(a\\) and \\(x\\) to simplify further?\nStudent：Grouping, $e^{x}x - 2e^{x}$ gives $e^{x}(x-2)$, and $-a x + 2a x$ gives $a x$, so combined: $e^{x}(x-2) + a x + 2a$.\nTeacher：You are on the right track with grouping. But when considering the next step to analyze where \\(g'(x) = 0\\), you should factor the entire expression more comprehensively. Notice that \\(e^{x}(x - 2)+ax + 2a\\) can be further factored. What factor can you pull out from \\(ax + 2a\\) and how might that help with the overall factoring? \nStudent：From $ax + 2a$, I can factor out $a$: $a(x + 2)$. So the full expression is $e^{x}(x-2) + a(x+2)$.\nTeacher：Good. But when analyzing the sign of \\(g'(x)\\) to find where it equals zero, you need to consider the properties of \\(e^{x}\\) and the range of \\(a\\) more carefully. How does the fact that \\(a\\in[0,1)\\) affect the behavior of \\(e^{x}(x - 2)+a(x + 2)\\) when looking for roots? \nStudent：Since $a \\in [0,1)$, the term $a(x+2)$ is always less than $(x+2)$ for $x > 0$. The $e^{x}(x - 2)$ grows rapidly with $x$, dominating as $x$ increases, so $g'(x)$ will change sign depending on $x$ and $a$.\nTeacher：You're correctly considering the growth of terms, but when analyzing \\(g'(x)=0\\), you haven't yet set up a proper equation to find the critical points. You should set \\(e^{x}(x - 2)+a(x + 2)=0\\) and then think about how to solve for \\(x\\) based on the given range of \\(a\\). \nStudent：So I set $e^{x}(x-2) + a(x+2) = 0$, and tried isolating $x$, but it didn’t get much simpler for me to solve.\nTeacher：When trying to solve \\(e^{x}(x - 2)+a(x + 2)=0\\) for \\(x\\), rather than directly isolating \\(x\\), you should consider the function's behavior. You might analyze the function \\(y = e^{x}(x - 2)\\) and \\(y=-a(x + 2)\\) and find their intersection points instead of algebraic isolation. \nStudent：Ok, so for each $a$, we can regard $e^{x}(x-2)$ and $-a(x+2)$ as two curves in $x>0$, and their intersection will determine the critical point(s). I can try solving $e^{x}(x-2) = -a(x+2)$ for $x$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is that instead of just analyzing the intersection of the two curves to find the critical points' existence, you are still focusing on the difficult task of exactly solving \\(e^{x}(x - 2)=-a(x + 2)\\) for \\(x\\). Analyzing the existence is sufficient for finding the minimum value here. \nStudent：Understood. So for the minimum, I could look at the monotonicity of $g(x)$ by examining the sign changes in $g'(x)$ based on intersections, rather than trying to explicitly solve $e^x(x-2)=-a(x+2)$.\nTeacher：Correct. Now that you've identified the error, do you have any further questions regarding this problem? If not, please reply with \"zzc\".\nStudent：zzc",
