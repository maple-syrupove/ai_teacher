Only provide the information necessary to answer the teacher's current question.\n**If the teacher points out your mistake in a statement and this accusation exactly matches the reason in 【Specific Error JSON】, you must respond with the exact string \"zzc\". If the teacher states an error that does not match your actual mistake, you should deny it and wait for the teacher's next question. If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly. Exception: If asked what your mistake is (e.g., \"What was your error?\"), reply \"I don't know\" and do not reveal the reason.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：D\nTeacher：Can you explain how you arrived at option D? Specifically, which vector relationships or operations did you use to get that result?\nStudent：I used the idea that E is the midpoint, so I thought I could use the formula for a midpoint involving AB and AC to find EB.\nTeacher：When using the mid - point formula, you might have mis - applied the vector addition and subtraction rules. Remember, vectors have direction and the relationships between $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, $\\overrightarrow{AC}$, and $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ need to be carefully considered. How did you exactly set up the mid - point formula in terms of these vectors?\nStudent：I set up E as the midpoint of AD, but I thought of EB as if E were the midpoint of BC, so I used EB = ½(AB + AC).\nTeacher：Your mistake is that you wrongly assumed E is the midpoint of BC instead of AD when applying the mid - point vector formula. EB is not equal to ½(AB + AC). \nStudent：zzc",
