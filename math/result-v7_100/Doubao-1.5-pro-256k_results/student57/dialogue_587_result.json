    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose B. $\\frac{9\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：Did you consider the relationship between the radius of the sphere and the dimensions of the right - triangular prism correctly? Remember, the diameter of the inscribed sphere is limited by the smallest cross - sectional dimension of the prism.\nStudent：I just used half of the prism’s height as the radius and didn’t compare it to the base’s inradius.\nTeacher：Your error was assuming the radius is simply half of the prism's height without first checking if the sphere can fit in the base triangle. The in - radius of the base right - triangle also affects the maximum size of the sphere.\nStudent：I see, so I should've also calculated the inradius of the base triangle and compared it to half of the height?\nTeacher：Yes, that's correct. Your initial mistake was overlooking the significance of the in - radius of the base right - triangle when determining the maximum radius of the inscribed sphere.\n\nDo you have any other questions or need further clarification?\nStudent：No, thank you. I understand now that I need to compare both constraints to find the correct maximum radius.\nTeacher：Since you seem to have grasped the error, if you want to confirm your understanding is complete, please reply with \"zzc\".\nStudent：zzc",
