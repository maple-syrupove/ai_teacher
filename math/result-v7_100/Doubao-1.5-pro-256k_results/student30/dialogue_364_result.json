    "question": "18. (12 points) A supermarket plans to order a certain type of yogurt on a monthly basis. The daily stock is the same. The purchase cost is 4 yuan per bottle, and the selling price is 6 yuan per bottle. Unsold yogurt is sold at a reduced price of 2 yuan per bottle and is completely cleared out on the same day. Based on past sales experience, the daily demand is related to the daily maximum temperature (in ${}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$). If the maximum temperature is not less than 25, the demand is 500 bottles; if the maximum temperature is in the interval [20, 25), the demand is 300 bottles; if the maximum temperature is below 20, the demand is 200 bottles. To determine the order plan for June, the maximum temperature data for each day in June for the past three years were collected, resulting in the following frequency distribution table:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline Max Temperature & {$[10,15)$} & {$[15,20)$} & {$[20,25)$} & {$[25,30)$} & {$[30,35)$} & {$[35,40)$} \\\\\n\\hline Number of Days & 2 & 16 & 36 & 25 & 7 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nUse the frequency of the maximum temperature being in each interval to estimate the probability of it being in that interval.\n\n(1) Find the probability that the daily demand for this yogurt in June is no more than 300 bottles.\n\n(2) Let the daily profit from selling this yogurt in June be Y (in yuan). If the daily stock of this yogurt in June is 450 bottles, write down all possible values of Y and estimate the probability that Y is greater than zero.\n",
    "correct_answer": "Solution:\nThe total number of days in the data is the sum of the frequencies: $2+16+36+25+7+4 = 90$ days.\n\n(1) The daily demand is no more than 300 bottles when the maximum temperature is less than 25${}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\nThis corresponds to the temperature intervals $[10,15)$, $[15,20)$, and $[20,25)$.\nNumber of days with temperature less than 25${}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ = (Days in $[10,15)$) + (Days in $[15,20)$) + (Days in $[20,25)$)\n$= 2 + 16 + 36 = 54$ days.\nThe estimated probability is the relative frequency:\n$P(\\text{Demand} \\le 300) = \\frac{\\text{Number of days with temp} < 25}{\\text{Total days}} = \\frac{54}{90} = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6$ or $\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\n(2) The daily stock is fixed at 450 bottles. Profit Y depends on the demand, which in turn depends on the temperature.\nProfit = (Revenue from full-price sales) + (Revenue from reduced-price sales) - (Total cost).\nTotal cost = $450 \\times 4 = 1800$ yuan.\n\nCase 1: Temperature $\\ge 25^{\\circ}C$ (Demand = 500 bottles)\nSince demand (500) > stock (450), all 450 bottles are sold at the full price of 6 yuan.\nRevenue = $450 \\times 6 = 2700$.\nProfit Y = $2700 - 1800 = 900$ yuan.\n\nCase 2: Temperature $\\in [20, 25)^{\\circ}C$ (Demand = 300 bottles)\nSince demand (300) < stock (450), 300 bottles are sold at 6 yuan, and the remaining $450-300=150$ bottles are sold at 2 yuan.\nRevenue = $(300 \\times 6) + (150 \\times 2) = 1800 + 300 = 2100$.\nProfit Y = $2100 - 1800 = 300$ yuan.\n\nCase 3: Temperature $< 20^{\\circ}C$ (Demand = 200 bottles)\nSince demand (200) < stock (450), 200 bottles are sold at 6 yuan, and the remaining $450-200=250$ bottles are sold at 2 yuan.\nRevenue = $(200 \\times 6) + (250 \\times 2) = 1200 + 500 = 1700$.\nProfit Y = $1700 - 1800 = -100$ yuan.\n\nSo, the possible values of Y are $\\{900, 300, -100\\}$.\n\nY is greater than zero when the profit is 900 or 300. This occurs when the temperature is $\\ge 20^{\\circ}C$.\nWe need to find the number of days with temperature $\\ge 20^{\\circ}C$. From the table, this is:\n(Days in $[20,25)$) + (Days in $[25,30)$) + (Days in $[30,35)$) + (Days in $[35,40)$)\n$= 36 + 25 + 7 + 4 = 72$ days.\n\nThe estimated probability that Y is greater than zero is:\n$P(Y > 0) = \\frac{\\text{Number of days with temp} \\ge 20}{\\text{Total days}} = \\frac{72}{90} = \\frac{8}{10} = 0.8$ or $\\frac{4}{5}$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：The probability is (2+16+36)/6/90 = 54/540 = 0.1.\nTeacher：Your error is in the denominator. When calculating the probability using the frequency distribution, the total number of days in June for the three - year data is 90, not 6×90. So the denominator should be 90 directly.\nStudent：I used 6 as the denominator because there are 6 temperature intervals in the table.\nTeacher：The error is that the denominator for probability calculation should be the total number of days (90), not the number of temperature intervals. The number of intervals is not relevant to the probability - denominator calculation here. \nStudent：zzc",
