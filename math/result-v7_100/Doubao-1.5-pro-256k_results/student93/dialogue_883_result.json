    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A.\nTeacher：Can you explain your reasoning behind choosing A? Specifically, how did you show that statement A is sufficient and not necessary for statement B?\nStudent：I noticed that if $\\{a_n\\}$ is arithmetic, then $S_n$ has a quadratic form, and thus $\\frac{S_n}{n}$ is also arithmetic. I didn't consider the reverse direction.\nTeacher：You made a mistake by not considering the reverse direction. To fully answer this question, you need to analyze if statement B implies statement A as well. \nStudent：Okay, so does that mean I should check whether $\\{\\frac{S_n}{n}\\}$ being arithmetic implies $\\{a_n\\}$ is arithmetic?\nTeacher：Yes, exactly. Your initial error was only analyzing one - way (A implies B) and neglecting to check if B implies A. Now you need to investigate this other direction to determine the correct answer.\nStudent：Understood. Given that $\\left\\{\\frac{S_n}{n}\\right\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence, I should try to express $a_n$ in terms of $S_n$ and see if this forces $\\{a_n\\}$ to be arithmetic, correct?\nTeacher：Correct. Your initial mistake was overlooking the need to prove both directions (A→B and B→A) for a complete determination of the relationship between the two statements. Now you're on the right track.\nStudent：Okay, I'll try deriving $a_n$ from $S_n$ under the assumption that $\\left\\{\\frac{S_n}{n}\\right\\}$ is arithmetic.\nTeacher：Great. Remember, your initial error was only considering the forward direction (A implies B) and not checking the reverse (B implies A). Keep working on the reverse - direction proof.\nStudent：Got it. I'll try to derive $a_n$ in terms of $S_n$ and check if it forces $a_n$ to be arithmetic.\nTeacher：Good. Just to be clear, your initial error was simply not testing the reverse implication. Once you've completed the reverse - direction proof, you'll be able to accurately answer the question.\nStudent：Okay, I will work on checking if B implies A now.\nTeacher：Remember, your original error was only evaluating the sufficiency (A implies B) and failing to assess the necessity (B implies A). This oversight led to an incomplete analysis for answering the question.\nStudent：zzc",
