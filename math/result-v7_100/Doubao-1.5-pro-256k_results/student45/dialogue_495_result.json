If the teacher states an error that does not match your actual mistake, you should deny it and wait for the teacher's next question. If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly.

Can you briefly describe the key steps or concepts you used in your calculation?\nStudent：I saw that |z₁| and |z₂| were both 2, so I assumed |z₁ - z₂| might also just be 2, similar to the modulus values.\nTeacher：Your error is that you made an unfounded assumption.
