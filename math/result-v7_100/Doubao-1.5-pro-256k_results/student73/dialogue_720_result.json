    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option B: $b > a > c$.\nTeacher：How did you compare the values of \\(a = \\frac{31}{32}\\), \\(b=\\cos\\frac{1}{4}\\), and \\(c = 4\\sin\\frac{1}{4}\\)? Did you consider the appropriate trigonometric identities or approximations for these values?\nStudent：I directly calculated the approximate values for each one using a calculator and then compared the results.\nTeacher：When comparing without using a calculator in such problems, direct calculator - based comparison might not be the intended method. What if you were in an exam where calculator use is not allowed? How did you estimate the values of \\(\\cos\\frac{1}{4}\\) and \\(4\\sin\\frac{1}{4}\\) without relying on the calculator?\nStudent：I tried to use Taylor series to estimate their values, but I wasn't sure if my approximations were accurate enough, so I still ended up relying on the calculator for the final comparison.\nTeacher：When solving this type of problem, the goal is likely to use non - calculator methods like trigonometric inequalities or series expansions properly. Relying solely on a calculator may not be the correct approach as it may not test your understanding of relevant mathematical concepts. \nStudent：zzc",
