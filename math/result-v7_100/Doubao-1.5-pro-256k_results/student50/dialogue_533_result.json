If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $y= \\pm x$\nTeacher：How did you calculate the relationship between $a$ and $b$ from the given eccentricity $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$? Remember, the formula for eccentricity $e=\\frac{c}{a}$ and $c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}$. How did you use these to find the asymptote equation?\nStudent：I didn't calculate $a$ and $b$ from the eccentricity. I just remembered that the asymptotes are $y = \\pm x$ for a hyperbola and chose C directly.\nTeacher：The mistake is that you wrongly assumed the asymptotes are always $y = \\pm x$ for any hyperbola. The asymptote equation depends on the relationship between $a$ and $b$, which is related to the given eccentricity. \nStudent：zzc",
