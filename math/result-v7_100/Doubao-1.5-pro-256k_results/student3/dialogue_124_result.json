    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose D.\nTeacher：Remember the definitions of odd and even functions. For an odd function \\(y = f(x)\\), \\(f(-x)= - f(x)\\), and for an even function \\(y = g(x)\\), \\(g(-x)=g(x)\\). How do you calculate \\(|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)|\\) based on these properties?\nStudent：Using the properties, \\(|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = |(-f(x)) \\cdot g(x)| = | - f(x)g(x) | = |f(x)g(x)|\\).\nTeacher：You're incorrect. The correct property for an odd - function product should result in a change of sign. Here, you showed \\(|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)|\\), which indicates an even - function property, not an odd - function one as required for option D.\nStudent：Okay.\nTeacher：You mistook the property of an odd function for the expression \\(|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|\\). An odd function should satisfy \\(h(-x)= - h(x)\\), but you showed it satisfies the even - function property \\(h(-x)=h(x)\\). Do you understand this error?\nStudent：Yes, I understand the specific error you pointed out.\nTeacher：Great. If you have any other questions or need further clarification on similar concepts, feel free to ask.\nStudent：Thank you, I will review these parity concepts more thoroughly. If I have more questions, I'll ask!\nTeacher：You're welcome. If you come across any other problems related to function parity, don't hesitate to bring them up. Just remember to apply the correct definitions of odd and even functions accurately.\nStudent：Okay, thank you! I'll be sure to use the definitions directly next time.\nTeacher：You're welcome. If you encounter new function - parity problems, start by clearly writing out the expressions for \\(h(-x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) using the odd/even properties of the component functions and then compare them. Keep practicing!\nStudent：Okay, thank you! I'll practice applying the definitions directly next time.\nTeacher：You seem to have a good understanding now. If you have a new function - parity problem to work through, you can present it, and we can go over it together.\nStudent：Okay! If I find another function parity problem, I'll ask you for help.\nTeacher：That's great. Remember, when dealing with function parity, always start from the basic definitions of odd and even functions. If you have a new problem, share it with me and we'll analyze it step - by - step.\nStudent：Okay, thank you! I'll definitely do that.\nTeacher：It seems you've grasped the error in the previous problem well. If you encounter a new function - parity question, do start by using the definitions. Are there any new problems you'd like to discuss?\nStudent：Not at the moment! I'll let you know if I find a new one.\nTeacher：That's fine. When you do come across a new function - parity problem, be sure to methodically apply the definitions of odd and even functions. Good luck with your studies. If you think of anything, just let me know.\nStudent：Thank you! I'll be sure to practice the definitions more and reach out if I have other questions.\nTeacher：It's great that you plan to practice more. If you run into any confusion while practicing, like mis - applying the odd/even function definitions again, don't hesitate to come back. Are you confident in applying these definitions correctly now?\nStudent：Yes, I feel more confident now, but I'll make sure to use the definitions directly in practice.\nTeacher：That's wonderful to hear. Keep up the good work. If you do come across any issues during your practice, like getting confused between odd and even function properties again, don't hesitate to ask. Are you ready to try a new function - parity problem?\nStudent：Yes, I'm ready to try a new function-parity problem.\nTeacher：Let's consider this: If \\(y = f(x)\\) is odd and \\(y = g(x)\\) is even, and we have a function \\(h(x)=f(x)+g(x)\\). What is \\(h(-x)\\) based on the odd and even function definitions?\nStudent：We have \\(h(x) = f(x) + g(x)\\), so \\(h(-x) = f(-x) + g(-x)\\). Since \\(f(x)\\) is odd, \\(f(-x) = -f(x)\\), and since \\(g(x)\\) is even, \\(g(-x) = g(x)\\). So, \\(h(-x) = -f(x) + g(x)\\).\nTeacher：Correct. Now, based on the expression for \\(h(-x)= - f(x)+g(x)\\), can you determine if \\(h(x)\\) is odd, even, or neither? How does \\(h(-x)\\) compare to \\(h(x)\\) and \\(-h(x)\\)?\nStudent：Comparing:  \n\\(h(-x) = -f(x) + g(x)\\)  \n\\(h(x) = f(x) + g(x)\\)  \nSo, \\(h(-x) = -f(x) + g(x) \\neq h(x)\\) and \\(h(-x) \\neq -h(x)\\) generally. Thus, it's neither odd nor even in general.\nTeacher：Your analysis is correct. Well done! If you'd like to try another similar problem or have any follow - up questions regarding function parity, feel free to ask.\nStudent：Thank you! I don't have any more questions for now.\nTeacher：Since you've completed this problem successfully and have no further questions, keep up the good work in practicing function parity concepts. If new questions arise, don't hesitate to ask.\nStudent：Thank you! I will keep practicing and come to you if I have more questions.\nTeacher：You're doing well. If you come across a more complex function - parity problem, say with a combination of multiple functions and operations, how would you start analyzing it using the odd and even function definitions?\nStudent：I would start by writing the definitions for each function, like substituting \\(-x\\) for every function component, and then compare it with the original expression to check if the combined result matches the definition for odd, even, or neither.\nTeacher：Your approach is correct. If you want to practice more, I can provide another problem. For example, if \\(y = f(x)\\) is odd, \\(y = g(x)\\) is odd, and \\(h(x)=f(x)g(x)\\), what is the parity of \\(h(x)\\)? How would you start analyzing this using the odd function definition?\nStudent：First, write \\(h(-x) = f(-x)g(-x)\\). Since both \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are odd, \\(f(-x) = -f(x)\\) and \\(g(-x) = -g(x)\\). Thus, \\(h(-x) = (-f(x))(-g(x)) = f(x)g(x) = h(x)\\). So, \\(h(x)\\) is even.\nTeacher：Your conclusion is correct. If you'd like to practice more complex problems or have any questions about the underlying concepts, such as why the product of two odd functions is even, feel free to ask.\nStudent：Thank you! I'll practice more and let you know if I have questions.\nTeacher：It seems you're on the right track with these function - parity problems. If you encounter a problem where one function is odd, one is even, and the combined function involves division, say \\(k(x)=\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\) (\\(g(x)\\neq0\\)), how would you start analyzing the parity of \\(k(x)\\) using the odd and even function definitions?",
