    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I got the maximum value as $2.484$.\nTeacher：Could you share how you transformed the function? For example, did you rewrite $\\sin^{2}x$ using a trigonometric identity? This might help find where the error occurred in getting the value $2.484$.\nStudent：I rewrote $\\sin^2 x$ as part of a completed square: $(\\sin x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 - 1$.\nTeacher：The error is in the incorrect transformation of $\\sin^{2}x$. The correct identity is $\\sin^{2}x = 1 - \\cos^{2}x$, not what you used to create the completed - square form.\nStudent：I don't think I used $1 - \\cos^2 x$ anywhere. I just tried to complete the square with $\\sin x$.\nTeacher：Completing the square with $\\sin x$ in this way is wrong. The function should be rewritten using $\\sin^{2}x = 1 - \\cos^{2}x$ to properly analyze and find the maximum value. What led you to complete the square with $\\sin x$ instead? \nStudent：I saw the $\\sin^2 x$ term and thought completing the square would help, since I'm used to that approach from quadratics.\nTeacher：The key error is that for this trigonometric function, the correct starting point is using the $\\sin^{2}x = 1 - \\cos^{2}x$ identity rather than trying to complete the square directly with $\\sin x$. Why not start with the proper identity? \nStudent：I'm just more familiar with completing the square, so I defaulted to that method without analyzing the function further.\nTeacher：The main mistake is that in a trigonometric function like this, defaulting to completing the square on $\\sin x$ without first using the $\\sin^{2}x = 1 - \\cos^{2}x$ identity is an inappropriate approach.\nStudent：zzc",
