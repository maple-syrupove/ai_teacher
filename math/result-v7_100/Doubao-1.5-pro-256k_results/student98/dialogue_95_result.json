    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is A, 2 - i.\nTeacher：To simplify $\\frac{5i}{1 - 2i}$, we usually multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. Did you forget to multiply by the conjugate of $1 - 2i$ which is $1+2i$ during the simplification process?\nStudent：No, I didn't use the conjugate method.\nTeacher：Then what method did you use? Can you briefly describe the steps you took to get the answer $2 - i$?\nStudent：I divided $5i$ by $1$ to get $5i$, and then $5i$ by $-2i$ to get $-2.5$. Then I combined them to form $2 - i$.\nTeacher：Your mistake is that you can't divide a complex - fraction like that. You can't divide the numerator by each term in the denominator separately. Complex - fraction simplification requires the use of the conjugate method. \nStudent：zzc",
