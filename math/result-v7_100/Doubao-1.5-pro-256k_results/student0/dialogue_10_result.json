What do you think about this transformation?\nStudent：Oh, I didn't try that transformation. I just started differentiating the original expression right away without simplifying it first.\nTeacher：The error was starting to differentiate the original complex form of the function without first simplifying it. Simplifying could have made the process of finding maximum and minimum values much easier.\nStudent：zzc",
