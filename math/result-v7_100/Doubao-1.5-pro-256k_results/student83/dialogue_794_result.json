    "correct_answer": "【Detailed Explanation】(1) We are given the equation $(\\sin B-\\sin C)^{2}=\\sin ^{2} A-\\sin B \\sin C$.\nExpand the left side:\n$\\sin^2 B - 2\\sin B \\sin C + \\sin^2 C = \\sin^2 A - \\sin B \\sin C$.\nRearrange the terms to group the squares on one side:\n$\\sin^2 B + \\sin^2 C - \\sin^2 A = 2\\sin B \\sin C - \\sin B \\sin C$\n$\\sin^2 B + \\sin^2 C - \\sin^2 A = \\sin B \\sin C$.\n\nBy the Law of Sines, $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C} = k$. So, $\\sin A = a/k, \\sin B = b/k, \\sin C = c/k$.\nSubstitute these into the equation:\n$(b/k)^2 + (c/k)^2 - (a/k)^2 = (b/k)(c/k)$.\nMultiply the entire equation by $k^2$:\n$b^2 + c^2 - a^2 = bc$.\n\nFrom the Law of Cosines, we know that $\\cos A = \\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}$.\nSubstitute the result we just found:\n$\\cos A = \\frac{bc}{2bc} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince A is an angle in a triangle, $A \\in (0, \\pi)$. The angle A for which $\\cos A = 1/2$ is $A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\n(2) We are given $\\sqrt{2} a+b=2 c$. Using the Law of Sines again, this becomes:\n$\\sqrt{2}k\\sin A + k\\sin B = 2k\\sin C$.\n$\\sqrt{2}\\sin A + \\sin B = 2\\sin C$.\nWe know $A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and $B = \\pi - (A+C) = \\pi - (\\frac{\\pi}{3}+C)$.\nSo, $\\sin B = \\sin(\\pi - (\\frac{\\pi}{3}+C)) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}+C) = \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\cos C + \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\sin C = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos C + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin C$.\n\nSubstitute $\\sin A = \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and the expression for $\\sin B$ into the equation:\n$\\sqrt{2}(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos C + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin C) = 2\\sin C$.\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos C = 2\\sin C - \\frac{1}{2}\\sin C = \\frac{3}{2}\\sin C$.\nMultiply by 2: $\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{3}\\cos C = 3\\sin C$.\n$3\\sin C - \\sqrt{3}\\cos C = \\sqrt{6}$.\n\nWe can solve this using the R-formula, $R\\sin(C-\\alpha)$. Here $R = \\sqrt{3^2 + (-\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{9+3} = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n$2\\sqrt{3}(\\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\sin C - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\cos C) = \\sqrt{6}$.\n$2\\sqrt{3}(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\sin C - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos C) = \\sqrt{6}$.\n$2\\sqrt{3}\\sin(C - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\sqrt{6}$.\n$\\sin(C - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\nSince $A=\\frac{\\pi}{3}$, we have $0 < C < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, so $-\\frac{\\pi}{6} < C-\\frac{\\pi}{6} < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nIn this range, the only solution to $\\sin(C - \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ is $C - \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n$C = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{3\\pi+2\\pi}{12} = \\frac{5\\pi}{12}$.\n\nWe need to find $\\sin C = \\sin(\\frac{5\\pi}{12})$.\n$\\sin(\\frac{5\\pi}{12}) = \\sin(75^{\\circ}) = \\sin(45^{\\circ}+30^{\\circ}) = \\sin 45^{\\circ}\\cos 30^{\\circ} + \\cos 45^{\\circ}\\sin 30^{\\circ}$\n$= \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{4}$.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I divided both sides of the equation $\\sqrt{2}a+b=2c$ by $a$ and got $\\sqrt{2}+b/a=2c/a$. Then I didn't know how to continue.\nTeacher：What trigonometric relationships do you think you could use to convert the ratio of sides ($b/a$ and $c/a$) into trigonometric functions? Recall the sine rule which might be relevant here. \nStudent：I know the Law of Sines says $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}$, so $b/a$ could be written as $\\sin B/\\sin A$, and $c/a$ as $\\sin C/\\sin A$.\nTeacher：Great. After substituting these into $\\sqrt{2}+b/a = 2c/a$, you'll get an equation with angles. But be careful when substituting. What do you think the new equation will look like? And don't forget the value of $\\sin A$ you found in part (1).\nStudent：After substitution, the equation becomes $\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{\\sin B}{\\sin A} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sin C}{\\sin A}$. Since earlier I found $\\sin A = 1$, it becomes $\\sqrt{2} + \\sin B = 2\\sin C$.\nTeacher：The error is that $\\sin A$ is not equal to $1$. In part (1), from $(\\sin B - \\sin C)^{2}=\\sin ^{2}A-\\sin B\\sin C$, using the sine rule and cosine rule, $\\sin A=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, not $1$. \nStudent：Oh, I see. So after substitution, the equation should be $\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{\\sin B}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sin C}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.\nTeacher：Good. Now, how do you plan to deal with $\\sin B$ in the equation $\\sqrt{2}+\\frac{2\\sin B}{\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{2\\sin C}{\\sqrt{3}}$? Remember the relationship between angles in a triangle $A + B + C=\\pi$. What can you do with $\\sin B$ based on this?\nStudent：I can express $\\sin B$ as $\\sin(\\pi - A - C)$, which equals $\\sin(A + C)$.\nTeacher：Very good. Then when you substitute $\\sin B=\\sin(A + C)$ into the equation $\\sqrt{2}+\\frac{2\\sin B}{\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{2\\sin C}{\\sqrt{3}}$, what should you be cautious about when expanding $\\sin(A + C)$? Recall the formula for $\\sin(A + C)$.\nStudent：I need to use the formula $\\sin(A+C) = \\sin A \\cos C + \\cos A \\sin C$ when substituting and expanding.\nTeacher：Correct. Now, when you substitute $\\sin B=\\sin A\\cos C+\\cos A\\sin C$ into the equation, which values of $\\sin A$ and $\\cos A$ should you use? Remember the value of angle $A$ you found in part (1).\nStudent：Since in part (1), we found $A = 120^\\circ$, so $\\sin A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\\cos A = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTeacher：Good. When substituting these values into the equation $\\sqrt{2}+\\frac{2(\\sin A\\cos C+\\cos A\\sin C)}{\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{2\\sin C}{\\sqrt{3}}$, make sure to correctly apply the arithmetic operations. What do you think might be a common error during this substitution and simplification process?\nStudent：A common error could be not distributing the coefficients correctly or making mistakes when combining like terms after substitution.\nTeacher：That's a valid concern. Now, when you start the substitution and simplification, what terms do you think will be the most challenging to handle due to the presence of both $\\sin C$ and $\\cos C$ terms?\nStudent：I think the terms involving both $\\sin C$ and $\\cos C$ together, like $\\cos A \\sin C$ or $\\sin A \\cos C$, will be the hardest to combine and isolate for $\\sin C$.\nTeacher：That's a good observation. When simplifying, pay close attention to the coefficients of $\\sin C$ and $\\cos C$. What is the first step you would take to start isolating $\\sin C$ in the equation after substitution?\nStudent：The first step I'd take is to expand the numerator: $2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos C-\\frac{1}{2}\\sin C\\right)$, then distribute and collect like terms.\nTeacher：That's the right approach. When distributing the 2 in $2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cos C-\\frac{1}{2}\\sin C\\right)$, be careful not to make arithmetic mistakes with the coefficients. What do you get after distributing?\nStudent：After distributing, I get $\\sqrt{3} \\cos C - \\sin C$ in the numerator.\nTeacher：Good. Now, when you rewrite the equation with this distributed form, what should you be careful about when moving terms around to isolate $\\sin C$? Remember, keep the equation balanced.\nStudent：I need to make sure I subtract or add the correct terms to both sides when moving the $\\sin C$ and $\\cos C$ terms, so I don’t lose or mix up any coefficients.\nTeacher：Correct. As you start to move terms around in the equation $\\sqrt{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}\\cos C - \\sin C}{\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{2\\sin C}{\\sqrt{3}}$, what do you think is the first operation to perform to clear the fraction?\nStudent：The first operation would be to multiply both sides of the equation by $\\sqrt{3}$ to eliminate the denominators.\nTeacher：Good. When multiplying by $\\sqrt{3}$, be careful to distribute it to every term on both sides of the equation. What do you think could go wrong during this distribution?\nStudent：I might accidentally forget to multiply one of the terms, or incorrectly multiply, which would cause errors in the coefficients of $\\sin C$ or $\\cos C$.\nTeacher：That's correct. When distributing $\\sqrt{3}$, double - check each term's coefficient. After distribution, what will the left - hand side of the equation look like?\nStudent：After distributing, the left-hand side becomes $\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{3}\\cos C - \\sin C$.\nTeacher：Good. Now, when you set this equal to the right - hand side and start combining like terms to isolate $\\sin C$, what should you be cautious about regarding the coefficients of $\\sin C$? Remember, the right - hand side is $2\\sin C$.\nStudent：I should make sure to move the $-\\sin C$ from the left side to the right, so all $\\sin C$ terms are together, and correctly add the coefficients.\nTeacher：Correct. Just be very careful with the arithmetic when adding the coefficients of $\\sin C$. After moving the terms, what will the equation look like?\nStudent：After moving the $-\\sin C$ to the right, the equation becomes $\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{3}\\cos C = 2\\sin C + \\sin C$.\nTeacher：That's correct so far. Now, when combining the $\\sin C$ terms on the right - hand side, be careful not to make any arithmetic mistakes with the coefficients. What do you get when you combine them?\nStudent：When I combine them, I get $2\\sin C + \\sin C = 3\\sin C$.\nTeacher：Good. Now, you have $\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{3}\\cos C = 3\\sin C$. To solve for $\\sin C$, what do you think is the next step? Keep in mind the relationship between $\\sin C$ and $\\cos C$ might help here.\nStudent：I think the next step is to express $\\cos C$ in terms of $\\sin C$ using the identity $\\sin^2 C + \\cos^2 C = 1$, then substitute and solve for $\\sin C$.\nTeacher：That's a valid approach. But when using $\\cos C=\\pm\\sqrt{1 - \\sin^{2}C}$, be careful which sign to choose. Remember the context of the triangle angles. Which sign do you think is appropriate here?\nStudent：I think since $C$ is an angle in a triangle, and $0 < C < \\pi$, $\\cos C$ could be positive or negative depending on the value of $C$—but since $A=120^\\circ$, the sum $B+C=60^\\circ$, so $C<60^\\circ$ and $\\cos C>0$.\nTeacher：Correct thinking. When substituting $\\cos C = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^{2}C}$ into $\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{3}\\cos C = 3\\sin C$, be very careful with the algebraic manipulations, especially when squaring both sides to get rid of the square root. What do you think might be a common error during this squaring process?",
