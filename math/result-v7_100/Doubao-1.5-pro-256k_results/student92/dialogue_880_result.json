    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C. $(0,2]$ as the answer.\nTeacher：For the function $y = 2^{u}$, it is an increasing function. If $f(x)=2^{x(x - a)}$ is decreasing on $(0,1)$, then $u = x(x - a)=x^{2}-ax$ should be decreasing on $(0,1)$. The axis of symmetry of $u=x^{2}-ax$ is $x=\\frac{a}{2}$. Have you considered the relationship between the axis of symmetry and the interval $(0,1)$ correctly? \nStudent：I did not consider the axis of symmetry when analyzing this problem.\nTeacher：The error is that you failed to use the property that for an exponential - composite function \\(y = 2^{u}\\) with \\(y\\) increasing, \\(u=x^{2}-ax\\) must be decreasing on \\((0,1)\\), and this is related to the position of the axis of symmetry \\(x = \\frac{a}{2}\\) of the quadratic function \\(u=x^{2}-ax\\). \nStudent：zzc",
