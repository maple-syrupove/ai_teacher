    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$\nTeacher：First, solve the inequality in set $B$. For $3 - 2x>0$, we get $2x < 3$, so $x < \\frac{3}{2}$. Now, consider the elements in set $A$ where $x < 2$. Do you notice how elements that satisfy $x < \\frac{3}{2}$ are also in set $A$? How can $A\\cap B$ be empty?\nStudent：Because I thought that since set A is $x < 2$ and B is $x < \\frac{3}{2}$, and I just took A's condition.\nTeacher：The error is that you wrongly assumed the intersection should be based only on set A's condition. For the intersection $A\\cap B$, elements must satisfy both set A's and set B's conditions. Since $x < \\frac{3}{2}$ satisfies both, $A\\cap B$ is not empty. \nStudent：zzc",
