    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C, so $a=1$.\nTeacher：Can you explain the reasoning behind choosing \\(a = 1\\)? How did you use the property of an even function \\(f(x)=f(-x)\\) in this problem?\nStudent：I mainly saw that $a=1$ looked the most natural, so I picked it. I didn't use $f(x)=f(-x)$ directly in my process.\nTeacher：The error is that you made a random choice without using the key property of an even function \\(f(x) = f(-x)\\) to solve for the value of \\(a\\).
