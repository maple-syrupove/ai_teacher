    "question": "8. (5 points) The Chinese mathematician Chen Jingrun achieved world-leading results in the study of Goldbach's Conjecture. Goldbach's Conjecture states that 'every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes', for example, $30=7+23$. If two distinct numbers are randomly selected from the prime numbers not exceeding 30, what is the probability that their sum is 30?

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option A, $\\frac{1}{45}$.\nTeacher：Can you tell me how you counted the total number of ways to select two distinct prime numbers from those not exceeding 30? And also, how did you determine the number of pairs that sum to 30?\nStudent：For the total ways, I counted the number of primes ≤30, which are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 (so 10 in total). Selecting 2 distinct ones, that’s C(10,2) = 45. For pairs summing to 30, I found 5 and 25, but 25 isn’t prime, so I only got one, (7,23).\nTeacher：The error is that you wrongly considered 25 as a prime number when looking for pairs that sum to 30. In fact, 25 is a composite number.\nStudent：That’s true, but after realizing 25 isn’t prime, I only kept (7, 23) as the valid pair.\nTeacher：Then the error might be in your calculation of the probability formula. Remember, probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the number of total outcomes. You correctly found 1 favorable outcome, but check if you used the total outcomes correctly in the formula. \nStudent：Yes, for the total number of outcomes, I used C(10,2) = 45, so my probability was 1/45.\nTeacher：The error is that the options given in the question are $\\frac{1}{12}$, $\\frac{1}{14}$, $\\frac{1}{15}$, $\\frac{1}{18}$, but you got $\\frac{1}{45}$. Check if there was a miscalculation in your combination formula or in reducing the fraction. \nStudent：I used C(10,2) = 45 as the total number of ways, so I don't see a miscalculation there.\nTeacher：Check if you've accounted for all prime - number pairs that sum to 30. Maybe there are more pairs you overlooked, not just (7, 23), which would affect the numerator of the probability fraction. \nStudent：I only checked (5,25) and (7,23). After realizing 25 isn’t prime, I didn’t check for any other pairs.\nTeacher：The error is that you didn't fully search for all prime - number pairs that sum to 30. There could be other valid pairs apart from the ones you initially considered.\nStudent：zzc",
