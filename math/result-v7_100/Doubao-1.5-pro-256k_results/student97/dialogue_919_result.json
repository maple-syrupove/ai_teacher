If the teacher states an error that does not match your actual mistake, you should deny it and wait for the teacher's next question. If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly.

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to solve by comparing their volumes directly, but I couldn't find r, so I couldn't get an answer.\nTeacher：Rather than comparing volumes directly, you should start with the formula for lateral - surface area. How did you set up the equation using the equal - lateral - surface - area condition?\nStudent：I didn't set up an equation for the lateral areas. I just focused on the volume formulas and tried to compare those.\nTeacher：The error is that you should have started with the equal lateral - surface area condition by setting up an equation using the lateral - surface area formulas for the cylinder and cone, not just focusing on the volume formulas.\nStudent：zzc",
