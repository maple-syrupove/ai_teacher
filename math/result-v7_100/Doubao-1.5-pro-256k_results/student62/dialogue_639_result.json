    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose option C, $c < a < b$.\nTeacher：Let's think about the range of logarithmic and exponential functions. For the logarithm $a = \\log _{2}0.2$, what do you know about the value of $\\log _{2}x$ when $x$ is between $0$ and $1$?\nStudent：When $x$ is between $0$ and $1$, $\\log_{2}x$ is negative.\nTeacher：Since $\\log _{2}x$ is negative when $0 < x < 1$, $a=\\log _{2}0.2<0$. And for exponential functions, $b = 2^{0.2}>1$ as the base $2>1$, and $0 < c = 0.2^{0.3}<1$. You seem to have misjudged the relative size of $a$ and $c$. \nStudent：I thought $c$ would be greater than $a$ because $c$ looked bigger.\nTeacher：Your mistake is that you made a judgment based on appearance rather than using the properties of logarithmic and exponential functions to accurately compare the values of $a$ and $c$. Given $a<0$ and $0 < c < 1$, clearly $a < c$. \nStudent：zzc",
