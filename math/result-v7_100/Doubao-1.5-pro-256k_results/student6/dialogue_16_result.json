    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：φ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：Can you recall the rule for horizontal shift of a trigonometric function? How does shifting \\(y = \\cos(2x+\\phi)\\) to the right by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) units change the function?\nStudent：Shifting it to the right by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) means replacing \\(x\\) with \\(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), so it becomes \\(y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi)\\).\nTeacher：Good. Now, simplify \\(\\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2})+\\phi)\\). What trigonometric identities do you think you should use during the simplification process?\nStudent：I would expand it to \\(\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)\\), but I didn't think of using any identities.\nTeacher：After getting \\(\\cos(2x - \\pi+\\phi)\\), you should use the identity \\(\\cos(A - B)=\\cos A\\cos B+\\sin A\\sin B\\) or the co - function identities. For \\(\\cos(2x - \\pi+\\phi)\\), you could rewrite it to match the form of \\(\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})\\). What co - function identity might be relevant here? \nStudent：I'm not sure which co-function identity to use in this case.\nTeacher：One relevant co - function identity is \\(\\cos(\\alpha-\\pi)=-\\cos\\alpha\\). So \\(\\cos(2x - \\pi+\\phi)=-\\cos(2x+\\phi)\\). Do you know how to further transform it to match \\(\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})\\)? \nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：Another identity is \\(\\cos\\theta=\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\). So \\(-\\cos(2x+\\phi)=\\sin(2x+\\phi-\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\). You seem to be having trouble connecting this transformed form with \\(\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})\\).\nStudent：Yes, I'm not sure how to directly set up the equation or relate those two expressions.\nTeacher：Since \\(\\sin(2x+\\phi - \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\) coincides with \\(\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})\\), you should set up the equation \\(\\phi-\\frac{\\pi}{2}=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2k\\pi\\) or \\(\\phi-\\frac{\\pi}{2}=\\pi - (\\frac{\\pi}{3})+2k\\pi\\), \\(k\\in Z\\). Your error is not knowing how to establish the equality relationship based on the identity. \nStudent：zzc",
