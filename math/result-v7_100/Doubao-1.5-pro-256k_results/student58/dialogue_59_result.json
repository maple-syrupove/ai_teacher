    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is $y = 3x$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you calculated the derivative of the function $y = 3(x^{2}+x)e^{x}$ to find the slope of the tangent line?\nStudent：I didn't actually calculate the derivative. I just took the '3' and used it as the slope.\nTeacher：The error is that you cannot simply take the coefficient 3 as the slope.
