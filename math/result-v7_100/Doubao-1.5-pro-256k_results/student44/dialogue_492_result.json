    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I got $b^2 = -4a^2$, which doesn't make sense, so I couldn't find the eccentricity.\nTeacher：How did you arrive at $b^{2}=-4a^{2}$? What specific relationships between $a$, $b$, and the given points (like coordinates of $A$, $B$, $F$) did you use in your calculations?\nStudent：I assumed $A$ was at $(a,0)$ and $B$ at $(a,3a)$, since the slope of $AB$ is 3, then plugged $B$ into the hyperbola equation.\nTeacher：Your error is that you wrongly assumed the coordinates of point $B$. Just because the slope of $AB$ is 3 doesn't mean $B$ is at $(a,3a)$. $B$ lies on the hyperbola and $BF$ is perpendicular to the $x$-axis, so its $x$-coordinate should be the $x$-coordinate of the right focus $F$. \nStudent：zzc",
