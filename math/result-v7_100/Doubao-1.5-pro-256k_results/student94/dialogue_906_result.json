Just choosing one point may not guarantee it's the minimum for \\(z = x - 5y\\).\nStudent：I just tried plugging in \\(x=2, y=0\\) because it was easy to check. I didn't check all the vertices.\nTeacher：Your error is that you assumed one randomly - chosen point \\((2,0)\\) gives the minimum value of \\(z=x - 5y\\) without checking all the corner points of the feasible region.
