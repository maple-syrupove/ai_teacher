    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：2\nTeacher：Can you explain how you arrived at the value of 2 for |z₁ - z₂|? What approach or formula did you use?\nStudent：I saw that both |z₁| and |z₂| are 2, so I assumed their difference would also have modulus 2, without considering other constraints.\nTeacher：Let me ask, did you consider the given condition that z₁ + z₂ = √3 + i when calculating |z₁ - z₂|? How might this affect the result?\nStudent：I didn't actually use the sum condition. I focused only on the modulus of z₁ and z₂.\nTeacher：Did you think about how the sum z₁ + z₂ = √3 + i might relate to the positions of z₁ and z₂ in the complex plane? How could this influence their difference?\nStudent：No, I didn't think much about how their positions, based on the sum, would affect the difference between them.\nTeacher：Have you considered that the sum z₁ + z₂ = √3 + i implies a specific geometric relationship between z₁ and z₂ in the complex plane? How might this impact |z₁ - z₂|?\nStudent：I didn't realize that the sum would create a specific geometric constraint. I only focused on their individual moduli.\nTeacher：I'm glad we're clarifying this. Did you consider using any specific identity or formula involving the moduli and the sum to find |z₁ - z₂|?\nStudent：No, I didn't use any identity or formula involving the moduli and the sum. I just assumed the answer.\nTeacher：Understood. It seems your mistake lies in ignoring the given sum z₁ + z₂ = √3 + i and focusing solely on the individual moduli of z₁ and z₂ when calculating |z₁ - z₂|.\nStudent：zzc",
