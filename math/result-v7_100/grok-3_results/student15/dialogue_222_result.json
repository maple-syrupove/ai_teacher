    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose none of the options and left it blank.\nTeacher：Can you explain why you decided to leave the answer blank? What part of the problem caused you difficulty?\nStudent：I substituted $|a|=2|b|$ into a formula involving $\\cos\\theta$, but got $\\cos\\theta=2$, which didn't match any option.\nTeacher：Could you clarify how you arrived at cosθ = 2? What specific formula or relationship did you use in your calculation?\nStudent：I used the formula $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{|a|}{|b|}$, substituting $|a| = 2|b|$, which gave $\\cos\\theta = 2$.\nTeacher：I see. Can you think about what the formula cosθ = |a|/|b| represents? Does it correctly apply to the angle between two vectors in this context?\nStudent：I thought it applied to the angle, but now I'm not sure. I used it because I saw the magnitudes $|a|$ and $|b|$.\nTeacher：Can you recall the correct formula for finding the angle between two vectors? Does it involve just the magnitudes, or something else?\nStudent：The correct formula is $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{a\\cdot b}{|a||b|}$. It involves both the dot product and the magnitudes.\nTeacher：Thank you for recalling that. Does using only the magnitudes in your earlier approach align with this formula for the angle between vectors?\nStudent：No, it doesn't. The correct formula requires the dot product, not just the magnitudes.\nTeacher：I’m glad you recognize that. Your mistake was using cosθ = |a|/|b|, which is not the correct formula for the angle between vectors.\nStudent：zzc",
