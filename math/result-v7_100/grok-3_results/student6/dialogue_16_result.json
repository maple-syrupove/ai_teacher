    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：φ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：Can you explain why you think φ cannot be solved? What specific part of the problem is causing you difficulty?\nStudent：Because the two functions are different types: one is cosine and one is sine, so I can't directly set up an equation to solve for φ.\nTeacher：I see. Are you assuming that cosine and sine functions can't be related through a phase shift? Let me ask, do you recall any trigonometric identities that connect sine and cosine?\nStudent：I think of the basic identities like $\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta = 1$, but I'm not sure about one that directly connects $\\sin\\theta$ and $\\cos\\theta$ through a phase shift.\nTeacher：Understood. Are you aware of any identity that expresses sine in terms of cosine, or vice versa, with a specific angle adjustment?\nStudent：I can't recall an identity that directly expresses $\\sin\\theta$ as a function of $\\cos\\theta$ with a shifted angle.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining your thought process. Have you considered whether sine and cosine might be related through a specific phase difference, such as a quarter turn?\nStudent：I haven't considered that. I wasn't sure how a phase difference could help relate them.\nTeacher：I understand. Could you clarify if you recall that sine and cosine are essentially the same function, just offset by a specific angle?\nStudent：I didn't think of that connection; I considered them as completely different functions.\nTeacher：I see. Are you aware that sine and cosine are related by a phase shift of π/2, such as cos(θ) = sin(θ + π/2)?\nStudent：I don't remember that relationship between cosine and sine with a phase shift of π/2.\nTeacher：I’ve identified your mistake. You are unaware of the fundamental identity that relates cosine and sine through a phase shift, specifically that cos(θ) = sin(θ + π/2).\nStudent：zzc",
