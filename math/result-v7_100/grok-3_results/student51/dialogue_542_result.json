    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I expanded (1 + a x) to get 1 + a x, then expanded (1 + x)^5, and tried to match the x^2 terms. I got a = 0.\nTeacher：Can you tell me how you identified the x^2 term in the expansion of (1 + a x)(1 + x)^5? What specific terms did you multiply to get x^2?\nStudent：I took the x^2 term from (1 + x)^5, which is 10x^2, and multiplied it by 1. I also looked at the a x from (1 + a x) and multiplied it by the x term from (1 + x)^5, which is 5x.\nTeacher：Can you explain how multiplying a x by 5x contributes to the x^2 term? What is the result of that multiplication?\nStudent：Multiplying a x by 5x gives 5a x^2, which is another contribution to the x^2 term in the expansion.\nTeacher：So, you have 10x^2 from (1 + x)^5 multiplied by 1, and 5a x^2 from a x multiplied by 5x. How did you combine these to find the coefficient of x^2?\nStudent：I added them together to get (10 + 5a)x^2, and set 10 + 5a = 5 to solve for a.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined that 10 + 5a equals 5? What steps did you take to solve for a from that equation?\nStudent：I set the sum of the coefficients, 10 + 5a, equal to 5 because the problem states the coefficient of x^2 should be 5. Then I solved 10 + 5a = 5 and got a = -1.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining your steps. I can now see the error. You correctly set up the equation 10 + 5a = 5, but solving it, you got a = -1, which seems inconsistent with your earlier statement of a = 0. This is the mistake in your calculation.\nStudent：No, that's not where I made my mistake.\nTeacher：Understood. Can you clarify where you think the error occurred in your process of identifying the coefficient of x^2 or solving the equation?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：Thank you for being honest. Can you walk me through how you initially concluded a = 0, before solving 10 + 5a = 5? What led to that result?\nStudent：I only looked at the x^2 term from (1 + x)^5 and ignored combining other terms. That's how I got a = 0.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. I can now see the mistake. Your error was in initially ignoring the contribution of other terms, like a x multiplied by 5x, when calculating the coefficient of x^2, which led to concluding a = 0.\nStudent：zzc",
