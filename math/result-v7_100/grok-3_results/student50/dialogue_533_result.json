    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $y= \\pm x$\nTeacher：Thank you for your answer. Can you explain how you determined that the asymptotes are y = ±x? What relationship or formula did you use to connect the eccentricity to the asymptotes?\nStudent：I remembered that for a standard hyperbola, the asymptotes are $y = \\pm x$, so I chose that. I didn't use any specific formula connecting eccentricity to the asymptotes.\nTeacher：I appreciate your honesty. Can you recall if there's a specific property of a hyperbola that relates the slopes of the asymptotes to the values of a and b in the equation?\nStudent：Yes, the slopes of the asymptotes for $\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$ are $\\pm \\frac{b}{a}$.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. How did you use the eccentricity value of $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ in relation to finding the slopes $\\pm \\frac{b}{a}$ for the asymptotes?\nStudent：I didn’t actually use the eccentricity value at all when I chose my answer.\nTeacher：Thank you for your honesty. Can you think of any reason why the eccentricity might be relevant to determining the slopes of the asymptotes?\nStudent：I think the eccentricity gives information about the relationship between $a$ and $b$, which could affect the slope.\nTeacher：Thank you for considering that. Can you specify how the eccentricity relates to $a$ and $b$ in a hyperbola, and why that might influence the slope of the asymptotes?\nStudent：The eccentricity $e$ of a hyperbola is given by $e = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{b^2}{a^2}}$. This relates $a$ and $b$, so it helps to find the slope $\\frac{b}{a}$.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining that. How did you apply this relationship between eccentricity, $a$, and $b$ when selecting your answer for the asymptotes?\nStudent：I actually didn't apply the relationship at all; I just chose the answer based on my memory of $y = \\pm x$ for hyperbolas.\nTeacher：Thank you for your honesty. I'm now clear on the issue. The mistake lies in not using the given eccentricity to calculate the slope of the asymptotes, which is crucial for this problem.\nStudent：zzc",
