    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined the minimum and maximum values of the function on the given interval?\nStudent：I looked at $\\cos x + (x+1)\\sin x$ and tried to write it in the form $A\\sin x+B\\cos x+C$, then used the formula for extrema: from $- \\sqrt{A^2+B^2} + C$ to $ \\sqrt{A^2+B^2} + C$.\nTeacher：How did you express the function in the form $A\\sin x + B\\cos x + C$, specifically handling the $(x+1)\\sin x$ term?\nStudent：I treated $(x+1)\\sin x$ as $x\\sin x + \\sin x$, so I set $A=1+ x$ for the sine term and $B=1$ for the cosine term, and $C=1$.\nTeacher：How do you justify treating $x$ as a constant in the coefficient of $\\sin x$ when $x$ is the variable in the function?\nStudent：I thought that for each fixed $x$, $A$ could be considered as $x+1$, so I proceeded as if it were constant for the purpose of the formula.\nTeacher：Are you assuming that the coefficient of $\\sin x$, which includes $x$, can be treated as a constant across the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$? How does this align with $x$ being a variable?\nStudent：I assumed it was acceptable because for any specific $x$, the coefficient seems fixed, so I used the extrema formula as if the coefficients were constants.\nTeacher：Does treating the coefficient $x+1$ as constant for all $x$ in $[0, 2\\pi]$ account for the fact that it actually changes with $x$? How does this impact your application of the extrema formula?\nStudent：I guess it doesn’t account for the change, but I still applied the formula as if $x+1$ were fixed at each $x$.\nTeacher：Is it possible that treating the variable coefficient $x+1$ as a constant overlooks how it varies with $x$, potentially affecting the accuracy of the extrema formula?\nStudent：Yes, that's possible, since $x+1$ changes as $x$ varies in $[0, 2\\pi]$, so the formula may not apply directly.\nTeacher：Does assuming a constant coefficient for $\\sin x$ fully capture the behavior of the function, given that $x+1$ is not constant over the interval?\nStudent：No, it doesn't fully capture the behavior because $x+1$ actually changes as $x$ changes.\nTeacher：I'm glad you're recognizing this. The mistake lies in treating the coefficient $x+1$ as a constant when applying the extrema formula for $A\\sin x + B\\cos x$. Since $x+1$ varies with $x$, this approach is incorrect.\nStudent：zzc",
