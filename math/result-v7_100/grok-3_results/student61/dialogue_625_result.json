    "question": "8. (5 points) The Chinese mathematician Chen Jingrun achieved world-leading results in the study of Goldbach's Conjecture. Goldbach's Conjecture states that 'every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes', for example, $30=7+23$. If two distinct numbers are randomly selected from the prime numbers not exceeding 30, what is the probability that their sum is 30?

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I got P = 1/45, so I chose option A.\nTeacher：Can you tell me how many prime numbers not exceeding 30 you considered when calculating the probability?\nStudent：I considered the prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. So that's 10 primes.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. How did you determine the total number of ways to select two distinct primes from these 10 numbers?\nStudent：I calculated the total number of pairs as $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$.\nTeacher：Understood. How did you identify the number of favorable pairs that sum to 30?\nStudent：I looked for pairs that I thought could add up to 30 among the primes, and found (7,23) as one valid pair.\nTeacher：Thank you. Did you check for any other pairs of primes that sum to 30, or did you stop after finding (7,23)?\nStudent：I stopped after finding (7,23) and didn't check for other pairs.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining. Did you consider that there might be more pairs of distinct primes summing to 30 beyond just (7,23)?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider that there might be more pairs; I just found the one pair and stopped.\nTeacher：Thank you for your honesty. It seems your mistake was assuming there was only one pair of distinct primes summing to 30, without thoroughly checking for others.\nStudent：zzc",
