    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Let $|\\vec{b}|=x$. Since $|\\vec{a}|=1$, and $|2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b}|=\\sqrt{10}$, I try $|2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b}|^2=(2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b})\\cdot(2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b})=10$.\nTeacher：Can you elaborate on how you expanded the dot product expression for $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2$? What terms did you include in that calculation?\nStudent：I expanded it as $|2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b}|^2 = 4|\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2 = 10$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you determined the term involving the dot product, specifically the coefficient of \\(\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}\\)?\nStudent：Yes. When expanding $(2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b})\\cdot(2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b})$, the cross term is $2 \\times (-\\vec{b}) \\cdot (2\\vec{a}) = -4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$.\nTeacher：Can you clarify how you calculated the coefficient for the cross term in the expansion? Specifically, why did you use 2 and -1 in that step?\nStudent：Because when expanding $(2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b})\\cdot(2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b})$, the cross terms are $2\\vec{a}\\cdot(-\\vec{b})$ and $(-\\vec{b})\\cdot2\\vec{a}$, each giving $-2\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$, so together $-4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining. Can you double-check the calculation of the cross terms? Specifically, how did you combine them to get the coefficient of -4 for \\(\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}\\)?\nStudent：Sure. The cross terms are $2\\vec{a}\\cdot(-\\vec{b}) = -2\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$ and $(-\\vec{b})\\cdot 2\\vec{a} = -2\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$, so they add up to $-4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$.\nTeacher：Thank you for the clarification. Can you reconsider the combination of the cross terms? Are you sure that each term individually contributes -2, leading to a total of -4 for \\(\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}\\)?\nStudent：Yes, each cross term results in $-2\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$, so adding both gives $-4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}$.\nTeacher：Thank you for your persistence. I’ve identified the error. In calculating the cross terms of \\((2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}) \\cdot (2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b})\\), you doubled the coefficient incorrectly. The correct cross term coefficient should be -4, but let’s confirm your understanding.\nStudent：Okay, so the correct coefficient for the cross term is indeed -4.\nTeacher：I'm glad you acknowledge that. To confirm, the error was in the initial expansion of the cross terms, but you've now agreed the coefficient is -4. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\nStudent：No, there's nothing else I'd like to discuss at the moment.\nTeacher：Understood.
