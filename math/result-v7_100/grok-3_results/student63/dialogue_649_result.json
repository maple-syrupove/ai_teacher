    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D.\nTeacher：Thank you for your answer. Can you explain why you think option D, \"α and β are perpendicular to the same plane,\" is the necessary and sufficient condition for the planes to be parallel?\nStudent：I thought that if both planes are perpendicular to the same plane, they should be parallel to each other.\nTeacher：I appreciate your reasoning. Can you clarify how being perpendicular to the same plane ensures that the two planes do not intersect at any point?\nStudent：I believed that if two planes are perpendicular to the same plane, they must run in the same direction and never meet, so I thought they couldn’t intersect.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining your thought process. Could you consider whether two planes perpendicular to the same plane could still intersect, perhaps at an angle, rather than being parallel?\nStudent：If both planes are perpendicular to the same plane, I thought they would be parallel, but I’m not sure if that means they can’t intersect at an angle.\nTeacher：Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Can you think of a scenario where two planes are perpendicular to the same plane but still intersect with each other?\nStudent：If two planes are perpendicular to the same plane, they might still intersect along a line that is also perpendicular to that third plane.\nTeacher：Thank you for considering that scenario. Could you elaborate on how two planes intersecting along a line while being perpendicular to the same plane affects their parallelism?\nStudent：If two planes intersect along a line, even if both are perpendicular to the same plane, they are not parallel because parallel planes do not intersect.\nTeacher：Thank you for your insight. It seems you've identified a key point. The mistake in choosing option D is that two planes perpendicular to the same plane can still intersect along a line, meaning they are not necessarily parallel.\nStudent：zzc",
