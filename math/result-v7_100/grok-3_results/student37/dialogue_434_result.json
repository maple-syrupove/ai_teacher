    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I answered: cannot be determined.\nTeacher：Thank you for sharing your answer. Can you explain why you think the value of t cannot be determined in this problem?\nStudent：Because after I expanded $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}$, I couldn't see how to eliminate $t$, so I thought it couldn't be solved.\nTeacher：I see. Can you tell me how you expanded $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}$? Specifically, what expression did you get after substituting $\\vec{c}$ in terms of $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$?\nStudent：I wrote $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = \\vec{b} \\cdot (t\\vec{a} + (1-t)\\vec{b}) = t (\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}) + (1-t)(\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b})$.\nTeacher：Thank you for showing your expansion. Can you clarify what values or properties you assigned to $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}$ in your calculation?\nStudent：I didn’t assign any specific values to $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}$ or $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}$; I just left them as they are.\nTeacher：Understood. Did you consider any information given in the problem about the vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ that might help assign values to these dot products?\nStudent：I didn't really consider those properties when I was trying to solve the problem.\nTeacher：I see. Can you recall what specific properties or conditions about vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are provided in the problem statement?\nStudent：The problem says that $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are unit vectors and that the angle between them is $60^\\circ$.\nTeacher：Thank you for recalling that. Did you think about how the angle between $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ might relate to the dot product $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}$?\nStudent：No, I didn’t think about that connection when I was solving it.\nTeacher：I understand. Did you recall the formula that relates the dot product of two vectors to the angle between them?\nStudent：No, I didn’t use that formula during my solution.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. It seems your mistake was not applying the dot product formula that relates $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}$ to the cosine of the angle between the vectors.\nStudent：zzc",
