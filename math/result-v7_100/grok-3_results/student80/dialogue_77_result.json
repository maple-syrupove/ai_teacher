Does it specifically ask for the distance from the vertex, or does it mention another point on the hyperbola?\nStudent：It asks for the distance from the right focus of the hyperbola.\nTeacher：I see now. Thank you for clarifying. You're using the vertex instead of the right focus as requested by the problem. That's the error in your approach.\nStudent：zzc",
