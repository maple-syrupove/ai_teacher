    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is 3.\nTeacher：I'm curious about how you arrived at 3. Can you tell me which asymptote you considered for the distance calculation?\nStudent：I just calculated the distance from the point (3,0) to the origin.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. Could you explain why you chose the origin as a reference point for calculating the distance to the asymptote?\nStudent：Because I remembered calculating distances from points to the origin in previous problems, so I applied that here too.\nTeacher：I see. Can you clarify how calculating the distance to the origin relates to finding the distance to one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola?\nStudent：I thought maybe the asymptote passed through the origin, so I used the origin as the reference.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining. Can you confirm if you identified the equations of the asymptotes of the given hyperbola before calculating the distance?\nStudent：No, I didn't write out the equations of the asymptotes before doing my calculation.\nTeacher：Thank you for your honesty. Did you assume the asymptote's position or direction without deriving its equation first?\nStudent：Yes, I just assumed without actually finding the asymptote’s equation.\nTeacher：I appreciate your response. To clarify, did you calculate the distance from (3,0) to a specific line or point based on that assumption?\nStudent：I calculated the distance from (3,0) to the origin (0,0), not to a specific line.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. It seems your mistake was calculating the distance to the origin instead of to one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola. I'll wait for your thoughts on this.\nStudent：zzc",
