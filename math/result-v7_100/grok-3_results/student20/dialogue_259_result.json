    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to set $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ as unknowns, got $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1$, $a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 2$, and got stuck there.\nTeacher：Can you explain how you defined the terms of the geometric sequence? Did you consider using the common ratio to express them?\nStudent：I let $a_1$ be $a_1$, $a_2$ as $a_2$, $a_3$ as $a_3$, and $a_4$ as $a_4$, treating them as separate unknowns. I didn't use the common ratio.\nTeacher：I see. Did you recognize that in a geometric sequence, each term is related by a common ratio? How might that relationship help simplify your unknowns?\nStudent：I didn't realize that. I just set each term as a separate variable without connecting them using a common ratio.\nTeacher：Understood. Have you considered how defining the terms with a common ratio, like $a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r$ and $a_3 = a_1 \\cdot r^2$, could reduce the number of variables?\nStudent：No, I didn't think to write $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of $a_1$ and $r$. I just kept them as separate unknowns.\nTeacher：I’ve identified your mistake. You treated each term of the geometric sequence as a separate variable instead of relating them through a common ratio. This made the problem more complex than necessary.\nStudent：zzc",
