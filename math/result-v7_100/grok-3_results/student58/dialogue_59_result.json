    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is $y = 3x$.\nTeacher：Could you explain how you determined the slope of the tangent line at the point (0,0)?\nStudent：I saw the coefficient '3' in the original function and used it as the slope for the tangent line.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining your approach. Can you tell me why you think the coefficient '3' directly represents the slope of the tangent line at that point?\nStudent：Because in some linear equations, the number before $x$ represents the slope, so I thought the '3' here was the slope.\nTeacher：I see. Are you assuming that the coefficient in the original function directly gives the slope of the tangent line at any point, including (0,0)?\nStudent：Yes, I thought the coefficient '3' could be used as the slope here.\nTeacher：Understood. Are you aware that the slope of a tangent line to a curve at a specific point is typically found using the derivative of the function at that point?\nStudent：I know that derivatives are used to find slopes, but I wasn't thinking of applying it in this case.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. Did you consider calculating the derivative of the function y=3(x²+x)e^x to find the slope at x=0?\nStudent：No, I didn't calculate the derivative; I just used the '3' from the original equation instead.\nTeacher：I understand. It seems your mistake was assuming the coefficient '3' directly represents the slope of the tangent line at (0,0), instead of calculating the derivative to find the actual slope.\nStudent：zzc",
