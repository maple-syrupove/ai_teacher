    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D.\nTeacher：Can you explain why you think option D is correct? What property of odd and even functions led you to this choice?\nStudent：I thought that since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, multiplying them and then taking the absolute value would give an odd function.\nTeacher：Can you clarify how taking the absolute value of the product affects the symmetry of the function? What happens to the sign of the result when you evaluate it at $-x$?\nStudent：When I evaluate $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ at $-x$, I still get a non-negative value, since absolute value removes the sign.\nTeacher：Can you consider how the absolute value impacts the function's behavior at $x$ and $-x$? Does this maintain the property of an odd function?\nStudent：No, taking the absolute value makes the function always non-negative, so it doesn't maintain the property of an odd function.\nTeacher：Thank you for your insight. Let me ask, does an odd function require that $f(-x) = -f(x)$? How does the absolute value affect this condition?\nStudent：Yes, an odd function requires $f(-x) = -f(x)$. The absolute value removes the sign, so $|f(-x)|$ equals $|f(x)|$.\nTeacher：Given that, do you see how applying the absolute value to the product might prevent the function from satisfying the odd function condition?\nStudent：Yes, applying the absolute value means $|f(-x)\\cdot g(-x)| = |f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$, not $-|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$, so it doesn't satisfy the odd condition.\nTeacher：I see the issue now. Your mistake was assuming that taking the absolute value of the product of an odd and even function would result in an odd function. It does not, as it fails to satisfy $f(-x) = -f(x)$.\nStudent：zzc",
