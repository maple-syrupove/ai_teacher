    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C.\nTeacher：Thank you for your response. Can you explain why you believe the graph of f(x) is symmetric with respect to the line x = π?\nStudent：Because I checked that $f(\\pi-x)=f(x)$, so I thought it was symmetric about $x=\\pi$.\nTeacher：I see. Can you elaborate on how you determined that f(π - x) equals f(x)? What specific steps or properties did you use in your calculation?\nStudent：I used the identity $\\sin(\\pi-x) = \\sin x$, so $f(\\pi-x) = \\sin(\\pi-x) + \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi-x)} = \\sin x + \\frac{1}{\\sin x} = f(x)$.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining your steps. Could you clarify if you considered the domain of the function when applying the identity sin(π - x) = sin x?\nStudent：I only thought about the symmetry property when using the identity. I didn't specifically consider the domain when I checked $f(\\pi-x) = f(x)$.\nTeacher：Understood. Did you evaluate whether the function is defined at all points around x = π when testing for symmetry?\nStudent：No, I didn't check if the function was defined at all points around $x = \\pi$ when testing for symmetry.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. Have you considered if the function f(x) is defined at x = π or nearby points to confirm symmetry about that line?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider whether $f(x)$ is defined exactly at $x = \\pi$ or around it.\nTeacher：Thank you for your response. Let's think about this: is sin(x) defined and non-zero at x = π, which is necessary for f(x) to be defined there?\nStudent：At $x = \\pi$, $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$, so $f(\\pi)$ is not defined.\nTeacher：Thank you for noting that. So, the mistake in your reasoning is that you assumed symmetry about x = π without checking if f(x) is defined at or around that point. Since sin(π) = 0, f(x) is undefined there.\nStudent：zzc",
