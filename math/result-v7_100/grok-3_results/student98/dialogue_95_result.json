    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. 2-i\nTeacher：Can you explain why you chose 2 - i as the answer? What steps did you take to simplify the given complex number expression?\nStudent：I looked at 5i divided by (1-2i) and separated it. I did 5i ÷ 1 and 5i ÷ -2i.\nTeacher：I see. Can you clarify how you handled the division of complex numbers? Did you consider multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator?\nStudent：No, I didn't multiply by the conjugate of the denominator. I just divided the parts directly.\nTeacher：Understood. Did you treat the real and imaginary parts of the denominator separately when dividing, as if they were independent terms?\nStudent：Yes, I divided the numerator by each part of the denominator as if they were separate.\nTeacher：I’m glad you explained your approach. Did you consider that dividing by a complex number isn’t the same as splitting the denominator into parts?\nStudent：No, I didn't think about that. I just split and divided by the parts separately.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. It seems your mistake lies in splitting the denominator into real and imaginary parts and dividing separately, which is not the correct method for dividing complex numbers.\nStudent：zzc",
