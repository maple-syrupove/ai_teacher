    "correct_answer": "Solution: (1) We are given an arithmetic sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ with the first term $a_1 = -7$.\nWe are also given that the sum of the first 3 terms is $S_3 = -15$.\nThe formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$, where $d$ is the common difference.\nFor $n=3$, we have:\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + (3-1)d) = -15$\n$S_3 = \\frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + 2d) = 3(a_1+d) = -15$.\nDivide by 3: $a_1 + d = -5$.\nSubstitute the given value $a_1 = -7$:\n$-7 + d = -5$\n$d = 2$.\n\nThe general term formula for an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\nSubstituting $a_1=-7$ and $d=2$:\n$a_n = -7 + (n-1)2 = -7 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 9$.\n\n(2) To find the formula for $S_n$, we use the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$.\n$S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(-7 + (2n-9)) = \\frac{n}{2}(2n - 16) = n(n-8) = n^2 - 8n$.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $S_n$, we can treat $S_n = n^2 - 8n$ as a quadratic function of $n$. This is an upward-opening parabola. Its minimum value occurs at the vertex.\nThe vertex of a parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is at $x = -b/(2a)$.\nFor our function, the vertex is at $n = -(-8)/(2\\cdot1) = 4$.\nSince $n=4$ is a positive integer, the minimum value of the sequence $S_n$ occurs at $n=4$.\nLet's find the value of $S_4$:\n$S_4 = 4^2 - 8(4) = 16 - 32 = -16$.\nAlternatively, we can complete the square for $S_n$: \n$S_n = n^2 - 8n = (n^2 - 8n + 16) - 16 = (n-4)^2 - 16$.\nThe minimum value of this expression is -16, which occurs when $n=4$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $S_n$ is -16.",

    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer:\nWhen calculating d, I used $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$. So $-15 + 7 = 2d \\rightarrow d = -4$. Then $a_n = -7 -4(n-1) = -4n-3$.\nTeacher：Thank you for sharing your approach. Can you explain why you used the equation $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$ to find the common difference $d$?\nStudent：I thought that $S_3 - a_1$ would give the sum of the next two terms, so I set it equal to $2d$.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. Can you tell me how the sum of an arithmetic sequence is generally calculated, especially for the first three terms?\nStudent：The sum of the first three terms, $S_3$, is calculated as $a_1 + a_2 + a_3$.\nTeacher：Thank you for that. How do $a_2$ and $a_3$ relate to $a_1$ and the common difference $d$ in an arithmetic sequence?\nStudent：$a_2 = a_1 + d$ and $a_3 = a_1 + 2d$.\nTeacher：Thank you. So, using that, what expression would you write for $S_3$ in terms of $a_1$ and $d$?\nStudent：$S_3 = a_1 + (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 2d) = 3a_1 + 3d$.\nTeacher：Thank you. Given that, can you see any difference between the expression you just wrote for $S_3$ and the one you used earlier to find $d$?\nStudent：Yes, I see a difference. Before, I used $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$, but now I see $S_3 = 3a_1 + 3d$.\nTeacher：Thank you for noticing that. Can you pinpoint where your initial approach to finding $d$ might have gone wrong based on this comparison?\nStudent：I used an incorrect equation to relate $S_3$ and $d$, which led to a wrong value for $d$.\nTeacher：Thank you for your insight. I’m confident now that your mistake was in using the incorrect equation $S_3 - a_1 = 2d$ instead of the correct expression for $S_3$. I’ll await your final thoughts.\nStudent：zzc",
