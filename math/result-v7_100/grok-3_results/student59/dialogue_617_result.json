    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：D\nTeacher：Can you explain why you chose option D? What specific reasoning or calculation led you to that conclusion?\nStudent：I thought E was the midpoint of BC, so I used the midpoint formula and got option D.\nTeacher：I see. Let me ask, did you consider the specific role of point E as described in the problem? Where exactly is E located in relation to AD?\nStudent：E is the midpoint of AD, which is the median from A to BC. So E is on the median, halfway between A and D.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. Did you account for the fact that D is the midpoint of BC when determining the position of E relative to B and C?\nStudent：I did not account for D being the midpoint of BC when I first calculated the position of E.\nTeacher：I appreciate your honesty. Did you consider how D being the midpoint of BC affects the vector relationships in the triangle when calculating EB?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider how D being the midpoint of BC would affect the vector relationships when I calculated EB.\nTeacher：Thank you for your response. Can you clarify if you used the definition of a median in your vector calculations for EB?\nStudent：No, I did not use the definition of a median in my vector calculations for EB.\nTeacher：Understood. Based on our discussion, it seems clear that your mistake was not incorporating the definition of a median, specifically that D is the midpoint of BC, into your vector calculations for EB.\nStudent：zzc",
