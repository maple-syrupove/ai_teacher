    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：Insufficient information.\nTeacher：Can you explain why you think there is insufficient information to solve for the magnitude of vector b?\nStudent：Because I couldn't find a way to eliminate all the variables. I only had $|\\vec{a}|=1$, the angle, and $|2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b}|=\\sqrt{10}$, but I couldn't isolate $|\\vec{b}|$.\nTeacher：What specific equations or relationships did you use to try to isolate the magnitude of vector b?\nStudent：I wrote $|2\\vec{a}-\\vec{b}| = \\sqrt{|2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2} = \\sqrt{10}$, but I got stuck there.\nTeacher：Could you clarify how you expanded $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2$ in your equation? I’m curious about the terms you used.\nStudent：Sure. I wrote $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2 = |2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2$.\nTeacher：I see. Can you confirm if the expansion of $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2$ correctly applies the formula for the magnitude of a vector difference?\nStudent：Yes, I used the formula $|\\vec{u} - \\vec{v}|^2 = |\\vec{u}|^2 - 2\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v} + |\\vec{v}|^2$. For $2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}$, I thought $|2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2$.\nTeacher：I’ve identified the error. In expanding $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2$, the middle term should be $-2(2\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}) = -4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$, which you have, but let me confirm if this was applied correctly in further steps. Can you confirm how you proceeded after this expansion?\nStudent：After that, I set $\\sqrt{|2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2} = \\sqrt{10}$, but I didn’t know how to solve for $|\\vec{b}|$ from here.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining. I’ve pinpointed the mistake. In your expansion of $|2\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}|^2$, you correctly wrote $|2\\vec{a}|^2 - 4\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} + |\\vec{b}|^2$, but it seems you may have overlooked substituting known values or relationships. Can you confirm if this is where you stopped?\nStudent：Yes, that's correct. After writing that equation, I didn't see how to substitute or use the angle information, so I stopped.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. I’ve confirmed the error lies in not proceeding to use the given angle between vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ to express $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$ in terms of their magnitudes. I'll await your final thoughts.\nStudent：zzc",
