    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：\\(\\tan\\alpha = \\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\\)\nTeacher：Can you explain why you wrote \\(\\tan\\alpha = \\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\\)? What does \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) represent in this context?\nStudent：I thought that since \\(\\tan(\\alpha - \\frac{5\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{5}\\), if I add \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) to both sides, I could get \\(\\tan\\alpha\\) by just writing \\(\\tan(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5\\pi}{4})\\). I treated \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) as if it were an angle.\nTeacher：I see. Are you assuming that \\(\\tan(a - b) = c\\) implies \\(\\tan(a) = \\tan(c + b)\\)? Is that how tangent functions work with subtraction?\nStudent：Yes, I assumed that if \\(\\tan(a - b) = c\\), then \\(\\tan(a) = \\tan(c + b)\\).\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. Are you certain that the tangent function allows for directly adding angles like that with the given value? Is there a property of tangent that supports this?\nStudent：I thought it would work that way because I was just moving terms like in algebra, but I'm not sure if there's a specific property for tangent that allows this direct addition.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining. Are you aware of how the tangent function behaves with angle subtraction? Does treating it like algebraic addition account for the actual trigonometric identity?\nStudent：I don't think so. I'm not sure how the tangent subtraction identity should be used here.\nTeacher：Thank you for your honesty. Are you familiar with the tangent subtraction formula, and do you think applying it directly might differ from simply adding terms as in algebra?\nStudent：I remember there's a subtraction formula for tangent, but I didn't use it here. I just treated it like algebra and added terms.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. It seems you've identified the issue. Your mistake was treating the tangent function like a simple algebraic equation by directly adding terms, instead of applying the tangent subtraction formula.\nStudent：zzc",
