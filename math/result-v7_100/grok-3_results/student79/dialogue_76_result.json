    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$2\\lambda + 5 \\times 4 = 0$, so $\\lambda = -10$.\nTeacher：Can you explain why you set up the equation $2\\lambda + 5 \\times 4 = 0$ for the vectors to be parallel?\nStudent：I thought that for two vectors to be parallel or perpendicular, we could use such an equation, so I set up $2\\lambda + 5 \\times 4 = 0$.\nTeacher：I see. Could you clarify what specific condition or property of vectors you were applying when you used that equation?\nStudent：I was applying the condition for perpendicular vectors, where the dot product equals zero.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. Are you aware of the correct condition for vectors to be parallel, as opposed to perpendicular?\nStudent：No, I’m not sure what the specific condition for parallel vectors is.\nTeacher：Understood. Can you recall any property or relationship between the components of two vectors that indicates they are parallel?\nStudent：I think parallel vectors have their components in the same ratio, but I’m not sure exactly how to write that as an equation.\nTeacher：Thank you for sharing that. Can you explain what you mean by \"components in the same ratio\" and how you might set up an equation based on that idea?\nStudent：If two vectors are parallel, then their corresponding components are proportional, so $\\dfrac{2}{\\lambda} = \\dfrac{5}{4}$.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining your thought process. Can you clarify how you determined that setting $\\dfrac{2}{\\lambda} = \\dfrac{5}{4}$ represents the condition for parallel vectors?\nStudent：Because if two vectors are parallel, each of their components should have the same ratio, so I set their corresponding component ratios equal to each other.\nTeacher：Thank you for your explanation. Can you confirm if you believe the dot product condition you initially used is relevant to parallel vectors, or if the ratio approach is more appropriate?\nStudent：The ratio approach is more appropriate for parallel vectors; the dot product condition is for perpendicular vectors.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. I’m now certain of the mistake. You initially used the dot product condition, which applies to perpendicular vectors, not parallel ones.\nStudent：zzc",
