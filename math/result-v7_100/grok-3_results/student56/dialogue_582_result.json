    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I couldn't determine the value of $\\sin 2\\alpha$ from the given information.\nTeacher：Can you explain what you think the given equation $\\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\alpha\\right) = \\frac{3}{5}$ implies about angle $\\alpha$ or any related angles?\nStudent：I think it tells me the value of cosine for the angle $\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\alpha$, but I wasn't sure how to find $\\sin\\alpha$ or $\\cos\\alpha$ individually from that.\nTeacher：Have you considered using a trigonometric identity to expand $\\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\alpha\\right)$ in terms of $\\sin \\alpha$ and $\\cos \\alpha$?\nStudent：I thought about expanding it, but I was unsure how that would help me get to $\\sin 2\\alpha$ since I still wouldn't have the exact values for $\\sin\\alpha$ or $\\cos\\alpha$.\nTeacher：Are you familiar with the cosine angle subtraction formula, and how it might express $\\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\alpha\\right)$ using known values for $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$?\nStudent：Yes, I know the formula: $\\cos(A - B) = \\cos A \\cos B + \\sin A \\sin B$, so I wrote $\\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\alpha\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\cos\\alpha + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\sin\\alpha$.\nTeacher：Did you consider how to use this expression, equal to $\\frac{3}{5}$, to find a relationship between $\\sin\\alpha$ and $\\cos\\alpha$?\nStudent：I saw that it forms an equation, but I didn't know how to use it to get the values for $\\sin\\alpha$ or $\\cos\\alpha$ separately.\nTeacher：Have you thought about using the identity $\\sin^2\\alpha + \\cos^2\\alpha = 1$ alongside this equation to solve for the individual terms?\nStudent：I realize I could set up a system, but I wasn’t sure how to solve for both variables with just these two equations.\nTeacher：Did you attempt to substitute one variable in terms of the other using the two equations to simplify the system?\nStudent：No, I didn't try substituting one variable in terms of the other. I wasn't sure how it would lead to $\\sin 2\\alpha$.\nTeacher：Have you considered that $\\sin 2\\alpha$ can be expressed directly using identities involving $\\sin\\alpha$ and $\\cos\\alpha$, even without solving for each separately?\nStudent：Yes, I know that $\\sin 2\\alpha = 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$, but I still didn't see how to get the actual values.\nTeacher：Have you tried using the equation from the cosine expansion and the Pythagorean identity together to find a numerical value for $\\sin 2\\alpha$?\nStudent：No, I didn't try combining those two equations directly to find $\\sin 2\\alpha$.\nTeacher：Did you realize that solving the system of equations from the cosine expansion and the Pythagorean identity could directly lead to finding $\\sin 2\\alpha$ without needing individual values?\nStudent：No, I didn't realize that would allow me to find $\\sin 2\\alpha$ directly.\nTeacher：I see the issue. Your mistake was not recognizing that you can solve for $\\sin 2\\alpha$ directly by using the system of equations from the cosine expansion and the Pythagorean identity together, without needing individual values for $\\sin \\alpha$ and $\\cos \\alpha$.\nStudent：zzc",
