I thought taking the derivative and setting it greater than zero would suffice. Could you point out if there was a specific part I overlooked?\n教师：The error the student made was in using the derivative test to determine the increasing interval without considering the domain of the natural logarithm function.\n学生：So, does that mean that I should have found the domain of $f(x)$ first before checking where the derivative is positive? I only differentiated the whole function and then set it greater than zero without thinking if $f(x)$ was defined there. Is that the main mistake?\n教师：The error the student made lies in not considering the domain of the natural logarithm function before applying the derivative test to determine the increasing interval.\n学生：zzc",
