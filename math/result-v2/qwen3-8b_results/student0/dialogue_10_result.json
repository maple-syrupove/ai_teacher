    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to differentiate $f(x)$ directly to find its extremes, but the calculations got very complicated and I couldn't finish. So, I couldn't find a specific value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student attempted to differentiate the function directly, which is a valid approach, but the complexity of the derivative likely made it difficult to find critical points and ultimately determine $M + m$. \n\nContinuation Protocol: Could you explain why you found the direct differentiation method too complicated?\nStudent：When I tried to differentiate $f(x)$, the numerator had both $(x+1)^2$ and $\\sin x$, and the denominator was $x^2+1$. Doing the quotient rule gave a really messy expression that was hard to simplify. Also, when I tried plugging in values to solve for critical points, the equations got really tough to handle, so I couldn't get the exact maximum or minimum values.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student correctly identified the complexity of differentiating the function directly, but they did not consider that simplifying the expression or analyzing its behavior through alternative methods (such as symmetry or bounding) could have made the problem more manageable.  \n\nContinuation Protocol: Could you explain why you didn’t try to simplify the expression before taking the derivative?\nStudent：I thought about just following the standard procedure to differentiate, since that's what I'm used to doing for these kinds of questions. I didn’t notice any obvious way to simplify the expression, so I focused on applying the quotient rule right away. I guess I wasn't sure how to transform it, and I didn't look for another structure before differentiating.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student relied on the standard procedure of direct differentiation without first exploring whether simplification or analysis of the function’s structure might have made the problem more approachable, which is a missed opportunity for a more efficient solution.\nStudent：That's right. I didn't really try to look for a different structure or simplify the expression before differentiating. I just went straight to the calculation, and the algebra got too complicated for me to manage. Maybe I should have spent some time looking for a transformation, but I didn't know what to look for, so I just used the method I was most familiar with.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student failed to recognize that the function might have a symmetric or simplified structure that could be exploited to find $M + m$ without directly computing the derivative, which led to unnecessary complexity in the calculation.\nStudent：zzc",
