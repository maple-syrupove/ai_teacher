The expression just felt like it would keep the \"oddness\" somehow.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student's error is that they incorrectly believe the absolute value operation preserves the oddness of a function, when in reality, taking the absolute value of an odd function results in an even function. \n\nContinuation Protocol: Can you explain why you thought the absolute value would preserve the oddness of the product $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$?\nStudent：I just kind of went with my gut feeling. I thought maybe since $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ might be odd, taking absolute value wouldn't affect its parity, so I didn't really check by plugging in $-x$.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student's error is that they did not verify their assumption by substituting $-x$ into the function, which is a critical step in determining whether a function is odd or even.\nStudent：Yes, I didn't substitute $-x$ into the function to properly check whether it was odd or even. I just assumed.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student's error is that they failed to systematically verify their assumption by substituting $-x$ into the function, leading to an incorrect conclusion about the parity of $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\nStudent：zzc",
