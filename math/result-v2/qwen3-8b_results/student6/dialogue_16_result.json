So I believed that there isn't enough information to solve for $\\phi$.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student has incorrectly assumed that because the functions are in different trigonometric forms (cosine and sine), it is not possible to relate them algebraically or set up an equation to solve for $\\phi$. In reality, trigonometric identities allow for conversion between sine and cosine, making it possible to equate and solve for $\\phi$. \n\nContinuation Protocol: Please explain why you believe it is not possible to set up an equation to solve for $\\phi$.\nStudent：I thought that since the cosine function's argument is $(2x + \\phi)$ and the sine function's is $(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$, and then the cosine also gets shifted by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, they just look too different to write in a single equation. I couldn't see a way to express both sides in a comparable way, so I thought I couldn't set up an equation to relate $\\phi$ directly.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student has incorrectly assumed that the difference in form between the cosine and sine functions, along with the shift, makes it impossible to equate them algebraically. In reality, the phase shift and trigonometric identities allow for a direct comparison and equation setup to solve for $\\phi$. \n\nContinuation Protocol: Please explain why you believe the difference in form and the shift prevent you from setting up an equation.\nStudent：Because I didn't know how to convert the cosine function into a sine function or the sine into a cosine function, so with the phase shift added on top of that, I couldn't see how to match the two equations and solve for $\\phi$. I thought unless both sides were the same type of function to begin with, I couldn't do anything.\nTeacher：Diagnosis and Statement: The student has incorrectly assumed that it is necessary for both functions to be in the same trigonometric form (e.g., both sine or both cosine) before they can be equated or compared. In reality, trigonometric identities such as $ \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $ allow for conversion between sine and cosine, making it possible to relate the two functions even with a phase shift.\nStudent：zzc",
