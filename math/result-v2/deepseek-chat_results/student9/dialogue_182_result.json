    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $(1,+\\infty)$\nTeacher：Let me analyze your answer step by step. First, to find the monotonically increasing interval of f(x) = ln(x² - 2x - 8), we need to consider two things: the domain of the function and where its derivative is positive. \n\nThe domain requires x² - 2x - 8 > 0. Solving this inequality gives x < -2 or x > 4. \n\nNow, the derivative f'(x) = (2x - 2)/(x² - 2x - 8). For the function to be increasing, f'(x) > 0. \n\nYou chose (1, +∞), but notice that between x = 1 and x = 4, the function isn't even defined (since x must be < -2 or > 4). \n\nYour error is that you considered where the derivative is positive without properly accounting for the function's domain. \n\nThe correct increasing interval is where both the function is defined and the derivative is positive, which is (4, +∞). \n\nYour mistake was selecting an interval where the function isn't defined. \n\nPlease respond with \"zzc\" if you understand, or let me know if you have any questions about why (1, +∞) is incorrect.\nStudent：zzc",
