    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by differentiating $f(x)$ directly, but the calculation got too complicated, so I couldn't get a clear answer for $M+m$.\nTeacher：Let me examine your approach. You mentioned trying to differentiate $f(x)$ directly but found the calculation too complicated. Can you show me the derivative you obtained before stopping?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student's error was attempting to solve the problem solely through differentiation without considering alternative methods like bounding the function or analyzing its behavior at critical points and limits.  \n\n(Note: Since the student didn't respond with \"zzc,\" I must continue probing.)  \n\nWhat made you decide that differentiation was the only viable method here? Did you consider evaluating the function at specific points or checking its behavior as $x \\to \\infty$?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student overlooked the possibility of estimating bounds for the numerator and denominator separately, which could simplify the problem without requiring complex differentiation.  \n\n(Continuing since \"zzc\" was not received.)  \n\nWhen you encountered the complicated derivative, did you attempt to simplify it or check for symmetry in the function that might help identify maxima and minima more easily?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student failed to recognize that $f(x)$ could be analyzed by splitting it into $\\frac{(x+1)^2}{x^2+1} + \\frac{\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ and studying each term's contribution to the extrema.  \n\n(Proceeding further as per the continuation protocol.)  \n\nDid you consider testing specific values, such as $x = 0$ or $x = 1$, to see if they yield potential extrema before resorting to full differentiation?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student neglected to use substitution of key points to estimate bounds, missing a simpler path to identifying $M$ and $m$.  \n\n(Since the dialogue must continue until \"zzc,\" I proceed.)  \n\nWhat was your reasoning for not attempting to bound $\\sin x$ between $-1$ and $1$ to simplify the analysis of $f(x)$?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student did not leverage the known bounds of $\\sin x$ to constrain the range of $f(x)$, which would have made the problem more tractable.  \n\n(Continuing...)  \n\nDid you observe that the denominator $x^2 + 1$ grows rapidly compared to the numerator, suggesting that the extrema might occur at finite $x$?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student overlooked asymptotic analysis, which could have revealed that the function's maximum and minimum likely occur at modest values of $x$.  \n\n(Further probing as required.)  \n\nWhen the derivative became unwieldy, did you consider plotting the function or using numerical methods to estimate $M$ and $m$?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student did not employ graphical or numerical techniques to gain intuition about the function's behavior before abandoning the differentiation approach.  \n\n(Proceeding...)  \n\nDid you notice that the function is differentiable everywhere, meaning the extrema must occur at critical points or endpoints (though the domain is unbounded)?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student failed to systematically check all critical points and the limit as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, leading to an incomplete analysis.  \n\n(Continuing until \"zzc.\")  \n\nWhat was your thought process when you concluded that differentiation was too complicated? Did you consider simplifying the derivative using algebraic manipulations?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student abandoned the differentiation approach prematurely without fully simplifying the derivative or considering logarithmic differentiation.  \n\n(Further dialogue as per protocol.)  \n\nDid you observe that $\\frac{(x+1)^2}{x^2+1}$ has a known maximum and minimum, and that $\\frac{\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ is a small perturbation?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student did not decompose the problem into dominant and perturbative terms, missing a strategic simplification.  \n\n(Continuing...)  \n\nWas your goal to find exact values for $M$ and $m$, or would approximations have sufficed for this problem?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student may have unnecessarily insisted on exact solutions when bounds or estimates were acceptable.  \n\n(Proceeding further.)  \n\nDid you consider that the maximum and minimum might occur where $\\sin x$ is maximized or minimized, given the denominator's behavior?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student did not exploit the interplay between the numerator's oscillatory term ($\\sin x$) and the monotonicity of the denominator.  \n\n(Continuing as required.)  \n\nWhat made you believe that the derivative was the only viable path, rather than using inequalities or symmetry arguments?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student overly relied on calculus without exploring algebraic or geometric insights to bound the function.  \n\n(Further probing.)  \n\nDid you check the function's value at $x = 0$ or $x = -1$, which are often simple candidates for extrema in such problems?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student missed testing obvious candidate points that could have revealed the extrema without calculus.  \n\n(Continuing...)  \n\nDid you consider that the function might attain its extrema where $(x+1)^2$ and $\\sin x$ align favorably with the denominator?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student did not analyze the phase relationship between the quadratic and oscillatory terms in the numerator.  \n\n(Proceeding until \"zzc.\")  \n\nWhat was your rationale for not using the fact that $\\frac{\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ decays to $0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$, leaving $\\frac{(x+1)^2}{x^2+1}$ to dominate?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student failed to recognize the asymptotic dominance of the quadratic term, which simplifies the search for global extrema.  \n\n(End of probing after 20 rounds.)  \n\n**Final Diagnosis:** The student's primary error was over-reliance on differentiation without exploring alternative methods such as bounding, asymptotic analysis, or strategic evaluation at key points. This led to unnecessary computational complexity and an incomplete solution.\nStudent：I don't know the exact value of $M + m$ because after differentiating $f(x)$ directly, the calculations became too difficult, and I wasn't able to finish finding the extrema.\nTeacher：**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student's error was persisting with differentiation as the sole method despite encountering computational complexity, without considering simpler analytical or numerical approaches to bound or estimate the extrema.  \n\n(Since \"zzc\" was not received, I continue probing.)  \n\nWhat specific part of the derivative calculation became too difficult for you to handle? Was it the algebraic manipulation or solving $f'(x) = 0$?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student struggled with the derivative's algebraic form but did not attempt to simplify or reframe the problem (e.g., by taking logarithmic derivatives or factoring).  \n\n(Continuing...)  \n\nDid you consider that the extrema might occur where $\\sin x$ is at its maximum ($1$) or minimum ($-1$), which could simplify the analysis?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student overlooked leveraging the boundedness of $\\sin x$ to constrain the search for extrema to specific cases.  \n\n(Proceeding further.)  \n\nWhen the derivative became unwieldy, did you think to check the function's behavior at $x = 0$ or $x = -1$, where calculations are simpler?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student missed testing critical points where the function's behavior could be evaluated without calculus.  \n\n(Continuing as per protocol.)  \n\nDid you observe that for large $|x|$, the term $\\frac{\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ becomes negligible, reducing the problem to analyzing $\\frac{(x+1)^2}{x^2+1}$?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student failed to exploit asymptotic dominance of the quadratic term, which simplifies the problem in limiting cases.  \n\n**Final Diagnosis:** The student's core error was an over-reliance on differentiation without adapting their strategy when faced with complexity, neglecting simpler bounding, substitution, or asymptotic techniques.\nStudent：I stopped because the differentiation got very messy and I couldn't simplify it enough to solve for the critical points, so I didn't find the exact values for $M$ and $m$.\nTeacher：**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student's error was abandoning the problem due to computational complexity in differentiation without exploring alternative methods such as bounding, estimation, or evaluating the function at strategic points.  \n\n(Since \"zzc\" was not received, I continue probing.)  \n\nWhen you say the differentiation got \"very messy,\" can you describe which part of the derivative was most problematic—the quotient rule application, trigonometric terms, or solving $f'(x) = 0$?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student encountered difficulty in managing the derivative's algebraic complexity but did not attempt to break it into smaller, more manageable parts or use approximations.  \n\n(Continuing...)  \n\nDid you consider that the extrema might occur where the numerator $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x$ is maximized or minimized relative to the denominator, rather than strictly solving $f'(x) = 0$?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student did not leverage heuristic reasoning about the numerator's behavior to identify plausible extrema candidates.  \n\n(Proceeding further.)  \n\nWhat made you conclude that exact critical points were necessary, rather than approximating $M$ and $m$ using bounds or graphical intuition?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student assumed exact solutions were required, overlooking acceptable strategies like numerical estimation or qualitative analysis.  \n\n(Continuing as per protocol.)  \n\nDid you check the function's value at $x = 0$ ($f(0) = 1$) or $x = -1$ ($f(-1) = \\frac{\\sin(-1)}{2}$) to see if these were potential extrema?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student neglected to test simple candidate points that could have provided immediate bounds for $M$ and $m$.  \n\n**Final Diagnosis:** The student's primary error was fixating on exact differentiation without pivoting to simpler, viable methods (e.g., substitution, bounds, asymptotics) when the calculus approach became intractable.\nStudent：I think the differentiation step just became too messy to solve for the critical points, so I wasn't able to get a specific value for $M + m$.\nTeacher：**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student's error was persisting with an overly complex differentiation approach without recognizing the opportunity to simplify the problem by analyzing the function's behavior at key points or using bounds for $\\sin x$.\n\n(Since \"zzc\" was not received, I continue probing.)\n\nDid you consider evaluating the function at x=π/2 or x=-π/2 where sin x reaches its maximum and minimum values, which might correspond to extrema of f(x)?\n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student failed to test critical values of the trigonometric component that could have revealed potential extrema without solving f'(x)=0.\n\n(Continuing...)\n\nWhen you say the differentiation was too messy, did you attempt to write out the full derivative expression? What specific part seemed unsolvable to you?\n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student encountered difficulties with the derivative's form but didn't attempt to separate the problem into more manageable components or use approximation techniques.\n\n(Proceeding further.)\n\nDid you observe that for large x values, the sin x term becomes insignificant compared to the polynomial terms, allowing you to analyze a simplified version of the function?\n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student overlooked asymptotic analysis which could have provided clear bounds for the function's behavior at extremes.\n\n**Final Diagnosis:** The student's core error was an inability to move beyond the complicated differentiation approach, missing multiple opportunities to solve the problem through strategic evaluation, bounding, or asymptotic analysis.\nStudent：I just thought that finding the extrema required differentiation, so I applied the quotient rule to $f(x)$, but the resulting expression was too messy to solve for $x$, especially with the $\\sin x$ in the numerator, so I gave up on that approach and didn't try anything else.\nTeacher：**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student's error was assuming differentiation was the only valid method for finding extrema, leading to premature abandonment of the problem when the calculus approach became complicated, without considering alternative analytical strategies.\n\n(Since \"zzc\" was not received, I continue probing.)\n\nWhen you applied the quotient rule, did you consider that the derivative's complexity might suggest the extrema occur at points where either the numerator or denominator has special behavior, rather than attempting to solve f'(x)=0 algebraically?\n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student did not recognize that critical points might correspond to simple cases (e.g., where sin x = ±1) that could be identified without fully solving the derivative equation.\n\n(Continuing...)\n\nWhat made you conclude that no other methods (like testing integer multiples of π/2 for sin x) were worth attempting after the differentiation approach failed?\n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student's rigid adherence to calculus blinded them to heuristic approaches that exploit the periodic nature of sin x and the polynomial's behavior.\n\n(Proceeding further.)\n\nDid you observe that the denominator x²+1 is always positive, meaning you could multiply through by it when analyzing f'(x)=0 to potentially simplify the equation?\n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student missed an opportunity to simplify the critical point equation by eliminating the denominator, which might have made the problem more tractable.\n\n**Final Diagnosis:** The student's fundamental error was methodological inflexibility - treating differentiation as obligatory while neglecting bounding, substitution, and asymptotic techniques that could have solved the problem more elegantly.\nStudent：No, I didn't try to multiply through by the denominator or look for those special behaviors; I just stopped when the derivative seemed too complex to solve.\nTeacher：**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student's error was prematurely abandoning the problem upon encountering complexity in the differentiation approach, without attempting to simplify the problem through algebraic manipulation or strategic evaluation of special cases.  \n\n(Since \"zzc\" was not received, I continue probing.)  \n\nWhen you saw the derivative was complex, did you consider whether the extrema might occur at points where $\\sin x = 0$ or $\\cos x = 0$, which could simplify the equation significantly?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student failed to exploit the periodic nature of trigonometric functions to identify potential critical points without solving the full derivative equation.  \n\n(Continuing...)  \n\nWhat was your reasoning for not testing values like $x = 0$, $x = \\pi/2$, or $x = -\\pi/2$, where the trigonometric terms take simple values that might reveal extrema?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student neglected to evaluate the function at strategically chosen points that could have provided immediate bounds or exact extrema.  \n\n(Proceeding further.)  \n\nDid you consider that the problem might not require exact solutions for $M$ and $m$, but rather bounds or estimates that could be obtained without full differentiation?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student assumed exact calculus was necessary, overlooking approximation techniques that could have yielded the required sum $M + m$.  \n\n**Final Diagnosis:** The student's core error was a lack of methodological flexibility—abandoning the problem when differentiation proved difficult without exploring simplification strategies, special cases, or estimation methods.\nStudent：No, I just gave up when the derivative looked too complicated, and I didn't really think about checking those special points like $x = 0$ or $x = \\pi/2$.\nTeacher：**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student's error was prematurely terminating their problem-solving effort due to perceived complexity in the differentiation approach, without exploring simpler analytical methods such as evaluating the function at strategic points or leveraging known properties of trigonometric functions.\n\n(Since \"zzc\" was not received, I continue probing.)\n\nWhen you saw the derivative was complicated, did you consider that the maximum or minimum might occur at points where the numerator or denominator has obvious behavior, such as where $(x+1)^2$ is minimized or $\\sin x$ is maximized?\n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student failed to recognize that extrema could be identified by analyzing the components of the function separately, rather than solely through solving $f'(x) = 0$.\n\n(Continuing...)\n\nWhat was your thought process when you decided not to test any specific values of $x$? Did you assume that differentiation was the only valid method for finding extrema?\n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student operated under the incorrect assumption that calculus was the exclusive tool for extremal analysis, neglecting basic function evaluation.\n\n(Proceeding further.)\n\nDid you consider graphing the function or using numerical methods to estimate where the maxima and minima might occur, even if just for intuition?\n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student did not employ graphical or numerical techniques to gain insight into the function's behavior before abandoning the problem.\n\n**Final Diagnosis:** The student's primary error was methodological inflexibility—abandoning the problem at the first sign of computational difficulty without exploring alternative approaches such as point evaluation, component analysis, or estimation techniques.\nStudent：No, I didn't test any specific $x$ values because I thought I had to use differentiation to find the extrema, and when that got too complicated, I just stopped trying.\nTeacher：**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student's error was an incorrect assumption that differentiation was the only valid method for finding extrema, leading to premature abandonment of the problem without exploring simpler evaluation or bounding techniques.\n\n(Since \"zzc\" was not received, I continue probing.)\n\nWhat made you believe that testing specific values of \\( x \\) (like \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( x = \\pi/2 \\)) wouldn't help identify potential extrema, even as a starting point?\n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student overlooked the utility of heuristic evaluation at key points, which could have provided immediate bounds or exact extrema without calculus.\n\n(Continuing...)\n\nDid you consider that the problem might be designed to reward insight (e.g., symmetry or periodicity) over brute-force computation, given the complexity of the derivative?\n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student failed to recognize the problem's potential for strategic simplification by leveraging the structure of \\( \\sin x \\) and the quadratic term.\n\n(Proceeding further.)\n\nWhen you stopped, did you think to check the function's behavior as \\( x \\to \\infty \\) or \\( x \\to -\\infty \\), where the \\( \\sin x \\) term becomes negligible?\n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student neglected asymptotic analysis, which would have revealed that \\( f(x) \\approx 1 \\) for large \\( |x| \\), simplifying the search for extrema.\n\n**Final Diagnosis:** The student's core error was a false dichotomy in problem-solving—viewing differentiation as the only legitimate approach and abandoning the problem when it proved difficult, rather than adapting their strategy to include evaluation, bounds, or asymptotic reasoning.\nStudent：No, I didn't think testing those $x$ values would help; I just thought differentiation was necessary to find the extrema, so once that got too hard, I gave up and didn't consider other options.\nTeacher：**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student's error was a rigid adherence to differentiation as the sole method for finding extrema, leading to premature abandonment of the problem without exploring simpler evaluation or bounding techniques.  \n\n(Since \"zzc\" was not received, I continue probing.)  \n\nWhat made you believe that testing specific values (e.g., \\( x = 0 \\), \\( x = \\pi/2 \\)) was irrelevant, even though such points often reveal extrema in problems with trigonometric components?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student failed to recognize that strategic evaluation at key points could bypass the need for complex calculus, especially when the function combines polynomial and periodic terms.  \n\n(Continuing...)  \n\nDid you consider that the problem might be structured so that \\( M + m \\) could be deduced from symmetry or other properties, even without exact values for \\( M \\) and \\( m \\)?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student overlooked potential symmetries or patterns in the function that could simplify the problem, such as pairing maxima and minima.  \n\n(Proceeding further.)  \n\nWhen you gave up, did you think to estimate \\( M \\) and \\( m \\) by bounding \\( \\sin x \\) (e.g., \\( -1 \\leq \\sin x \\leq 1 \\)) and analyzing the resulting inequalities?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student did not leverage basic inequalities to constrain the function's range, which would have provided a path forward without differentiation.  \n\n**Final Diagnosis:** The student's fundamental error was methodological inflexibility—treating differentiation as obligatory while neglecting evaluation, bounding, and symmetry-based approaches that could have solved the problem efficiently.\nStudent：No, I thought the only way to find the extrema was through differentiation, and I didn't consider trying to simplify the function or use other strategies. When the derivative became overwhelming, I just assumed I couldn't solve the problem.\nTeacher：**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student's error was a narrow focus on differentiation as the exclusive method for finding extrema, leading to premature surrender when the calculus approach became complex, without attempting simplification, evaluation at key points, or bounding techniques.  \n\n(Since \"zzc\" was not received, I continue probing.)  \n\nWhat was your reasoning for not considering that the maximum and minimum might occur at points where either the quadratic term $(x+1)^2$ or the trigonometric term $\\sin x$ dominates the behavior of the function?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student failed to analyze the function's components separately to identify potential extrema, missing an opportunity to simplify the problem.  \n\n(Continuing...)  \n\nDid you think to check the function's value at $x = 0$, where $\\sin x = 0$, or at $x = \\pi/2$, where $\\sin x = 1$, to see if these points might correspond to extrema?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student neglected to test obvious candidate points where the function's behavior could be evaluated without solving $f'(x) = 0$.  \n\n(Proceeding further.)  \n\nWhen you concluded that the problem was unsolvable, did you consider that the sum $M + m$ might be deducible from symmetry or asymptotic behavior, even without exact values for $M$ and $m$?  \n\n**Diagnosis and Statement:** The student did not explore the possibility that the problem's structure (e.g., symmetry or decay of $\\sin x$) might allow $M + m$ to be determined indirectly.  \n\n**Final Diagnosis:** The student's core error was a lack of methodological adaptability—fixating on differentiation as the only valid approach and abandoning the problem when it proved challenging, rather than employing alternative strategies like evaluation, bounding, or asymptotic analysis.\nStudent：zzc",
