    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I think $k > 0$.\nTeacher：Let me probe further to understand your reasoning. Why do you think k must be greater than 0 for the function f(x) = kx - lnx to be monotonically increasing on (1, +∞)?\nStudent：Because I thought that for the function to be increasing, its derivative $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}$ should be greater than or equal to $0$, so $k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0$, which led me to believe $k > 0$.\nTeacher：Your error is that you did not consider the minimum value of the expression \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) on the interval \\( (1, +\\infty) \\), which is necessary to determine the correct range for \\( k \\).\nStudent：Oh, so does that mean I need to use the smallest possible value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ on $(1, +\\infty)$, which is as $x$ goes to infinity and $\\frac{1}{x} \\to 0$? So, even if $k$ is barely above $0$, as $x$ gets smaller and approaches $1$ from above, $\\frac{1}{x}$ gets closer to $1$? So, do I actually have to make sure $k$ is greater than or equal to $1$ for all $x > 1$?\nTeacher：Teacher：Your error is that you did not explicitly state the condition that \\( k \\geq \\frac{1}{x} \\) must hold for all \\( x > 1 \\), which requires \\( k \\geq 1 \\) because the maximum of \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) on \\( (1, +\\infty) \\) is 1.\nStudent：zzc",
