    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $i(1+i)^2$\nTeacher：Let's analyze option A step by step. First, can you tell me what you got when you expanded (1 + i)²?  \n\n**Student's error:** The student incorrectly assumed that expanding (1 + i)² would result in a purely imaginary number without verifying the calculation.  \n\n**Reason for the mistake:** The student did not properly expand the expression (1 + i)² to determine whether the final result was purely imaginary.  \n\n(Waiting for \"zzc\" or further response to continue probing if necessary.)\nStudent：When I expanded $(1+i)^2$, I thought it would give me $i^2$, which is $-1$, so I assumed the result would be purely imaginary.\nTeacher：**Teacher:** I see your reasoning. Let's examine this carefully - when you expanded (1 + i)², did you apply the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b² correctly?\n\n**Student's error:** The student incorrectly calculated (1 + i)² as simply i² (-1), neglecting the other terms in the expansion.\n\n**Reason for the mistake:** The student failed to fully expand the binomial expression, omitting the 1 and 2i terms that would appear in the proper expansion.\n\n(Waiting for \"zzc\" or further response to continue probing if necessary.)\nStudent：No, I didn’t apply that formula step by step. When I saw $1 + i$, I just thought squaring it would give me $i^2$, which is $-1$, so I thought the result must be a purely imaginary number.\nTeacher：**Teacher:** I understand your thought process now. Let me point out the key oversight in your approach.\n\n**Student's error:** The student incorrectly assumed that squaring (1 + i) would only affect the imaginary part (i), completely ignoring the real component (1) in the expression.\n\n**Reason for the mistake:** The student failed to recognize that binomial expressions require full expansion, and that both the real and imaginary parts contribute to the final result when squared.\n\n(Waiting for \"zzc\" or further response to continue probing if necessary.)\nStudent：zzc",
