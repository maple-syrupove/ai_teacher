    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I choose D: $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Let me analyze your choice. You selected D, claiming that $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function. Let's recall that for an odd function h(x), we must have h(-x) = -h(x). \n\nGiven f(x) is odd (f(-x) = -f(x)) and g(x) is even (g(-x) = g(x)), let's test D:\n\n$|f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$\n\nBut for oddness, we'd need this to equal $-|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$, which isn't true unless f(x)g(x)=0.\n\nYour error was incorrectly identifying the composition of absolute value with the product of odd and even functions as odd. \n\nThe correct statement is: You incorrectly concluded that the absolute value of the product of an odd and even function would be odd, when in fact it's even.\nStudent：Oh, I see. But doesn't the absolute value make the function flip over the x-axis, like odd functions do?\nTeacher：Your error was misunderstanding how the absolute value operation affects the symmetry properties of functions. The absolute value preserves sign symmetry (making outputs non-negative) rather than creating sign alternation characteristic of odd functions.\nStudent：But how do we systematically check whether a function is odd or even in cases like this?\nTeacher：Teacher：Your error was focusing on general checking methods rather than recognizing the specific misconception about how absolute value interacts with function composition in this problem.\nStudent：So you mean I should have substituted $-x$ into the expression for each option?\nTeacher：Your error was not recognizing that while substitution is indeed the standard method, your fundamental mistake was in misapplying this method specifically to the absolute value operation in combination with odd and even functions.\nStudent：So the usual way is to plug in $-x$ and compare, but I just looked at D and thought it “looked” odd because of the absolute value. I didn’t try substituting $-x$ for each option.\nTeacher：Your error was relying on visual intuition about the absolute value's effect rather than methodically verifying the function's symmetry properties through substitution.\nStudent：Oh, I see. I guess I thought the absolute value with the product of odd and even would still make it odd, so I picked D without going through and checking each one fully.\nTeacher：Your error was assuming the absolute value operation would preserve or create odd symmetry in the function composition, when in fact it transforms the product into an even function.\nStudent：zzc",
