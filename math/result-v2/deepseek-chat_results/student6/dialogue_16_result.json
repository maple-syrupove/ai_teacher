    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I don't think $\\phi$ can be solved from the given information.\nTeacher：Let me help you understand the problem better. The question states that when the graph of y = cos(2x + φ) is shifted right by π/2 units, it becomes identical to y = sin(2x + π/3). What transformation occurs when we shift a cosine function right by π/2 units?\nStudent：When we shift the graph of $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units, we replace $x$ with $x + \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so it becomes $y = \\cos\\left(2(x + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi\\right) = \\cos\\left(2x + \\pi + \\phi\\right)$.\nTeacher：Your error is in the transformation step - you incorrectly applied the horizontal shift by adding π/2 instead of subtracting it when replacing x.\nStudent：Oh, I see. So after the shift, it should be $y = \\cos\\left(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi\\right) = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$. But even after making this correction, I still don't see how to make this into a sine function or set it equal to $y = \\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$.\nTeacher：Your error is in not recognizing the phase shift relationship between cosine and sine functions - you need to use the identity that connects shifted cosine functions to sine functions.\nStudent：zzc",
