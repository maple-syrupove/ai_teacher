You did not consider the domain of the function before determining its monotonicity.\nStudent：Why do I need to consider the domain first if I can just differentiate $f(x)$ and solve for where $f'(x) > 0$? I thought that would be enough to find where the function is increasing.\nTeacher：You incorrectly determined the interval of monotonicity without first ensuring the function is defined on that interval.\nStudent：Oh, I see… But when I differentiated $f(x)$, I got $f'(x) = \\frac{2x-2}{x^2-2x-8} > 0$. Solving that gives $x > 1$. Isn't that the interval where it's increasing? Why isn't this correct?\nTeacher：You failed to consider that the function is only defined on intervals where $x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0$, which excludes the interval $(1, +\\infty)$ from being valid.\nStudent：zzc",
