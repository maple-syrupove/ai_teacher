    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $i(1+i)^2$\nTeacher：Let me check your reasoning. Why did you choose option A?\nStudent：Because I saw $i$ and $(1+i)$ in the expression, and since $i$ is imaginary, I assumed the whole expression would also be purely imaginary. So I picked A.\nTeacher：Your assumption that the presence of $i$ in an expression guarantees a purely imaginary result is incorrect.\nStudent：Oh, I see. So just having an $i$ in the expression doesn't necessarily mean the entire value will be purely imaginary? How can that be?\nTeacher：Yes, the presence of $i$ in an expression does not guarantee that the result will be purely imaginary; it depends on how the expression is evaluated. \n\nStudent：zzc\nStudent：zzc",
