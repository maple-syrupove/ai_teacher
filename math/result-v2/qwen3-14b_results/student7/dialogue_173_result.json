    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：B. $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$\nTeacher：Your answer is incorrect. You incorrectly determined the relationship between sets $A$ and $B$.\nStudent：I thought that $A \\cap B$ means the part where $A$ and $B$ are 'similar', so I first took $A$ as $x<2$, and then got stuck when $B$ was written as $3-2x>0$. I didn't see a value of $x$ that fits both just by looking at them, so I picked $\\varnothing$ in the end.\nTeacher：Your error was incorrectly solving the inequality for set $B$, leading to an incorrect conclusion about the intersection of $A$ and $B$.\nStudent：But doesn't $A \\cap B$ mean where both conditions are true? I saw $A$ is $x<2$, and for $B$, I left it as $3-2x>0$, so I just tried to think if they had anything in common, and since I wasn't sure what $B$ was exactly, I thought they didn't intersect. Was I supposed to solve $3-2x>0$?\nTeacher：Yes, you were supposed to solve the inequality for set $B$. Your error was not solving the inequality $3 - 2x > 0$ correctly, which led you to incorrectly assume that $A$ and $B$ had no overlap.\nStudent：But if I just look at $3-2x>0$ as is, is it not clear enough? I thought the overlap is only where $x<2$ and also $3-2x>0$, but since I didn't know what range $B$ actually represents, I just went with none there. Should I have rewritten $3-2x>0$ in terms of $x$ first?\nTeacher：Yes, you should have rewritten the inequality $3 - 2x > 0$ in terms of $x$ to determine the actual range for set $B$. Your error was not solving the inequality $3 - 2x > 0$ correctly, which led you to incorrectly assume that $A$ and $B$ had no overlap.\nStudent：But even if I see $A$ as $x<2$, and $B$ as $3-2x>0$, don't I just need to find where both are true? Since $A$ is all $x$ less than $2$, and $B$ is $3-2x>0$, which I didn't solve, I just thought of the intersection as wherever those two conditions are both satisfied. Is that not enough?\nTeacher：Your error was not solving the inequality $3 - 2x > 0$ correctly, which led you to incorrectly assume that $A$ and $B$ had no overlap.\nStudent：But, if I just use both conditions as they are without solving for $x$ for $B$, then their overlap is not clear. I thought intersection just means where both are satisfied, so I looked at $x<2$ and $3-2x>0$ at the same time, but since it's not obvious what $B$ actually is, I thought maybe there's no intersection. Isn't it okay to just leave the conditions like that for intersection?\nTeacher：Your error was not solving the inequality $3 - 2x > 0$ correctly, which led you to incorrectly assume that $A$ and $B$ had no overlap.\nStudent：zzc",
