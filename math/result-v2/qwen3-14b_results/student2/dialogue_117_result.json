    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C.\nTeacher：Your answer is incorrect. You have misapplied the trigonometric identity for $\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$.\nStudent：Didn’t I just use $\\cos^2 A = 1 - \\sin^2 A$? I thought I could write $\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1 - \\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ and then maybe substitute the given value? Is that not correct?\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the identity $\\cos^2 A = 1 - \\sin^2 A$, as this is not a valid trigonometric identity.\nStudent：But isn’t $\\cos^2 A + \\sin^2 A = 1$, so $\\cos^2 A = 1 - \\sin^2 A$? Where did I go wrong?\nTeacher：The identity $\\cos^2 A = 1 - \\sin^2 A$ is correct, but it does not help in this problem because you do not have information about $\\sin\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$. Instead, you need to use a different identity that relates $\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ to $\\sin 2\\alpha$.\nStudent：Oh, so I shouldn’t just substitute $\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$ for $\\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$? I thought since they both had $\\sin$, maybe I could do that. What identity should I be using instead?\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that $\\sin 2\\alpha$ is equivalent to $\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$, which are not related by a direct substitution.\nStudent：zzc",
