    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to differentiate $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ and find its critical points, but the derivative became very complicated and I wasn't able to find explicit values for $M$ and $m$. So I couldn't compute $M+m$.\nTeacher：It seems you attempted to find critical points by differentiating the function, but you may have overlooked a simpler approach that avoids explicitly solving for critical points.\nStudent：Yes, I thought differentiation was the only way to find the extrema, but when I tried taking the derivative of $\\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$, the expressions got really messy. I tried to solve $f'(x)=0$, but I got confused with the product and quotient rules and ended up not being able to solve for $x$. So, I gave up at that stage.\nTeacher：It appears you made the error of assuming that differentiation is the only method to find extrema, without considering alternative simplifications or properties of the function that could lead to a more straightforward solution.\nStudent：That's true. I didn't look for any simplification or other way; I just started differentiating and got stuck in the calculations.\nTeacher：You made the error of not recognizing that the function can be split into simpler components whose maximum and minimum values can be analyzed separately, rather than directly differentiating the entire expression.\nStudent：I didn't realize that the function could be split or rewritten in a way that made it easier to analyze. I just kept working with the original form.\nTeacher：You made the error of not recognizing that the function can be split into simpler components whose maximum and minimum values can be analyzed separately, rather than directly differentiating the entire expression.\nStudent：I didn't try to split the function; I just tried to differentiate it as it was, and when it got too complicated, I couldn't proceed. I mostly focused on applying the quotient rule to the whole fraction.\nTeacher：You made the error of not recognizing that the function can be split into simpler components whose maximum and minimum values can be analyzed separately, rather than directly differentiating the entire expression.\nStudent：I didn't try to split the function; I just tried to differentiate it as it was, and when it got too complicated, I couldn't proceed.
