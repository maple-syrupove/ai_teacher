    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find $M$ and $m$ by directly differentiating $f(x)$ and solving $f'(x)=0$, but the calculations became too complicated, so I wasn't able to get a value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：It sounds like the calculations for the derivative and solving for critical points were quite complex. Have you considered any alternative methods to find $M+m$ without explicitly finding $M$ and $m$? What do you notice about the function when you look at its structure?\nStudent：I looked at the formula, but I wasn’t sure how to simplify it, so I just tried going ahead with finding the derivative as it was.\nTeacher：When you examined the function, did you notice that it can be simplified by splitting into more manageable parts, such as separating the polynomial and trigonometric components? This might help in finding $M+m$ without explicitly solving for $M$ and $m$. What do you think about this approach?\n\nStudent: I see, I didn't think about splitting the function. I'll try to separate it into parts and see if that helps. \n\nTeacher: Splitting the function into parts is a good idea. Let's take another look at the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2 + 1} \\). Notice that you can write it as:\n\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2}{x^2 + 1} + \\frac{\\sin x}{x^2 + 1} \\]\n\nThe first part, \\( \\frac{(x+1)^2}{x^2 + 1} \\), simplifies to \\( 1 + \\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} \\). The second part, \\( \\frac{\\sin x}{x^2 + 1} \\), is bounded because \\( \\sin x \\) oscillates between -1 and 1. Did you consider these observations while trying to find \\( M \\) and \\( m \\)?\n\nStudent: I see now, I should have split the function. I only focused on the derivative and didn't think about breaking it down. Thank you for pointing that out.\n\nTeacher: You're welcome. The error was in not considering the structure of the function and how it could be broken down into simpler parts, which would make it easier to analyze.\nStudent：zzc",
