    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: $\\{-3,-2,-1,0,1\\}$.\nTeacher：Your answer includes numbers that are not in the set \\( M \\). Could you explain why you included -3 and 1 in your answer?\nStudent：I thought since the interval for \\( M \\) is from -3 to 1, and both -3 and 1 are mentioned in set \\( N \\), they should be part of the intersection.\nTeacher：The interval for \\( M \\) is \\(-3 < x < 1\\), which means that \\( x \\) can be any real number greater than -3 and less than 1, but not including -3 and 1 themselves. Therefore, -3 and 1 are not part of the set \\( M \\).\nStudent：Oh, I see. So only the numbers between -3 and 1, not including -3 and 1, are in \\( M \\). So I should only consider the elements of \\( N \\) that are greater than -3 and less than 1. That would be \\(-2\\), \\(-1\\), and \\(0\\).\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that the numbers -3 and 1 are not included in set \\( M \\). Therefore, the intersection \\( M \\cap N \\) should only include the elements of \\( N \\) that are strictly between -3 and 1.\n\nThe error you made was including -3 and 1 in the intersection, even though they are not part of the set \\( M \\).\nStudent：zzc",
