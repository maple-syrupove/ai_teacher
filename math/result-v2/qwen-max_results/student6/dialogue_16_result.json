    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I don’t think $\\phi$ can be solved.\nTeacher：Let's break down the problem to see where you might be having trouble. When we shift the graph of \\( y = \\cos(2x + \\phi) \\) to the right by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) units, the new function becomes \\( y = \\cos\\left(2\\left(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\phi\\right) \\). Simplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[ y = \\cos\\left(2x - \\pi + \\phi\\right) \\]\n\nWe are given that this shifted graph coincides with the graph of \\( y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) \\). Using the identity \\(\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), we can rewrite the sine function as a cosine function:\n\n\\[ y = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\cos\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) \\]\n\nNow, we equate the two cosine functions:\n\n\\[ \\cos\\left(2x - \\pi + \\phi\\right) = \\cos\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) \\]\n\nSince the cosine functions are equal, their arguments must differ by an integer multiple of \\(2\\pi\\):\n\n\\[ 2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi \\quad \\text{for some integer } k \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n\\[ -\\pi + \\phi = -\\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi \\]\n\n\\[ \\phi = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi \\]\n\n\\[ \\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi \\]\n\nGiven the constraint \\(-\\pi \\leq \\phi < \\pi\\), we need to find the appropriate value of \\(k\\). For \\(k = 0\\):\n\n\\[ \\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} \\]\n\nThis value is within the given range. So, \\(\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\).\n\nCan you tell me what part of this process you found confusing?\nStudent：I just saw that one was a cosine function and the other was a sine function and thought there wasn't enough information to solve for φ directly, since they were different types of trigonometric functions.\nTeacher：The error you made is in assuming that the different types of trigonometric functions (sine and cosine) prevent you from solving for \\(\\phi\\) directly. In fact, you can use the identity \\(\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\) to rewrite the sine function as a cosine function, which allows you to equate the arguments and solve for \\(\\phi\\).\nStudent：zzc",
