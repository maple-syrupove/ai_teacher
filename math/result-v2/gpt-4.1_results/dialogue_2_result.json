Should I have done something else with the given $\\sin 2\\alpha$?\n教师：Your error stems from attempting to directly use $\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ and the provided value of $\\sin 2\\alpha$ without representing $\\cos^{2}\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ in terms of $\\sin 2\\alpha$ through the appropriate identities.\n学生：Okay, so since $\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$, can't I just say that $\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ equals $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2$ and then use $1-\\sin^2$ for $\\cos^2$ here?\n教师：Your error is conflating $\\sin 2\\alpha$ with $\\sin\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$, which are not equivalent; therefore, squaring $\\sin 2\\alpha$ does not yield $\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$.\n学生：zzc",
