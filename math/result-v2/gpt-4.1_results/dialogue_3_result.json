So, are you saying that because the absolute value is always non-negative, it can't be an odd function unless it's the zero function?\n教师：Yes, your error was in thinking that a function involving absolute value could be odd, when in reality, the absolute value output is always non-negative, preventing it from satisfying the defining property of an odd function unless the function is identically zero.\n学生：zzc",
