    "history_prompt": "\n学生：A. $\\frac{3}{10}$\n教师：The error in your choice is that you have likely overcounted the number of possible Pythagorean triples within the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, as not all combinations of three different numbers from this set can form the sides of a right-angled triangle.\n学生：Oh, did I include too many? I thought that any combination that fits the triangle inequality would work, so I just checked all the possible combinations, and for a few of them, I thought they work. Isn't that right? How should I check if the combination forms a Pythagorean triple?\n教师：The error in your reasoning is that satisfying the triangle inequality is not sufficient; a Pythagorean triple specifically requires that the square of the largest number equals the sum of the squares of the other two numbers.\n学生：I checked for a^2 + b^2 = c^2 with the numbers, but I thought there might be more than one solution. Isn't there more than just (3,4,5)?\n教师：The error in your approach is that you assumed there could be more than one Pythagorean triple using only the numbers from 1 to 5, when in fact (3, 4, 5) is the only valid Pythagorean triple in this set.\n学生：zzc",
