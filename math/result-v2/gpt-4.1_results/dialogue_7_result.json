I looked at $A$ as all $x$ less than $2$, and when I tried to apply that to $B$, I didn’t see any overlap, so I picked the empty set.\n教师：The reason for your mistake is that you have made an error in analyzing the conditions that define set $B$ and did not correctly determine the range of values for $x$ that satisfy $B$.\n学生：Oh, I see—I just looked at $B$ as it was written, $3-2x>0$, and didn’t rewrite it, so I just tried to think about it together with $A$ without really solving the inequality from $B$. Is that where I messed up?\n教师：Yes, the reason for your mistake is that you did not rewrite or solve the inequality $3-2x>0$ to find the precise set of $x$ that satisfy $B$, which led to your incorrect conclusion about the intersection.\n学生：zzc",
