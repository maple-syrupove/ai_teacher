    "history_prompt": "\n学生：My answer is A. $\\{-2,-1,0,1\\}$\n教师：Your error is that you included the element $1$ in your answer, but $1$ is not an element of $M$ because $M$ only contains real numbers strictly less than $1$.\n学生：Oh, so $M$ doesn't include $1$? But I thought the interval was from $-3$ to $1$, so I just took all the integers between them, including $-3$ and $1$. Why doesn't $1$ get included?\n教师：Your error is that you interpreted the interval notation $-3 < x < 1$ as including the endpoints $-3$ and $1$, but in fact, the strict inequalities mean that the set $M$ excludes both $-3$ and $1$.\n学生：Ah, so the interval doesn't include the endpoints. I see. So then $-3$ and $1$ wouldn't be counted. That means I should have just looked at the numbers between $-3$ and $1$. So, since $N$ is $\\{-3,-2,-1,0,1\\}$, and $-2,-1,0$ are in between, is the answer C, $\\{-2,-1,0\\}$?\n教师：Yes, your revised thought process is correct; you identified which elements in $N$ fall within the open interval $-3 < x < 1$. Your initial error was not recognizing the open interval excludes the endpoints $-3$ and $1$, leading you to incorrectly include them in your intersection.\n学生：zzc",
