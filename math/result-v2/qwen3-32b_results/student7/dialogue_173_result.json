    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose B, $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$.\nTeacher：Teacher: That is incorrect. The error you made was assuming that the sets A and B do not overlap, when in fact they do share common elements.\nStudent：But since $A$ is all $x$ where $x<2$, and I thought $B$ was something else, I just didn't see an overlap and chose $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$.\nTeacher：Your mistake was incorrectly interpreting the set $ B = \\{x \\mid 3 - 2x > 0\\} $, which led you to believe it does not overlap with $ A $.\nStudent：Oh, so should I have looked at $B$ differently? I thought $B$ was just another set, but do I need to rewrite the inequality somehow first before comparing?\nTeacher：You are on the right track. The error you made was failing to simplify the inequality defining set $ B $, which is essential to understanding its relationship with set $ A $.\nStudent：Ah, so I should first solve $3 - 2x > 0$ for $x$ before trying to find the intersection with $A$? I didn't do that—I just looked at $B$ as it was written, and didn't try to make both sets comparable. Is that where things went wrong?\nTeacher：You are correct in realizing that solving the inequality for $ B $ is necessary. The error you made was failing to simplify and interpret $ 3 - 2x > 0 $ correctly, which would have shown that $ B = \\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2} \\} $.\nStudent：zzc",
