    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema of $f(x)$ by differentiating the original function directly, but the derivative became very messy and complicated, so I couldn't get a specific value for $M + m$.\nTeacher：Teacher: That is understandable, as directly differentiating $f(x)$ can lead to a complicated expression. What did you try next?\nStudent：After the derivative got too messy, I tried plugging in some simple values for $x$ to estimate the maximum and minimum, but I couldn’t find a clear answer for $M + m$ this way either.\nTeacher：Teacher: It seems you are approaching the problem by focusing only on numerical estimation and direct differentiation. What method did you consider for simplifying or re-expressing the function $f(x)$ to make it more tractable?\nStudent：I didn't think about transforming the function into a different form. I mainly just tried to work with the original fraction and its derivative without changing its structure.\nTeacher：Teacher: The error in your approach is that you did not consider simplifying or re-expressing the function to recognize a key algebraic identity or symmetry, which could have greatly simplified finding $ M + m $.\nStudent：zzc",
