    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I think the answer is $k>0$.\nTeacher：Based on the problem, the function \\(f(x) = kx - \\ln x\\) must be monotonically increasing on \\((1, +\\infty)\\), which requires its derivative \\(f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}\\) to satisfy \\(f'(x) \\geq 0\\) for all \\(x > 1\\). This condition simplifies to \\(k \\geq \\frac{1}{x}\\) for all \\(x > 1\\). The function \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) decreases as \\(x\\) increases, and as \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right, \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) approaches 1. Therefore, \\(k\\) must be at least 1 to ensure \\(k \\geq \\frac{1}{x}\\) holds for all \\(x > 1\\).  \n\nYou stated that the answer is \\(k > 0\\). However, values of \\(k\\) in \\((0, 1)\\) fail the condition. For example, if \\(k = 0.5\\), then at \\(x = 1.1\\), \\(f'(x) = 0.5 - \\frac{1}{1.1} \\approx -0.409 < 0\\), violating the monotonicity requirement.  \n\nThe student's error is that they did not account for the supremum of \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(1^+\\), which necessitates \\(k \\geq 1\\).  \n\nzzc\nStudent：zzc",
