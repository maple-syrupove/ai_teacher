    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by directly differentiating $f(x)$ and setting the derivative to zero, but the expression became very complicated, and I got stuck in the calculation. I couldn't find the specific values for $M$ and $m$, so I left the answer blank.\nTeacher：Did you consider evaluating \\( f(-x) \\) and comparing it to \\( f(x) \\) to see if there is a relationship that could simplify the problem?\nStudent：No, I didn't try evaluating $f(-x)$ or compare it to $f(x)$. I just started by finding the derivative of $f(x)$ directly.\nTeacher：The error is that you did not consider the symmetry of the function by evaluating \\(f(-x)\\) and observing that \\(f(x) + f(-x) = 2\\). Why do you think you overlooked this step in your initial approach?\nStudent：I think I overlooked this step because I was focused on finding the extrema through differentiation, and I didn't think to check for any symmetry properties or alternative strategies to simplify the problem before starting the calculations.\nTeacher：Student, you mentioned that your focus on differentiation led you to overlook symmetry. However, the core error remains that you failed to recognize the functional symmetry \\(f(x) + f(-x) = 2\\), which simplifies finding \\(M + m\\) without complex calculus. Why did you not revisit the problem’s structure after the derivative became complicated?\nStudent：I think when the derivative got complicated, I just felt stuck and didn't really know how to proceed, so I didn't try to look for alternative ways or transformations that could have made the calculation easier. I was kind of overwhelmed by the complexity and didn't step back to reconsider my approach.\nTeacher：The reason for your mistake is that the overwhelming complexity of the derivative calculation prevented you from stepping back to recognize the symmetry property \\(f(x) + f(-x) = 2\\), which would have simplified the problem. Now, can you elaborate on why this feeling of being stuck made it difficult for you to recall or consider symmetry as an alternative approach?\nStudent：When I got stuck with the derivative being so complex, I mainly focused on trying to push through with the calculations, hoping I could maybe simplify or get somewhere eventually. Because I was absorbed in those steps, it didn't really occur to me to try completely transforming the function or to investigate its deeper properties like symmetry. I think I was so fixated on following the calculus method that I just didn't think about other, possibly easier strategies.\nTeacher：The reason for your mistake is that the complexity of the derivative and your fixation on the calculus approach prevented you from recognizing the symmetry property \\(f(x) + f(-x) = 2\\), which is essential for simplifying the problem. Reflecting on this error, what do you believe is the most important lesson to prevent such oversights in future problems?\nStudent：I think the most important lesson is not to get fixated on just one method, like calculus, especially if it gets complicated, and to take a step back and look for other possible ways to simplify the problem, such as trying to transform the function or checking for properties like symmetry. That way, I might find a much simpler solution instead of getting stuck.\nTeacher：The reason for your mistake is that your fixation on differentiation without first exploring symmetry properties led to unnecessary complexity and obscured the critical relation \\(f(x) + f(-x) = 2\\). Reflecting on your initial approach, what specific aspect of the function's form (e.g., the presence of \\(\\sin x\\) or the denominator) made symmetry seem non-obvious or irrelevant to you at first glance?\nStudent：I think the presence of $\\sin x$ in the numerator made me focus on dealing with the trigonometric function itself, and with the denominator being $x^2+1$, I didn't immediately think there might be any useful symmetry. The different terms seemed unrelated with respect to symmetry, so I didn't consider checking how $f(-x)$ would relate to $f(x)$.\nTeacher：The reason for your mistake is that the presence of the trigonometric term \\(\\sin x\\) and the polynomial structure of the numerator and denominator distracted you from performing a direct computation of \\(f(-x)\\), which would have revealed the symmetry property \\(f(x) + f(-x) = 2\\). Given that the trigonometric term is odd and the polynomial terms have specific symmetries, why did you not view evaluating \\(f(-x)\\) as a necessary initial step despite the apparent complexity?\nStudent：I think I just didn't have the habit of checking for symmetries as an initial step, especially when I saw trigonometric terms mixed with polynomials. I usually associate symmetry checks with simpler or more obviously symmetric expressions, so with $\\sin x$ and $x^2+1$ together, I didn't immediately think that evaluating $f(-x)$ would produce anything helpful. I was more focused on following standard calculus procedures.\nTeacher：The reason for your mistake is that the even denominator and the mixed parity of the numerator did not prompt you to compute \\(f(-x)\\) explicitly, which would have revealed the symmetry \\(f(x) + f(-x) = 2\\). Reflecting on this oversight, what specific aspect of the numerator's decomposition into even and odd parts (e.g., \\((x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1\\) containing both even and odd terms alongside the odd \\(\\sin x\\)) made the symmetry non-intuitive to you, leading you to skip this critical step?\nStudent：I think because $(x+1)^2$ expands to $x^2 + 2x + 1$, which mixes even and odd powers, together with the odd function $\\sin x$, it wasn’t immediately clear to me how the terms would interact if I plugged in $-x$. I didn’t notice that the odd parts might cancel or combine in a symmetric way, so I didn’t try rewriting or transforming the expression. The numerator just seemed complicated rather than hinting at any symmetry, so I didn’t consider that approach and just started differentiation.\nTeacher：The reason for your mistake is that the mixed even and odd terms in the numerator, combined with the trigonometric component, created an apparent complexity that deterred you from performing the basic substitution \\( f(-x) \\), which would have directly revealed the symmetry \\( f(x) + f(-x) = 2 \\). Given that the substitution \\( x \\to -x \\) is a fundamental algebraic step requiring no advanced manipulation, why did you perceive the mixed terms as a barrier to even attempting this computation, rather than treating it as a routine verification?\nStudent：I think I saw the mixture of even and odd terms as making the substitution messy or unhelpful, so I just assumed it wouldn’t simplify the function in a useful way. Because of that, I didn’t make the attempt to compute $f(-x)$, and I didn’t think to look for any underlying structure that might be revealed by substitution.\nTeacher：The reason for your mistake is that you prematurely assumed the substitution \\(x \\to -x\\) would be unproductive due to the mixed even and odd terms, without actually performing the computation that would have revealed the simplifying symmetry \\(f(x) + f(-x) = 2\\).  \n\nSince we have reached the maximum dialogue rounds (20), this conversation must conclude.\nStudent：zzc",
