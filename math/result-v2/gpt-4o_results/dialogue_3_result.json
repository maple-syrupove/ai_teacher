    "history_prompt": "\n学生：I choose D.\n教师：The student's error is in assuming that the absolute value of the product of an odd function and an even function, $|f(x) \\bullet g(x)|$, affects the parity of the function, when in fact the absolute value results in a non-negative function, which cannot be classified as odd.\n学生：Oh, I thought that since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, their product might inherit properties from both—so I guessed that taking the absolute value would still keep it odd, since the signs could just flip. Was that reasoning wrong?\n教师：Yes, that reasoning was incorrect. The student's mistake was assuming that flipping signs via the absolute value would preserve oddness. The absolute value eliminates any negative signs, resulting in a function that is always non-negative and cannot be classified as odd.\n学生：I see, but isn’t it possible for the absolute value operation to still allow some functions to be odd? For example, if the original function is always non-negative in the first place? Or maybe I misunderstood how exactly to check for odd or even functions. Should I always just look at the signs, or is there a specific method to test parity for more complicated expressions?\n教师：Yes, the absolute value operation can indeed result in an odd function under certain conditions, primarily when the original function is symmetric in a particular way about the y-axis. However, generally speaking, an odd function satisfies the condition \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in the domain. On the other hand, an even function satisfies the condition \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\). Absolute values, by definition, make the entire function non-negative, which affects this symmetry needed to define a function as odd. Therefore, one should not look solely at flipping signs but should test against the core definitions for odd and even functions to determine their parity.\n学生：Oh, so for parity, I should use those definitions directly and substitute $-x$ into the function to compare with the original, rather than just guessing based on the form or the signs?\n教师：Yes, that is correct. The student should use the definitions directly by substituting \\(-x\\) into the function and comparing it with the original to determine parity, rather than guessing based on the form or the signs.\n学生：zzc",
