I thought if I used the sine double angle formula, maybe it would fit, but I guess I don't see exactly how. Can you tell me which identity I should use to handle $\\cos^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ with the information given?\n教师：The student's error is in not recognizing the need to apply the appropriate trigonometric identities to express $\\cos^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ using the given information about $\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$. They need to consider identities that relate angles and transformations, such as those involving the addition for cosine, and how they relate $\\alpha$ and $2\\alpha$.\n学生：zzc",
