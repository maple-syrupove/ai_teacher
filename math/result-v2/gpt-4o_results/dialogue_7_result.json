Termination Condition: If you determine that the teacher has precisely and correctly stated the reason for your error in a declarative sentence, your response must be the exact string \"zzc\". Remember, only respond with \"zzc\" if the teacher points out the error in a declarative tone. If they ask a question (interrogative sentence), answer their question.

You will engage in a dialogue with a student who is asking you questions, and from this conversation, you must identify the error the student has made on a given problem.

    "history_prompt": "\n学生：B. $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$\n教师：The student's error is in the interpretation of the overlap between set $A$ and set $B$. Both sets include values for $x<2$ and $x<\\frac{3}{2}$ respectively, with set $B$ actually comprising of values that satisfy the inequality $x < \\frac{3}{2}$. Consequently, $A \\cap B$ is not an empty set, but a set of values that satisfy both conditions simultaneously, i.e., $x < \\frac{3}{2}$.\n学生：Oh, I thought the intersection would be empty because the answer I got ($\\{x | x < 2\\}$) wasn't among the options. Is the intersection really $\\{x|x < \\frac{3}{2}\\}$? How should I have approached that?\n教师：The error in your reasoning was neglecting to recognize that set $B$, given as $\\{x \\mid 3 - 2x > 0\\}$, translates to the condition $x < \\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$ encompasses all values of $x$ that are less than $\\frac{3}{2$, not an empty set.\n学生：zzc",
