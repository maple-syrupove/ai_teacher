    "history_prompt": "\n学生：I chose A. $\\{-2, -1, 0, 1\\}$.\n教师：The error lies in the student's inclusion of the number 1 in the intersection of sets \\( M \\) and \\( N \\). The set \\( M \\) is defined to exclude 1, hence the correct intersection cannot include 1.\n学生：Oh, so should I have only included numbers that are strictly less than 1? I thought since 1 is part of N and at the edge of the interval, it should be included. Could you clarify how the boundaries work in this context?\n教师：The student's mistake was in assuming that the boundary number 1 should be included in the intersection because it's part of set \\( N \\). However, according to the definition of set \\( M \\), the numbers are strictly less than 1, meaning 1 should not be included in \\( M \\), thus it cannot be part of the intersection \\( M \\cap N \\).\n学生：Thank you, I see now. Just to confirm, for numbers like -3, since the interval is -3 < x < 1, we don't include -3 or 1. So should the intersection be $\\{-2, -1, 0\\}$ then?\n教师：The error lies in the student's correct conclusion that the intersection should exclude -3 and 1, thereby resulting in the intersection of sets \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) being \\(\\{-2, -1, 0\\}\\).\n学生：zzc",
