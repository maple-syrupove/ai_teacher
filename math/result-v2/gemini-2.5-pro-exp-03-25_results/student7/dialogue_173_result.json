    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose B, $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$.\nTeacher：Can you tell me how you solved the inequality for set B?\nStudent：I saw $B = \\{x \\mid 3-2x > 0\\}$, but I mainly focused on $A$ since it was $x < 2$. I didn't do much with the inequality in B, I just tried to find the overlap with $A$.\nTeacher：If you didn't solve the inequality for B, how did you determine that there were no numbers in common between set A and set B?\nStudent：I thought about the intersection as just \"the similar parts\" of A and B, and since I already had $x<2$ for A, I wrote $A \\cap B = \\{x|x<2\\}$. But since that wasn't one of the answer choices, I picked B, the empty set.\nTeacher：You did not solve the inequality that defines set B before attempting to find its intersection with set A.\nStudent：Yes, I skipped solving the inequality for B, I just focused on A’s condition and looked for what seemed to be the overlapping part.\nTeacher：You did not determine the elements of set B before trying to find the intersection between set A and set B.\nStudent：That's right, I didn't find the elements of set B first, I only looked at A's condition and tried to see where they matched.\nTeacher：You incorrectly determined the intersection by considering the condition for set A alone, instead of the conditions for both set A and set B.\nStudent：Yes, I only considered A’s condition when I was trying to find the intersection, not both A and B’s conditions.\nTeacher：You attempted to find the intersection of two sets without considering the defining characteristic of one of the sets.\nStudent：Yes, I didn't really use the defining characteristic of set B, I just used A’s and didn’t think more about what B actually was.\nTeacher：You attempted to find the intersection of sets A and B without first establishing the identity of set B.\nStudent：Yes, that’s basically what happened—I didn’t establish what set B really was before trying to find the intersection.\nTeacher：You disregarded the condition $3-2x>0$ that specifies which numbers belong to set B.\nStudent：Yes, that’s true. I ignored the $3-2x>0$ condition for set B and just worked based on A.\nTeacher：You proceeded to find the intersection of the two sets without having first determined the range of values for x that satisfy the condition for set B.\nStudent：Yes, that's what I did—I tried to find the intersection without first figuring out what x values actually satisfy set B.\nTeacher：You did not simplify the definition of set B to a more direct comparison for x before comparing it with set A.\nStudent：zzc",
