    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $i(1+i)^2$\nTeacher：Can you explain how you arrived at this answer?\nStudent：I saw that the expression had $i$ and $(1+i)$, and since $i$ is imaginary, I thought multiplying them would give a purely imaginary number. Also, the form looked similar to previous purely imaginary answers I've seen, so I picked it.\nTeacher：Thank you for sharing your thought process. Can you please show me the step-by-step calculation you performed to simplify the expression $i(1+i)^2$?\nStudent：I actually didn't perform the full calculation. I just saw that $i$ and $(1+i)$ were involved, and I thought that multiplying them, especially since $i$ is the imaginary unit, would result in a purely imaginary answer. So I just chose option A based on that.\nTeacher：You made a conclusion based on the appearance of the expression rather than simplifying it through calculation.\nStudent：zzc",
