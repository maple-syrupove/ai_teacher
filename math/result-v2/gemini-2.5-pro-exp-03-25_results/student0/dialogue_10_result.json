    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the maximum and minimum by differentiating $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ directly, but I got stuck with complicated derivatives, so I couldn't get a value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：I see. Differentiating directly can indeed be very challenging for this problem. Did you try to manipulate or simplify the expression for $f(x)$ before you attempted to differentiate it?\nStudent：No, I just tried to work through the derivative as it was, and it quickly became pretty messy with all the terms, especially involving the sine part. I didn't really think about changing it into another form first.\nTeacher：That's a very common experience when a direct calculation becomes too complex. It's often a sign that there might be a more elegant property of the function to exploit. Let's examine the function's structure. Can you see any way to rewrite the expression for $f(x)$ to make it simpler to analyze?\nStudent：I'm not sure. I thought about maybe factoring something or splitting the numerator, but I couldn't see a straightforward way to make it simpler, so I just stuck with trying to directly differentiate. Do you have a hint on what kind of rewrite might help?\nTeacher：That's a great instinct to have. Often, when a problem looks complicated, simplifying the expression is a key first step. Let's follow that thought. You mentioned trying to split the numerator. What do you get if you first expand the $(x+1)^2$ term in the numerator?\nStudent：Expanding $(x+1)^2$ gives $x^2 + 2x + 1$, so the numerator becomes $x^2 + 2x + 1 + \\sin x$.\nTeacher：Excellent. Now that you have the expanded numerator, how does that help you split the fraction $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x + 1 + \\sin x}{x^2+1}$ into simpler parts?\nStudent：So, $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x + 1 + \\sin x}{x^2+1} = \\frac{x^2+1}{x^2+1} + \\frac{2x}{x^2+1} + \\frac{\\sin x}{x^2+1}$. So, $f(x) = 1 + \\frac{2x}{x^2+1} + \\frac{\\sin x}{x^2+1}$.\nTeacher：That's an excellent way to break down the function. You now have $f(x) = 1 + \\frac{2x}{x^2+1} + \\frac{\\sin x}{x^2+1}$. How does this decomposition help you determine the maximum value $M$ and the minimum value $m$?\nStudent：I'm not really sure how it helps. Since the terms are still complicated, I guess I would still need to find the derivative of the whole thing to get the extrema. Maybe it's still going to be messy to find the exact values.\nTeacher：I understand your hesitation. It seems like we've just rearranged the complexity. However, the problem asks for the sum $M+m$, not for the individual values of $M$ and $m$. This is a very common clue in problems like this. It suggests we should investigate the properties of the function rather than trying to compute the exact extrema.\n\nLet's focus on the part you separated, which we can call $g(x) = \\frac{2x+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$. Does this function have any special symmetric properties? For example, what is the relationship between $g(x)$ and $g(-x)$?\nStudent：Let me check: $g(-x) = \\frac{2(-x) + \\sin(-x)}{(-x)^2+1} = \\frac{-2x - \\sin x}{x^2+1} = -g(x)$. So $g(x)$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：That's exactly right, $g(x)$ is an odd function. Now, how does knowing that $g(x)$ is an odd function help you find the sum $M+m$ for the original function $f(x)=1+g(x)$?\nStudent：I'm not sure. Knowing that $g(x)$ is odd, maybe that means the maximum and minimum values are negatives of each other, but I don't see how that leads directly to the sum $M+m$. I think I would still need to know what either the maximum or minimum is to add them together.\nTeacher：You have not correctly established the relationship between the maximum and minimum values of the function $f(x)$ and the maximum and minimum values of the odd function $g(x)$.\nStudent：Oh, I thought I could only figure out $M$ and $m$ by calculating the derivative and finding the precise maximum and minimum values directly. Since I couldn't finish that, I didn't try to connect $M$ and $m$ through the symmetry of $g(x)$. I still thought $M$ and $m$ had to be separately calculated.\nTeacher：Your error was assuming that the individual values of M and m must be calculated separately, which caused you to dismiss the significance of the odd function property you had correctly identified.\nStudent：zzc",
