    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I don't think $\\phi$ can be solved.\nTeacher：Can you show me the equation of the graph after you shifted it to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units?\nStudent：After shifting, the equation is $y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi) = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：That's a correct first step. The equation of the shifted graph is indeed $y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$. What did you do next to try and solve for $\\phi$?\nStudent：After that, I didn't know how to proceed because the other function is a sine function and couldn't figure out how to make the equations comparable, so I thought maybe $\\phi$ can't be solved.\nTeacher：I understand why you'd think that. It's challenging when the functions aren't the same. Have you learned any trigonometric identities that allow you to convert a sine function into a cosine function, or vice versa?\nStudent：I know there are some conversion formulas, but I wasn't sure how to use them in this situation, so I didn't think to try converting one function to the other.\nTeacher：That's perfectly understandable. Let's try using one of those conversion formulas now. We can use the identity $\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. How would you apply this identity to rewrite $y = \\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$?\nStudent：If I apply the identity, then $y = \\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\cos\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)$.\nTeacher：That's a perfect conversion. Now you have two expressions for the exact same function: $y = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$ and $y = \\cos(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6})$. What does this tell you about the relationship between the two arguments, $(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$ and $(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6})$?\nStudent：That means the arguments must be equal for all x, so $2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}$, so $\\phi = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$.\nTeacher：That's a very direct path to an answer. Let me ask you this: if you have two expressions, let's call them A and B, and you know that $\\cos(A) = \\cos(B)$, is it always true that A must be equal to B?\nStudent：No, because cosine is a periodic function, so it's possible for $A$ and $B$ to differ by a multiple of $2\\pi$, or by a negative sign, and the cosine values would still be the same. So $A = B + 2k\\pi$ or $A = -B + 2k\\pi$ for integer $k$.\nTeacher：That is a very thorough statement of the general solution. So when you apply those two conditions to the arguments in our problem, what do you get for each case?\nStudent：For the first case, $2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$, so $\\phi = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$.\n\nFor the second case, $2x - \\pi + \\phi = -\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) + 2k\\pi$, so $2x - \\pi + \\phi = -2x + \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$, which simplifies to $4x + \\phi = \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$, so $\\phi = \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi - 4x$. But this depends on $x$, which is not possible for a fixed $\\phi$. So the only possible solution is from the first case.\n\nTherefore, $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$. Since $-\\pi \\leq \\phi < \\pi$, $k = 0$ works, so $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$.\nTeacher：You're on the right track with setting up two cases, but you made a mistake in your analysis of the second case. You correctly simplified the equation to an expression that still contains $x$, but can you tell me why this means that case is not a valid solution?\nStudent：Because if $\\phi$ depended on $x$, it wouldn't be a constant, but in the equation for the function $y = \\cos(2x+\\phi)$, $\\phi$ has to be a fixed constant in the range $[-\\pi, \\pi)$. So if solving gives a solution where $\\phi$ varies with $x$, that can't be valid for this problem.\nTeacher：You are mistaken in your reasoning for why that case is invalid; you should have concluded that the equation itself cannot be true for all values of x, because an expression that varies with x cannot be equal to a constant.\nStudent：zzc",
