    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：D. $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Can you explain why you think option D, $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function? What property of odd or even functions influenced your choice?\nStudent：I saw that odd times even might give an odd function, and taking absolute value seemed fine, so I chose D.\nTeacher：Could you clarify what you mean by \"taking absolute value seemed fine\"? How does the absolute value impact the odd or even nature of the function?\nStudent：I thought that since the product $f(x)\\cdot g(x)$ could be odd, taking the absolute value would still preserve oddness.\nTeacher：Can you explain how taking the absolute value of a product might affect whether the resulting function remains odd? What specific property are you considering?\nStudent：I thought the sign wouldn't matter after taking the absolute value, so if the product was odd, the absolute value would be as well.\nTeacher：Are you assuming that the absolute value of an odd function is still odd? How does the absolute value operation affect the function's behavior for negative inputs?\nStudent：If I take $|h(-x)|$, the result is always non-negative, so it might not keep the original function's oddness.\nTeacher：Let's think about this. If a function is odd, what must be true about $h(-x)$ compared to $h(x)$? Does the absolute value operation maintain that relationship?\nStudent：If a function is odd, then $h(-x) = -h(x)$. But after applying absolute value, $|h(-x)| = |h(x)|$, which doesn't maintain that relationship.\nTeacher：You've identified a key point. The mistake in your reasoning is assuming that the absolute value of a product of functions preserves oddness. It doesn't, as $|h(-x)| = |h(x)|$ shows the result is even, not odd.\nStudent：zzc",
