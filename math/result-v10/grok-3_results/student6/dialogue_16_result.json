    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I answered: Since after shifting $y=\\cos(2x+\\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the graph coincides with $y=\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})$, so the equation is $2x+\\phi=2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3}$, thus $\\phi=\\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\nTeacher：Can you explain how a right shift by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) units affects the argument of the cosine function?\nStudent：A right shift by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units means replacing $x$ with $x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ in the function. So, the new argument becomes $2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi = 2x - \\pi + \\phi$.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. How does this new argument, \\(2x - \\pi + \\phi\\), relate to the argument of the sine function, \\(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), after the shift?\nStudent：I thought they should be equal, so I set $2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, leading to $\\phi = \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\nTeacher：Are you considering any phase relationship between sine and cosine functions when setting the arguments equal?\nStudent：No, I only set the arguments equal after the shift and did not consider the phase relationship between sine and cosine.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining. Are you aware that sine and cosine functions are related by a specific phase shift? How might this impact your approach?\nStudent：I know they are related, but I didn't use that relationship in my approach. I just tried to set the arguments equal directly.\nTeacher：Thank you for your honesty. Could you clarify why you believe setting the arguments directly equal would account for the shift between sine and cosine?\nStudent：I thought that since the graphs coincided after the shift, their arguments should match, so I set them equal directly.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining your thought process. Are you considering that sine and cosine functions inherently differ by a phase shift, which might affect how their arguments align after the transformation?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider the phase shift difference between sine and cosine when aligning their arguments.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. It seems your mistake lies in not accounting for the inherent phase difference between sine and cosine functions when setting their arguments equal after the shift.\nStudent：zzc",
