    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：C. $\\frac{1}{2}$\nTeacher：I'm glad you're working on this problem. Can you tell me how you arrived at the value of cosine squared in your answer? What key steps did you take?\nStudent：I used the identity $\\cos^2 A = 1 - \\sin^2 A$, so I wrote $\\cos^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = 1 - \\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$. Then I substituted the given value.\nTeacher：I see. Can you clarify how you handled the expression inside the sine function when substituting? What did you do with the angle $\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$?\nStudent：I directly used $\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$ as the value for $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$.\nTeacher：I understand. Can you explain why you thought $\\sin 2\\alpha$ could be directly used as $\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ in your calculation?\nStudent：Because I thought they were equivalent or at least could be substituted directly since both involve sine and $\\alpha$.\nTeacher：Thank you for explaining your thought process. Can you consider if there’s a difference between the angles $2\\alpha$ and $\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ in the sine function? How do they relate?\nStudent：They are different; $2\\alpha$ is double the angle, while $\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ is a sum of $\\alpha$ and $45^\\circ$. Their sine values are not generally equal.\nTeacher：Thank you for recognizing the difference. Can you reflect on how this distinction between $2\\alpha$ and $\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ might have impacted your substitution in the sine function?\nStudent：It means my substitution wasn't valid because the arguments of the sine function are not the same, so the values would be different.\nTeacher：Thank you for your insight. I’m certain now that your mistake was equating $\\sin 2\\alpha$ directly to $\\sin(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$. This is incorrect due to the difference in angles.\nStudent：zzc",
