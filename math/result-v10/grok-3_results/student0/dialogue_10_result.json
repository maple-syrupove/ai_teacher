    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by differentiating $f(x)$ directly, but my calculation got too complicated and I couldn’t finish. So, I did not find a specific value for $M+m$.\nTeacher：Can you tell me what made the differentiation of $f(x)$ feel complicated? Was there a specific part of the function that posed a challenge?\nStudent：The numerator had $(x+1)^2+\\sin x$ and the denominator was $x^2+1$, so applying the quotient rule created a long and messy expression.\nTeacher：I see. Did you consider simplifying the function or breaking it into smaller parts before differentiating to make the quotient rule less cumbersome?\nStudent：No, I started differentiating right away without trying to simplify or transform the function first.\nTeacher：Understood. Could you specify which terms in the numerator or denominator seemed most difficult to handle when applying the quotient rule?\nStudent：The presence of both $(x+1)^2$ and $\\sin x$ in the numerator made the differentiation tedious, especially when expanding and combining their derivatives with the denominator.\nTeacher：I understand. Did you notice any possible way to rewrite or separate the terms in the numerator to simplify the differentiation process?\nStudent：No, I didn't look for a way to rewrite or separate the terms before starting the differentiation.\nTeacher：Understood. Did the idea of splitting the function into two fractions, based on the numerator's terms, occur to you as a potential simplification strategy?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider splitting the numerator into two separate fractions.\nTeacher：I see. Did you realize that splitting the function into parts like (x+1)^2/(x^2+1) and sin(x)/(x^2+1) could simplify the differentiation process?\nStudent：No, I didn't realize I could split it like that to make things simpler.\nTeacher：Thank you for clarifying. It seems your mistake was not considering splitting the function into simpler fractions before differentiating, which would have made the process less complex. I'll wait for your response.\nStudent：zzc",
