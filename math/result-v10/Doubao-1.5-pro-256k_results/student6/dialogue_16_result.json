    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I don't know how to solve for $\\phi$ because the two sides are different trigonometric functions.\nTeacher：When a function $y = \\cos(2x+\\phi)$ is shifted to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units, what is the formula for the new function? And how do we convert $\\sin$ to $\\cos$ (or vice - versa) using trigonometric identities?\nStudent：After shifting to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the new function is $y = \\cos\\left(2(x-\\frac{\\pi}{2})+\\phi\\right) = \\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.  \nFor converting $\\sin$ to $\\cos$, $\\sin\\theta = \\cos(\\theta-\\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nTeacher：Good. Now, since $\\cos(2x - \\pi+\\phi)$ coincides with $\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})$, and $\\sin(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3})=\\cos(2x+\\frac{\\pi}{3}-\\frac{\\pi}{2})=\\cos(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6})$. Did you set up the equation for $\\phi$ correctly based on the equality of these two cosine functions?\nStudent：I think I didn't set up that equation, because I was stuck at the different forms and didn't connect them.\nTeacher：The error is that you didn't set up the equation based on the equality of the two cosine functions: $\\cos(2x - \\pi+\\phi)=\\cos(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6})$. From this equation, we can solve for $\\phi$.\nStudent：zzc",
