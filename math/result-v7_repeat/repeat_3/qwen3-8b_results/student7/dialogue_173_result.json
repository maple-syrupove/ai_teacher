Solving gives $x < \\frac{3}{2}$.\nTeacher：What is the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$?\nStudent：The intersection is $A \\cap B = \\{x \\mid x<2\\}$.\nTeacher：The intersection of $A$ and $B$ is the set of all $x$ that satisfy both $x < 2$ and $x < \\frac{3}{2}$. What is the correct condition for this overlap?\nStudent：The correct condition is $x<\\frac{3}{2}$.\nTeacher：A. $A \\cap B = \\left\\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2}\\right\\}$ is correct.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：I see. However, let's revisit the options. Which option correctly reflects $A \\cap B$?\nStudent：Option A, $A \\cap B = \\{x \\mid x < \\frac{3}{2}\\}$.\nTeacher：I see. However, let's revisit the options.

What led you to initially think the intersection was empty?\nStudent：I thought at first that the conditions for $A$ and $B$ did not overlap, so I assumed their intersection was empty.\nTeacher：Your initial assumption that $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$ was based on a misunderstanding of how the conditions $x < 2$ and $x < \\frac{3}{2}$ overlap. The error was assuming there is no overlap between the two sets.\nStudent：zzc",
