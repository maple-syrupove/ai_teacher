    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is A. $\\{-2,-1,0,1\\}$.\nTeacher：Your answer includes 1, which is not in the set $M$. Did you check if 1 belongs to $M$?\nStudent：I thought 1 was included since it was at the end of the interval.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed the interval for $M$ is closed at 1. The set $M$ is defined as $-3 < x < 1$, so 1 is not included. Did you consider the open interval notation?\nStudent：I saw the interval notation, but I still thought the endpoints should be considered.\nTeacher：You misunderstood the open interval notation. The symbol \"<\" indicates that the endpoints are excluded. Therefore, 1 is not part of set $M$. Did you verify the definition of $M$ again?\nStudent：I checked the definition, but I still thought that if the endpoints are shown in the set $N$, they could be included.\nTeacher：You are conflating the definitions of set $M$ and set $N$. Set $M$ is defined by an open interval, excluding endpoints, while set $N$ is a discrete set containing specific integers. Did you consider that only elements in both sets are included in the intersection?\nStudent：I thought any element appearing in both $N$ and as an endpoint of $M$ could be included in the intersection.\nTeacher：You incorrectly assumed that endpoints of $M$ can be included in the intersection simply because they appear in $N$. The intersection requires elements that are in both $M$ and $N$, but $M$ explicitly excludes its endpoints. Did you verify which elements of $N$ lie strictly between $-3$ and $1$?\nStudent：I checked $N$ and saw that $-2$, $-1$, $0$, and $1$ are between $-3$ and $1$, so I included those.\nTeacher：You incorrectly included 1 in the intersection because you assumed it lies within the interval $-3 < x < 1$, but 1 is not in $M$ due to the open interval. The correct intersection should exclude 1.\nStudent：zzc",
