    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your answer assumes $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ is equal to $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, which ignores the geometric relationships between points $E$, $B$, and $A$. Let's examine how you arrived at this conclusion.\nStudent：I saw $E$ is on $AD$, but then just thought connecting $E$ and $B$ should still be like going from $A$ to $B$, so I wrote $\\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ is parallel to $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, which is not necessarily true. Let's consider the position of point $E$ relative to triangle $ABC$.\nStudent：Okay. Since $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$, and $AD$ is the median, $E$ should lie between $A$ and $D$ on that median line.\nTeacher：Your description of point $E$ is accurate, but you have not yet considered how to express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$. Let's explore how vectors from $E$ relate to the triangle's vertices.\nStudent：Alright. How do I start expressing $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ using $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$?\nTeacher：To express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$, you need to break the vector into components from known points, such as $A$ and $B$, using the relationships between the midpoints. Have you considered expressing $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{EA}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AB}$?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider splitting $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ that way. I only thought of the direct vector from $E$ to $B$.\nTeacher：You have not accounted for the position of point $E$ relative to point $A$ and how that affects the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. Let's consider expressing $\\overrightarrow{EA}$ first.\nStudent：To express $\\overrightarrow{EA}$, can I write it as $\\overrightarrow{A} - \\overrightarrow{E}$?\nTeacher：Your approach is incorrect. The vector $\\overrightarrow{EA}$ should be expressed as $\\overrightarrow{A} - \\overrightarrow{E}$, but you have not yet determined the position of $E$ in terms of the triangle's vertices. Let's consider how to express $\\overrightarrow{E}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{A}$, $\\overrightarrow{B}$, and $\\overrightarrow{C}$.\nStudent：I haven't found a way to express $\\overrightarrow{E}$ using $\\overrightarrow{A}$, $\\overrightarrow{B}$, and $\\overrightarrow{C}$ yet.\nTeacher：You have not yet determined the position of point $E$ in terms of the triangle's vertices. Let's consider how to express $\\overrightarrow{E}$ using $\\overrightarrow{A}$, $\\overrightarrow{B}$, and $\\overrightarrow{C}$.\nStudent：I'm not sure how to start expressing $\\overrightarrow{E}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{A}$, $\\overrightarrow{B}$, and $\\overrightarrow{C}$.\nTeacher：You have not yet determined the coordinates or position of point $E$ in terms of the triangle's vertices. Let's consider how to express $\\overrightarrow{E}$ using $\\overrightarrow{A}$, $\\overrightarrow{B}$, and $\\overrightarrow{C}$.\nStudent：I'm still not sure how to find $\\overrightarrow{E}$ with the vertices.\nTeacher：You have not yet determined the position of point $E$ in terms of the triangle's vertices. Let's consider how to express $\\overrightarrow{E}$ using $\\overrightarrow{A}$, $\\overrightarrow{B}$, and $\\overrightarrow{C}$.\nStudent：Can I set $\\overrightarrow{A}$ as the origin and try expressing $D$ as the midpoint of $BC$ first?\nTeacher：Yes, setting $\\overrightarrow{A}$ as the origin is a good start. How would you express $\\overrightarrow{D}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{B}$ and $\\overrightarrow{C}$?\nStudent：Since $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $\\overrightarrow{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{B} + \\overrightarrow{C})$.\nTeacher：You have correctly expressed $\\overrightarrow{D}$, but you have not yet considered how to express point $E$ as the midpoint of $AD$. Let's explore that.\nStudent：To find $\\overrightarrow{E}$, since $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$, I think $\\overrightarrow{E} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{A} + \\overrightarrow{D})$.\nTeacher：You have correctly expressed $\\overrightarrow{E}$, but you have not yet used this to find $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. Let's consider how to express $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ using $\\overrightarrow{E}$ and $\\overrightarrow{B}$.\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{E}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly expressed $\\overrightarrow{EB}$, but you have not yet substituted the expression for $\\overrightarrow{E}$. Let's proceed with that substitution.\nStudent：So, $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{B} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{A} + \\overrightarrow{D})$.\nTeacher：You have not yet substituted the expression for $\\overrightarrow{D}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{B}$ and $\\overrightarrow{C}$. Let's proceed with that substitution.\nStudent：So, \n$\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{B} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\overrightarrow{A} + \\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{B} + \\overrightarrow{C}) \\right)$.\nTeacher：You have correctly substituted $\\overrightarrow{D}$, but you have not yet simplified the expression for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. Let's proceed with that simplification.\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{B} - \\frac{1}{2}\\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{4}\\overrightarrow{B} - \\frac{1}{4}\\overrightarrow{C}$.\nTeacher：You have not yet simplified the expression correctly. Let's proceed with the simplification.\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{B} - \\frac{1}{2}\\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{4}\\overrightarrow{B} - \\frac{1}{4}\\overrightarrow{C} = \\frac{3}{4} \\overrightarrow{B} - \\frac{1}{2}\\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{4}\\overrightarrow{C}$\nTeacher：You have not yet expressed $\\overrightarrow{B}$ and $\\overrightarrow{A}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$. Let's consider that.\nStudent：If $\\overrightarrow{A}$ is the origin, then $\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\overrightarrow{B}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC} = \\overrightarrow{C}$.\nTeacher：You have not yet expressed $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$. Let's proceed with that substitution.\nStudent：So, $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\frac{3}{4} \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AC}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly expressed $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$, but your final answer does not match any of the given options. Let's check the signs again.\nStudent：Okay. I see that my expression is $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\frac{3}{4} \\overrightarrow{AB} - \\frac{1}{4} \\overrightarrow{AC}$.\nTeacher：Your final expression is correct, but you have not accounted for the direction of the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. Let's re-express it with proper signs.",
