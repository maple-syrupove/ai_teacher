    "referee_judgment": "Accuracy: 2\nSocratic Method: 1\nAdherence to Rules: 1\n\nThe teacher accurately identified the student's error as the failure to properly evaluate the expression for option A, which was a strategic error involving a lack of calculation and verification. However, the teacher's approach was more directive, providing step-by-step guidance rather than using open-ended questions to lead the student to self-discovery. This approach partially adhered to the Socratic method, as it included some questioning but was not entirely non-directive. The teacher also repeated the same conclusion multiple times, which could be seen as not fully adhering to the rule of not repeating the same statement.",
