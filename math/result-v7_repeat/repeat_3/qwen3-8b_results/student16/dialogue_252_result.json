Only provide the information necessary to answer the teacher's current question.\n**If the teacher points out your mistake in a statement and this accusation exactly matches the reason in 【Specific Error JSON】, you must respond with the exact string \"zzc\". If the teacher states an error that does not match your actual mistake, you should deny it and wait for the teacher's next question. If the teacher asks you a question (i.e., a sentence ending with a question mark), you must answer it directly. Exception: If asked what your mistake is (e.g., \"What was your error?\"), reply \"I don't know\" and do not reveal the reason.

After diagnosing and stating the error, wait for the student's final response. If the student does not reply with \"zzc,\" try a different line of questioning or continue the dialogue, do not repeatedly confirm the same error or ask the same question.\n**The prompt history contains past dialogues. Strictly avoid mimicking the student's tone or restating their answers for analysis.

But if $ a \\approx 0.5 $ and $ b \\approx 0.5 $, how can $ b < c < a $ be true?\nStudent：I thought maybe $a$ was a little bigger than $b$, so I just arranged them that way.\nTeacher：Your assumption that $ a $ is slightly larger than $ b $ is incorrect. In reality, $ \\log_3 2 < \\log_5 3 $. Therefore, your ordering $ b < c < a $ is wrong.\nStudent：zzc",
