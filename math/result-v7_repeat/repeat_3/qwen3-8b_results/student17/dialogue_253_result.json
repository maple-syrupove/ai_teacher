    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $\\sqrt{5}$\nTeacher：Using the Law of Cosines, find AB. Then use the Law of Sines to find sin B and cos B, then calculate tan B. Did you use the correct formula for the Law of Cosines?\nStudent：I used the Law of Cosines as $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A$.\nTeacher：You correctly applied the Law of Cosines, but did you label the sides properly? In triangle ABC, side opposite angle C is AB. Did you calculate AB correctly?\nStudent：I tried to solve for $a$, which I took as $BC = 3$. I didn't solve for $AB$ first.\nTeacher：You did not calculate AB first, which is essential for finding tan B. Did you use the correct sides in the Law of Cosines formula?\nStudent：I used $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A$, trying to solve for $a$, not $AB$.\nTeacher：You incorrectly labeled the sides in the Law of Cosines. In triangle ABC, side AB is opposite angle C, so you should have used $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 - 2 \\cdot AC \\cdot BC \\cdot \\cos C$. Did you use the correct sides for angle C?\nStudent：No, I didn't use the sides corresponding to angle C; I tried to use the formula for angle A instead.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the Law of Cosines by using the formula for angle A instead of angle C. This led to an incorrect calculation of AB, which is essential for finding tan B.\nStudent：zzc",
