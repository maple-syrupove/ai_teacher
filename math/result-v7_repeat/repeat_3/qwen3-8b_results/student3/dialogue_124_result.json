    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose D.\nTeacher：Let's analyze the properties of each option. What happens when you take the absolute value of a product of functions?\nStudent：When I take the absolute value of a product, $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$, it is always non-negative for any $x$ because absolute value outputs only non-negative values.\nTeacher：What is the effect of absolute value on the symmetry of a function?\nStudent：The absolute value can change the symmetry of a function. For example, taking the absolute value of an odd function can make it even.\nTeacher：What happens when you take the absolute value of a product of an odd and an even function? Does this operation preserve or alter the symmetry properties?\nStudent：Taking the absolute value of a product of an odd function and an even function can alter the symmetry, because the result is always non-negative and could become even, even if the original product was odd.\nTeacher：You concluded that $|f(x)\\cdot g(x)|$ is odd, but this is incorrect. What is the symmetry of the absolute value of an odd function?\nStudent：The absolute value of an odd function is an even function.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that the absolute value of an odd function is even. However, $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ is odd, so $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is even, not odd. Your mistake was assuming the absolute value preserves the oddness.\nStudent：zzc",
