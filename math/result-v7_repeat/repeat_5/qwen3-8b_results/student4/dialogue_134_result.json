    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer is: $k > 0$.\nTeacher：The function $ f(x) = kx - \\ln x $ is monotonically increasing on $ (1, +\\infty) $. For this to be true, its derivative must be non-negative on that interval. What is the derivative of $ f(x) $?\nStudent：The derivative is $f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x}$.\nTeacher：To ensure $ f(x) $ is monotonically increasing on $ (1, +\\infty) $, we require $ f'(x) \\geq 0 $ for all $ x > 1 $. Given $ f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x} $, what condition must $ k $ satisfy to ensure $ k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0 $ for all $ x > 1 $?\nStudent：I think $k > 0$ is enough for $k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0$ for all $x > 1$.\nTeacher：To ensure $ k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0 $ for all $ x > 1 $, we must find the minimum value of $ \\frac{1}{x} $ on $ (1, +\\infty) $. What is the minimum value of $ \\frac{1}{x} $ on this interval?\nStudent：The minimum value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ on $(1, +\\infty)$ is $0$.\nTeacher：The minimum value of $ \\frac{1}{x} $ on $ (1, +\\infty) $ is not $ 0 $; it approaches $ 0 $ as $ x \\to +\\infty $, but is always positive. What is the maximum value of $ \\frac{1}{x} $ on this interval?\nStudent：The maximum value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ on $(1, +\\infty)$ is $1$, when $x \\to 1^+$.\nTeacher：To ensure $ k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0 $ for all $ x > 1 $, we must have $ k \\geq \\frac{1}{x} $ for all $ x > 1 $. Since the maximum value of $ \\frac{1}{x} $ on $ (1, +\\infty) $ is $ 1 $, what condition must $ k $ satisfy?\nStudent：$k \\geq 1$\nTeacher：The condition $ k \\geq 1 $ is necessary but not sufficient. What is the behavior of $ f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x} $ as $ x \\to +\\infty $?\nStudent：As $x \\to +\\infty$, $\\frac{1}{x} \\to 0$, so $f'(x) \\to k$.\nTeacher：To ensure $ f'(x) \\geq 0 $ for all $ x > 1 $, we must have $ k \\geq \\frac{1}{x} $ for all $ x > 1 $. Since $ \\frac{1}{x} $ is maximized at $ x = 1 $, what is the minimum value of $ k $ that satisfies this condition?\nStudent：The minimum value of $k$ that satisfies this condition is $k = 1$.\nTeacher：The student's answer $ k > 0 $ is incorrect. The correct condition is $ k \\geq 1 $.\nStudent：Okay, I understand.\nTeacher：The student's initial answer $ k > 0 $ is incorrect because it does not ensure that $ f'(x) = k - \\frac{1}{x} \\geq 0 $ for all $ x > 1 $. The correct condition is $ k \\geq 1 $.\nStudent：zzc",
