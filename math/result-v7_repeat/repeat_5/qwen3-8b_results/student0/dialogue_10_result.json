    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema of $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^{2}+\\sin x}{x^{2}+1}$ by taking its derivative directly, but the calculations got very messy and I couldn't finish.\nTeacher：What did you do with the derivative once you found it?\nStudent：I tried to set the derivative equal to zero and solve for $x$, but the equation was too complicated for me to solve, so I stopped there.\nTeacher：You didn't consider simplifying the function before taking the derivative. Did you try rewriting $f(x)$ in a more manageable form?\nStudent：No, I just started differentiating the original form without trying to rewrite $f(x)$.\nTeacher：You didn't consider simplifying the function before taking the derivative. Did you try rewriting $f(x)$ in a more manageable form?\nStudent：No, I didn't try to rewrite $f(x)$ into a simpler form before differentiating.\nTeacher：You didn't consider simplifying the function before taking the derivative. Did you try rewriting $f(x)$ in a more manageable form?\nStudent：No, I didn't attempt to rewrite or simplify the expression for $f(x)$ before differentiating.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that simplifying the function before differentiation would significantly reduce the complexity of the derivative. Did you attempt to simplify $f(x)$ algebraically before taking its derivative?\nStudent：No, I didn't attempt any algebraic simplification before taking the derivative. I worked directly with the given form.\nTeacher：You overlooked the possibility that simplifying $f(x)$ algebraically could make differentiation much more manageable. Did you consider expanding or rewriting the numerator?\nStudent：No, I didn't consider expanding or rewriting the numerator before differentiating; I used it as given.\nTeacher：You failed to recognize that simplifying the function before differentiation is crucial. Did you consider rewriting the numerator as $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x$ and analyzing its behavior relative to the denominator?\nStudent：No, I did not think to analyze the numerator separately or relate its structure to the denominator before differentiating.\nTeacher：You didn't consider that simplifying the function algebraically or analyzing its structure before differentiation is essential. Did you attempt to split the fraction into simpler terms before taking the derivative?\nStudent：No, I didn't attempt to split the fraction into simpler terms before differentiating.\nTeacher：You missed an essential step: the function can be simplified by splitting the fraction into two terms before differentiation, which would greatly reduce the complexity of the derivative.\nStudent：zzc",
