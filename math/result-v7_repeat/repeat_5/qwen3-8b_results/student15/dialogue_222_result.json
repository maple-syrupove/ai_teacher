I focused only on the magnitudes.\nTeacher：Given $|\\boldsymbol{a}| = 2|\\boldsymbol{b}|$, what relationship can you derive between $\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b}$ and $|\\boldsymbol{b}|^2$?\nStudent：I tried using the magnitudes, but I didn’t consider any dot product relationship between $\\boldsymbol{a}$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}$.\nTeacher：Given $(\\boldsymbol{a} - \\boldsymbol{b}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b} = 0$, what does this equation simplify to in terms of $\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b}$ and $|\\boldsymbol{b}|^2$?\nStudent：It simplifies to $\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b} - |\\boldsymbol{b}|^2 = 0$, or $\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b} = |\\boldsymbol{b}|^2$.\nTeacher：Given $|\\boldsymbol{a}| = 2|\\boldsymbol{b}|$, what is $\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b}$ in terms of $|\\boldsymbol{b}|^2$?\nStudent：$\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b} = |\\boldsymbol{b}|^2$\nTeacher：The dot product $\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b}$ is also equal to $|\\boldsymbol{a}||\\boldsymbol{b}|\\cos\\theta$.
