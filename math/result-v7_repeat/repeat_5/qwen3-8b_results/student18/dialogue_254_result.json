    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C.\nTeacher：Let's consider the symmetry of $ f(x) = \\sin x + \\frac{1}{\\sin x} $. Is $ f(\\pi - x) = f(x) $?\nStudent：Yes, $f(\\pi - x) = \\sin(\\pi - x) + \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi - x)} = \\sin x + \\frac{1}{\\sin x} = f(x)$.\nTeacher：Let's check $ f(\\pi + x) $. Is $ f(\\pi + x) = f(x) $?\nStudent：No, $f(\\pi + x) = \\sin(\\pi + x) + \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi + x)} = -\\sin x - \\frac{1}{\\sin x} \\neq f(x)$.\nTeacher：Let's check $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - x\\right) $. Is $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - x\\right) = f(x) $?\nStudent：Let me check: $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - x\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - x\\right) + \\dfrac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - x\\right)} = \\cos x + \\dfrac{1}{\\cos x}$. This is generally not equal to $f(x)$.\nTeacher：Let's check $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + x\\right) $. Is $ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + x\\right) = f(x) $?\nStudent：Let me check: $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + x\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + x\\right) + \\dfrac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + x\\right)} = \\cos x + \\dfrac{1}{\\cos x}$, which is not equal to $f(x)$.\nTeacher：Let's consider the symmetry about the $ y $-axis. Is $ f(-x) = f(x) $?\nStudent：Let me check: $f(-x) = \\sin(-x) + \\dfrac{1}{\\sin(-x)} = -\\sin x - \\dfrac{1}{\\sin x}$, which is not equal to $f(x)$.\nTeacher：Let's check the minimum value of $ f(x) $. Is $ f(x) \\geq 2 $ for all $ x $ in the domain?\nStudent：Let me check: $f(x) = \\sin x + \\frac{1}{\\sin x}$. If we set $y = \\sin x$, then $-1 < y < 0$ or $0 < y < 1$. For $y > 0$: By AM-GM, $y + \\frac{1}{y} \\geq 2$ for $y > 0$. The minimum is 2 when $y = 1$, i.e., $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTeacher：You assumed the domain of $ y = \\sin x $ is $ y > 0 $, but it also includes $ -1 < y < 0 $. In this range, $ y + \\frac{1}{y} < -2 $, so the minimum value is not 2.\nStudent：Oh, I see. I didn't consider negative values for $y = \\sin x$.\nTeacher：Your error was assuming the domain of $ y = \\sin x $ is restricted to $ y > 0 $, while it also includes $ -1 < y < 0 $. In this range, $ y + \\frac{1}{y} < -2 $, so the minimum value is not 2.\nStudent：That's not exactly my error.\nTeacher：Your error was in assuming the minimum value of $ f(x) $ is 2 without considering the full domain of $ \\sin x $, which includes negative values. This leads to a lower bound of $ -\\infty $, not 2.\nStudent：That's not exactly my error.\nTeacher：Your error was in assuming the minimum value of $ f(x) $ is 2 without considering the full domain of $ \\sin x $, which includes negative values.
