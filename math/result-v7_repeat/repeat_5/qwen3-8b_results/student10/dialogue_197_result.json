    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your answer assumes that vector EB is equal to vector AB, which ignores the geometric relationships between the points. Can you explain how you arrived at this conclusion?\nStudent：I saw that point E is on AD and thought maybe E to B is just A to B, so I wrote $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that points E and A are the same, which is incorrect. Can you explain how you determined the relationship between points E and A?\nStudent：I thought since E is on AD, which starts at A, E might be close to A, so I just used vector AB.\nTeacher：Your reasoning incorrectly assumes that the position of E relative to A is irrelevant to the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. Can you explain how you accounted for the position of E in your calculation?\nStudent：I didn't really consider E's position on AD; I just directly used AB without adjusting for where E actually is.\nTeacher：Your mistake is failing to account for the position of E along AD when expressing $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. Can you explain how you determined the vector from E to B?\nStudent：I didn't break it down; I simply took EB as AB without considering the step from E to B or using section formulas.\nTeacher：Your mistake is not decomposing the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ using the position of E on AD. Can you explain how you determined the components of $\\overrightarrow{EB}$?\nStudent：I didn't determine the components. I just directly wrote $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$, not breaking it down further.\nTeacher：Your mistake is not decomposing the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ using the position of E on AD. Can you explain how you determined the components of $\\overrightarrow{EB}$?\nStudent：I just wrote $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$ without considering or finding components.\nTeacher：Your mistake is not decomposing the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ using the position of E on AD. Can you explain how you determined the components of $\\overrightarrow{EB}$?\nStudent：I didn't determine any components. I only wrote $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$ and didn't break it into parts.\nTeacher：Your mistake is not decomposing the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ using the position of E on AD. Can you explain how you determined the components of $\\overrightarrow{EB}$?\nStudent：I just used $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$ and didn't try to break it into components at all.\nTeacher：Your mistake is not decomposing the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ using the position of E on AD.
