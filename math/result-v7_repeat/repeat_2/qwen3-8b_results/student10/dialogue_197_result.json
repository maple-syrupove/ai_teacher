    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：$\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$\nTeacher：Your answer suggests that point E is the same as point A, which is incorrect. Let's examine how you arrived at this conclusion.\nStudent：I saw that $E$ is on $AD$, so I thought to just use $AB$ directly for $\\overrightarrow{EB}$, since $B$ was an endpoint.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ can be directly expressed as $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, ignoring the position of point $E$ along segment $AD$. Let's explore how you determined the location of $E$ relative to $A$ and $D$.\nStudent：I knew $E$ was the midpoint of $AD$, so it's halfway from $A$ to $D$. But I didn't consider how to use that in the vectors.\nTeacher：Your mistake is assuming that the position of $E$ along $AD$ can be directly translated into a vector from $E$ to $B$ without considering the relationship between vectors $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$. Let's examine how you expressed $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$.\nStudent：I didn't try to express $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$; I just focused on $\\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your error is not expressing $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$, which is essential for determining the correct vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$. Let's explore how you would express $\\overrightarrow{AD}$.\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：You haven't expressed $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$, which is critical for solving the problem.
