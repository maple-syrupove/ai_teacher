    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $\\sqrt{5}$\nTeacher：Using the Law of Cosines, you can find the length of side AB. Then, use the Law of Sines to find angle B and subsequently calculate tan B. Did you compute AB correctly?\nStudent：I actually tried to use the Law of Cosines to find side AC first, but I got stuck.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines is used to find a side when two sides and the included angle are known, not to find an angle when two sides are known. Did you use the correct formula for the Law of Cosines?\nStudent：I used $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A$, but then I got stuck because I didn't know $\\cos A$.\nTeacher：You correctly applied the Law of Cosines, but you misidentified which angle corresponds to the given cosine value. $\\cos C = \\frac{2}{3}$ refers to angle $C$, not angle $A$. Did you use the correct angle in your calculations?\nStudent：No, I used angle $A$, not angle $C$ in my calculations.\nTeacher：You misapplied the Law of Cosines by using angle $A$ instead of angle $C$. The correct formula should use angle $C$ with the given cosine value. Did you use the correct angle in your calculations?\nStudent：No, I didn't use the correct angle; I used angle $A$ instead of angle $C$ in my calculations.\nTeacher：You incorrectly applied the Law of Cosines by using angle $A$ instead of angle $C$.
