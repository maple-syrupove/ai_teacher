    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：φ cannot be solved.\nTeacher：To determine φ, we need to analyze the transformation of the cosine function. What is the general form of a cosine function shifted horizontally?\nStudent：The general form is $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi - h)$, where $h$ is the horizontal shift.\nTeacher：To find φ, we need to relate the shift to the phase difference between the two functions. What is the horizontal shift applied to the original function?\nStudent：The horizontal shift applied is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units to the right.\nTeacher：The shift to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units implies a phase change in the cosine function. What is the relationship between the horizontal shift and the phase shift in the equation $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$?\nStudent：The phase shift is $-2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2} = -\\pi$, so the function becomes $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$.\nTeacher：The student has incorrectly calculated the phase shift. The horizontal shift of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to the right should result in a phase shift of $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\times 2 = -\\pi$, but this needs to be incorporated correctly into the equation. What is the correct transformation of the original function after shifting?\nStudent：After shifting, the transformed function is $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi)$.\nTeacher：The student has not correctly equated the transformed cosine function to the given sine function. What is the relationship between cosine and sine functions?\nStudent：Cosine and sine are related by the identity $\\sin \\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right)$.\nTeacher：The student has not yet equated the transformed cosine function to the given sine function. What is the value of $\\phi$ that satisfies $\\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi) = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$?\nStudent：To satisfy the equation, $(2x + \\phi - \\pi) = \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) - \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, for some integer $k$.\nTeacher：The student has incorrectly applied the identity between sine and cosine. The correct identity is $\\sin \\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. Therefore, the equation should be $\\cos(2x + \\phi - \\pi) = \\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nStudent：Okay, so setting them equal gives $2x + \\phi - \\pi = 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：Simplifying, we get $\\phi - \\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. The student has not considered the periodicity of the cosine function. What is the value of $\\phi$ that satisfies this equation for some integer $k$?\nStudent：Solving, $\\phi - \\pi = -\\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$, so $\\phi = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$.\nTeacher：The student has not considered the restriction $-\\pi \\leq \\phi < \\pi$. What value of $k$ makes $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$ fall within this interval?\nStudent：If $k=0$, then $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$, which is within $-\\pi \\leq \\phi < \\pi$.\nTeacher：The student has not considered that $\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ is within the interval $-\\pi \\leq \\phi < \\pi$. However, $\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ is indeed within the interval. The correct value of $\\phi$ is $\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$.\nStudent：Okay.\nTeacher：The student has correctly identified $\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$, which satisfies the given conditions.\nStudent：I cannot solve for φ.\nTeacher：To solve for φ, we need to analyze the transformation of the cosine function. What is the general form of a cosine function shifted horizontally?\nStudent：The general form is $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi - h)$, where $h$ is the horizontal shift.\nTeacher：The student has incorrectly assumed the form of the shifted cosine function. The correct form after shifting right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is $y = \\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi)$.\nStudent：I see. Then after the shift, the function would be $y = \\cos(2(x-\\frac{\\pi}{2})+\\phi)$.\nTeacher：The student has correctly transformed the function but has not yet equated it to the given sine function. What is the relationship between the transformed cosine function and the given sine function?\nStudent：The transformed cosine function should be set equal to the given sine function: $\\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi) = \\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$.\nTeacher：The student has not yet simplified the left-hand side of the equation. What is the simplified form of $\\cos(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi)$?\nStudent：The simplified form is $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi)$.\nTeacher：The student has correctly simplified the left-hand side of the equation. What is the next step to solve for $\\phi$?\nStudent：The next step is to use the identity between sine and cosine to rewrite the sine function as a cosine function for comparison.\nTeacher：The student has not yet applied the identity $\\sin \\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ to the right-hand side of the equation. What is the equivalent cosine expression for $\\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$?\nStudent：$\\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nTeacher：The student has correctly rewritten the sine function as a cosine function. What is the equation after substituting this identity?\nStudent：After substitution, the equation is: $\\cos(2x - \\pi + \\phi) = \\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.\nTeacher：The student has not yet equated the arguments of the cosine functions directly. What is the relationship between $2x - \\pi + \\phi$ and $2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$?\nStudent：The relationship is $2x - \\pi + \\phi = 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer.\nTeacher：The student has correctly set up the equation but has not simplified the right-hand side of the equation. What is the simplified form of $\\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$?",
