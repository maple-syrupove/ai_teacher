    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose $\\overrightarrow{E B} = \\overrightarrow{A B}$.\nTeacher：Your answer assumes that point E is the same as point B, which is incorrect. Can you explain how you arrived at this conclusion?\nStudent：I thought that since $E$ is on $AD$, and $A$ to $B$ is just the vector $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, then $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ would be the same as $\\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning assumes that vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ is parallel to $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, which is not necessarily true. Can you explain how you determined the direction of $\\overrightarrow{EB}$?\nStudent：I assumed that since E is on $AD$ and B is one of the endpoints, $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ should have the same direction as $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, without calculating the actual vector positions.\nTeacher：Your reasoning incorrectly assumes that the direction of $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ is the same as $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, without considering the position of point $E$ relative to $B$. Can you explain how you determined the relationship between points $E$, $A$, and $B$?\nStudent：I just saw that E is on the segment from A toward D, and B is at one end, so I thought the vector from E to B would be the same as from A to B.\nTeacher：Your reasoning incorrectly assumes that the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ is the same as $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, without considering the relative positions of points $E$, $A$, and $B$. Can you explain how you determined the relationship between vectors $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AB}$?\nStudent：I compared their positions and thought since E is along AD and B is at one end, their vectors align, so $\\overrightarrow{EB} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$.\nTeacher：Your reasoning incorrectly assumes that vectors $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ are parallel or have the same direction, without considering the actual geometric relationships between points $E$, $A$, $B$, and $D$. Can you explain how you determined the direction of $\\overrightarrow{EB}$?\nStudent：I just thought since E is on the median from A to D, the direction from E to B would point along AB.\nTeacher：Your reasoning incorrectly assumes that the direction of $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ is the same as $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, without considering the actual position of point $E$ relative to $B$. Can you explain how you determined the relationship between vectors $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AB}$?\nStudent：I just assumed the relationship based on their locations, without using any formulas or breakdowns.\nTeacher：Your reasoning incorrectly assumes that the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ can be directly inferred from the position of $E$ on $AD$ without considering the full geometric relationships or vector decomposition. Can you explain how you determined the coordinates or position vectors of points involved?\nStudent：I did not calculate the coordinates or position vectors for any of the points; I only looked at their names and locations in the triangle.\nTeacher：Your mistake is assuming that the vector $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ can be determined solely by the names and relative positions of points without using vector decomposition or coordinate analysis.\nStudent：zzc",
