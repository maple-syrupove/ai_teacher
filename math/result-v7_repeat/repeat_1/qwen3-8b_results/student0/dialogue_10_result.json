    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by differentiating $f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^2+\\sin x}{x^2+1}$ directly, but the derivative got messy. I wasn't able to get a final answer for $M+m$.\nTeacher：What did you do with the derivative once you found it?\nStudent：After finding the derivative, I tried to set it to zero and solve for $x$, but the equation became very complicated and I couldn’t solve it completely.\nTeacher：It seems you attempted to find critical points by setting the derivative to zero, but you didn’t consider simplifying the derivative or analyzing its behavior. Could you explain how you approached simplifying the derivative?\nStudent：I didn't really try to simplify the derivative; I just applied the quotient rule directly to $f(x)$ and ended up with a long, complicated expression.\nTeacher：It appears you didn't consider simplifying the derivative before attempting to solve for critical points. Could you explain how you handled the numerator and denominator of the derivative?\nStudent：I differentiated the numerator and denominator separately using the quotient rule, combining them into a single big fraction. I didn't factor or simplify either part before or after.\nTeacher：It seems you didn't consider simplifying the derivative or analyzing its structure before attempting to solve for critical points. Could you explain how you approached simplifying the numerator of the derivative?\nStudent：I just left the numerator as it was after applying the product and chain rules; I didn’t try to factor or rearrange it.\nTeacher：It seems you didn’t consider simplifying or analyzing the structure of the derivative before attempting to solve for critical points. Could you explain how you approached simplifying the denominator of the derivative?\nStudent：I just differentiated the denominator as $2x$, and used it in the quotient rule without simplifying further.\nTeacher：It seems you didn’t consider simplifying or analyzing the structure of the derivative before attempting to solve for critical points. Could you explain how you approached simplifying the numerator of the derivative?\nStudent：I only expanded and differentiated directly; I didn’t try to factor or rewrite the numerator to make things simpler.\nTeacher：It seems you didn’t consider simplifying or analyzing the structure of the derivative before attempting to solve for critical points. Could you explain how you approached simplifying the numerator of the derivative?\nStudent：I only performed the differentiation step-by-step; I didn't attempt to combine like terms or look for patterns to simplify the numerator.\nTeacher：It seems you didn't consider simplifying the derivative or analyzing its structure before attempting to solve for critical points. Could you explain how you approached simplifying the numerator of the derivative?\nStudent：I calculated the derivative term by term and just kept the result messy, without simplifying or restructuring it further.\nTeacher：It seems you didn't consider simplifying the derivative or analyzing its structure before attempting to solve for critical points. Could you explain how you approached simplifying the numerator of the derivative?\nStudent：I applied the differentiation rules to each term and kept the resulting expression as it was, without any simplification or structural changes.\nTeacher：It seems you didn’t consider simplifying the derivative or analyzing its structure before attempting to solve for critical points. Could you explain how you approached simplifying the numerator of the derivative?\nStudent：I differentiated each term in the numerator and left the result as it was, without simplifying or finding common factors.\nTeacher：It seems you didn’t consider simplifying the derivative or analyzing its structure before attempting to solve for critical points. Could you explain how you approached simplifying the numerator of the derivative?\nStudent：I applied the basic differentiation separately for each term in the numerator and didn’t attempt to simplify or restructure the result.\nTeacher：It seems you didn’t consider simplifying the derivative or analyzing its structure before attempting to solve for critical points.
