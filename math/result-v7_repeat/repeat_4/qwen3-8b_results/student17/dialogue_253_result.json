    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：A. $\\sqrt{5}$\nTeacher：To determine the student's error, let's consider the approach to solving for $\\tan B$. What method did you use to find $\\tan B$?\nStudent：I tried to use the Law of Cosines to find a side first.\nTeacher：What side did you calculate using the Law of Cosines?\nStudent：I tried to calculate side $a$ first.\nTeacher：I see. What value did you obtain for side $a$?\nStudent：I couldn't get the value for side $a$ because $\\cos A$ was unknown.\nTeacher：It seems you attempted to use the Law of Cosines but encountered a dependency on $\\cos A$, which was not provided. Let's clarify: which side did you intend to calculate first, and why?\nStudent：I intended to calculate side $a$ first because I usually start with that when solving triangles.\nTeacher：You intended to calculate side $a$ first, but in $\\triangle ABC$, side $a$ is opposite angle $A$, not angle $C$. Since $\\cos C$ is given, you should have started by finding side $c$ using the Law of Cosines. This was your key error.\nStudent：zzc",
