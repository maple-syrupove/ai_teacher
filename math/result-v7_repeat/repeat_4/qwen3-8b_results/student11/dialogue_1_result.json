    "question": "14. (5 points) Let the function y=f(x) be represented by a continuous curve on the interval (0,1], and it always holds that $0 \\leqslant f(x) \\leqslant 1$. We can use a random simulation method (Monte Carlo method) to calculate the area S of the region enclosed by the curve y=f(x) and the lines x=0, x=1, and y=0. First, generate two sets of N uniform random numbers each on the interval (0, 1]: $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{N}$ and $y_{1}, y_{2}, \\ldots, y_{N}$. This gives N points $(x_i, y_i)$ for $i=1, 2, \\ldots, N$. Then, count the number of points, $N_1$, that satisfy the condition $y_i \\leqslant f(x_i)$ for $i=1, 2, \\ldots, N$. The approximate value of S obtained by this random simulation method is\n",
