    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I tried to find the extrema by directly differentiating $f(x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2+1}$ and setting the derivative to zero, but I couldn't get a specific value for $M + m$.\nTeacher：What did you obtain for the derivative $ f'(x) $?\nStudent：I calculated $f'(x) = \\frac{2(x+1)(x^2+1) + \\cos x (x^2+1) - 2x((x+1)^2+\\sin x)}{(x^2+1)^2}$.\nTeacher：Your derivative is incorrect. Let's check the numerator. What is the derivative of the numerator $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x$?\nStudent：The derivative of the numerator $(x+1)^2 + \\sin x$ is $2(x+1) + \\cos x$.\nTeacher：Your derivative of the numerator is correct. Now, what is the derivative of the denominator $x^2 + 1$?\nStudent：The derivative of the denominator $x^2 + 1$ is $2x$.\nTeacher：Your derivative of the denominator is correct. Now, let's revisit the numerator of $ f'(x) $. What is the full expression for the numerator of $ f'(x) $ using the quotient rule?\nStudent：The numerator should be $\\left[2(x+1)+\\cos x\\right](x^2+1) - 2x\\left((x+1)^2+\\sin x\\right)$.\nTeacher：Your expression for the numerator of $ f'(x) $ is correct. Now, let's simplify it step by step. What is the simplified form of the numerator?\nStudent：The simplified form is $2(x+1)(x^2+1) + \\cos x(x^2+1) - 2x(x+1)^2 - 2x\\sin x$.\nTeacher：Your simplification is correct. Now, let's consider the symmetry of the function. Did you check if $ f(x) + f(-x) $ is constant?\nStudent：No, I didn't check if $f(x) + f(-x)$ is constant.\nTeacher：You missed a key insight: checking if $ f(x) + f(-x) $ is constant. This could simplify finding $ M + m $. Let's explore this.\nStudent：Okay. Should I compute $f(-x)$ and then add it to $f(x)$?\nTeacher：Yes, compute $ f(-x) $ and add it to $ f(x) $. What do you get for $ f(x) + f(-x) $?\nStudent：Let me calculate:  \n$f(-x) = \\frac{(-x+1)^2 + \\sin(-x)}{x^2+1} = \\frac{(x-1)^2 - \\sin x}{x^2+1}$.  \nSo, $f(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + \\sin x}{x^2+1} + \\frac{(x-1)^2 - \\sin x}{x^2+1}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly computed $ f(-x) $. Now, simplify the expression for $ f(x) + f(-x) $. What do you get?\nStudent：$f(x) + f(-x) = \\frac{(x+1)^2 + (x-1)^2}{x^2+1} = \\frac{x^2+2x+1 + x^2-2x+1}{x^2+1} = \\frac{2x^2+2}{x^2+1}$.\nTeacher：You have correctly simplified $ f(x) + f(-x) $. Now, simplify $ \\frac{2x^2+2}{x^2+1} $. What is the result?\nStudent：$\\frac{2x^2+2}{x^2+1} = 2$.\nTeacher：You have correctly shown that $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $. Therefore, the sum of the maximum and minimum values of $ f(x) $ is $ M + m = 2 $.\nStudent：Okay, thank you.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $, which implies $ M + m = 2 $. Your reasoning is sound and the conclusion is accurate.\nStudent：Okay, thank you.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $, which implies $ M + m = 2 $. Your reasoning is sound and the conclusion is accurate.\nStudent：Okay, thank you.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that $ f(x) + f(-x) = 2 $, which implies $ M + m = 2 $.
