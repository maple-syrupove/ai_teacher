    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose A. $i(1+i)^2$.\nTeacher：Let me ask you: What is the value of $ (1+i)^2 $?\nStudent：$(1+i)^2 = 1^2 + 2 \\times 1 \\times i + i^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2$. Since $i^2 = -1$, it equals $1 + 2i -1 = 2i$.\nTeacher：Then, what is $ i(1+i)^2 $?\nStudent：$i(1+i)^2 = i \\times 2i = 2i^2 = 2(-1) = -2$.\nTeacher：Then, what type of number is $-2$?\nStudent：$-2$ is a real number.\nTeacher：Then, what type of number is $-2$?\nStudent：$-2$ is a real number.\nTeacher：Then, what is the mistake in your conclusion about option A?\nStudent：I don't know.\nTeacher：Option A evaluates to a real number, not a purely imaginary number. You correctly calculated $ i(1+i)^2 = -2 $, which is real. Therefore, your choice of A is incorrect. What do you think is the correct answer?\nStudent：Let me check each option carefully. For B: $i^2(1-i) = (-1)(1-i) = -1 + i$. This is not purely imaginary. For C: $(1+i)^2 = 2i$, which is purely imaginary. So, C is the correct answer.\nTeacher：You correctly identified that option C evaluates to $2i$, which is purely imaginary. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\nStudent：Thank you, I understand now.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified that option C evaluates to $2i$, which is purely imaginary.
