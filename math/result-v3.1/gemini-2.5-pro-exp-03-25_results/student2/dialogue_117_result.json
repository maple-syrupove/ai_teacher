    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：I chose C.\nTeacher：Hello. Let's take a look at this problem together.\n\nTo start, could you tell me which trigonometric identity or formula you applied to the expression $\\cos ^{2}\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$?\nStudent：I used the identity $\\cos^2 A = 1 - \\sin^2 A$ for the expression $\\cos^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$.\nTeacher：That is a valid identity. After rewriting the expression as $1 - \\sin^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$, how did you proceed with the $\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ term?\nStudent：I substituted the value $\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$ directly into $\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$.\nTeacher：For that substitution to be mathematically valid, what must be true about the relationship between the expression $\\sin^2\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ and the expression $\\sin 2\\alpha$?\nStudent：For the substitution to be valid, $\\sin(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$ would need to be equal to $\\sin 2\\alpha$, or at least there would need to be a direct relationship or identity linking them that justifies using the value $\\sin 2\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$ in place of $\\sin(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the required condition for your substitution to be valid.\n\nLet's be very specific then. Is there an established trigonometric identity that states that $\\sin\\left(2\\alpha\\right)$ is equal to $\\sin\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$?\nStudent：No, there is no identity that states $\\sin(2\\alpha) = \\sin\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$. They are not generally equal for all $\\alpha$.\nTeacher：You have correctly identified the flaw in your procedure.\n\nYour error was substituting the value of $\\sin(2\\alpha)$ into your expression based on the incorrect assumption that $\\sin\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ and $\\sin(2\\alpha)$ are equivalent.\nStudent：zzc",
