    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was: \"φ cannot be solved.\"\nTeacher：Hello. Let's take a look at this problem. Could you first tell me what the equation of the graph becomes after it is shifted to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units?\nStudent：After shifting the graph of $y = \\cos(2x + \\phi)$ to the right by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ units, the new equation becomes $y = \\cos\\left(2(x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\phi\\right) = \\cos\\left(2x - \\pi + \\phi\\right)$.\nTeacher：Very good. That's the correct equation for the shifted graph. How did you then use this expression in relation to the function $y=\\sin \\left(2 x+\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$?\nStudent：At this point, I noticed that the forms of the two functions were different—one was in terms of cosine and the other in terms of sine. Since I didn't see a way to solve for $\\phi$ directly due to the different forms, I concluded that $\\phi$ could not be solved.\nTeacher：You are correct that for the two graphs to coincide, the expression `y = cos(2x - π + φ)` must be equivalent to `y = sin(2x + π/3)`.\n\nMy question for you is: Are there any general mathematical rules or identities that connect the sine function and the cosine function?\nStudent：Yes, there are general identities connecting the sine and cosine functions. For example, one well-known identity is $\\sin\\theta = \\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. This allows you to express a sine function as a cosine function (or vice versa) with a shifted argument.\nTeacher：That is the correct identity and a perfect description of its use.\n\nSo, you knew that you could convert a sine function into a cosine function. Why, then, did you conclude that the problem could not be solved when you were faced with one of each?\nStudent：At that time, I didn't think of actually applying that identity to transform the sine function into a cosine function (or vice versa). I saw the difference in forms and thought I couldn't set up a direct equation between them, which led me to believe that φ could not be solved.\nTeacher：Thank you. It sounds like you had all the necessary tools at your disposal.\n\nYour mistake was that you prematurely concluded the problem was unsolvable due to the different forms of the functions, rather than applying the trigonometric identity you already knew to make them comparable.\nStudent：zzc",
