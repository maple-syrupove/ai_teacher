    "history_prompt": "\nStudent：My answer was D: $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$ is an odd function.\nTeacher：Hello. To begin, can you tell me the definition of an odd function? What is the mathematical relationship that must be true for a function `h(x)` to be considered odd?\nStudent：Sure. For a function $h(x)$ to be considered odd, it must satisfy $h(-x) = -h(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\nTeacher：Excellent. That is the correct definition.\n\nNow, let's apply this definition to the function in your answer, option D. If we set $h(x) = |f(x) \\bullet g(x)|$, what is the expression for $h(-x)$?\nStudent：If $h(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$, then $h(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)|$.\nTeacher：That's a great start. Given that $f(x)$ is an odd function and $g(x)$ is an even function, how can you rewrite $f(-x)$ and $g(-x)$?\nStudent：Since $f(x)$ is an odd function, $f(-x) = -f(x)$; and since $g(x)$ is an even function, $g(-x) = g(x)$.\nTeacher：Very good. Now, can you substitute these expressions for $f(-x)$ and $g(-x)$ back into the equation for $h(-x)$ that you gave me earlier? What does the expression for $h(-x)$ become?\nStudent：Sure. Substituting these in, $h(-x) = |f(-x) \\cdot g(-x)| = |(-f(x)) \\cdot g(x)| = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：Excellent. Now you have the expression `h(-x) = |-f(x) \\cdot g(x)|`.\n\nMy question is about the property of the absolute value function itself. How does the absolute value function affect the negative sign in your resulting expression?\nStudent：The absolute value function eliminates the negative sign, so $|-f(x) \\cdot g(x)| = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\nTeacher：You have correctly shown that if we let $h(x) = |f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$, then the resulting expression for $h(-x)$ is $|f(x) \\cdot g(x)|$.\n\nYour mistake was concluding that the function is odd. Based on your own steps, you have demonstrated that $h(-x) = h(x)$, but the definition of an odd function, which you correctly stated, is $h(-x) = -h(x)$.\nStudent：zzc",
