Could you clarify how you connected these two expressions?\nStudent：I thought that $\\sin 2\\alpha$ could somehow be directly substituted when I saw $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$, so I tried plugging in the value $\\frac{2}{3}$ for $\\sin 2\\alpha$ in place of $\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4})$.\nTeacher：You attempted to substitute $\\sin 2\\alpha$ directly into an expression involving $\\sin^2(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$, which is not a valid substitution.
