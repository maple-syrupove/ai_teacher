Instead, they used a flawed 'numeric intuition' strategy of directly dividing the respective parts of the numerator and denominator. This reflects an insufficient understanding of the problem's structure and a failure to apply a standard problem-solving strategy, leading to a mechanical decomposition and incorrect assembly of the result.",
