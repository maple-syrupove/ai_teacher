        "Reason for Error Caused by Error Dimension": "The student lacks strategic experience and struggles to quickly perform structural transformations on complex fractional expressions. They did not choose an appropriate transformation method, missing the opportunity to simplify the calculation and use the function's properties to solve the problem, getting bogged down in tedious mechanical operations which led to failure.",

        "Reason for Error Caused by Error Dimension": "The student lacks an overall problem-solving strategy for effectively narrowing down the range and carefully comparing set members.

They then directly substituted \\sin 2\\alpha=\\frac{2}{3} into \\sin^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}), mistakenly assuming they were equivalent, which made it impossible to calculate the correct answer or led to incorrectly choosing C (\\frac{1}{2}).",
        "Reason for Error Caused by Error Dimension": "The student failed to recognize the relationship between the double-angle formula used in this problem and the terms \\sin 2\\alpha and \\cos^2(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}).

This led to applying an invalid equality, getting stuck in a conceptual trap, and having to randomly pick an answer (like C).",

        "Reason for Error Caused by Error Dimension": "When facing a combinatorics problem, the student lacked the strategy to recognize special number combinations (Pythagorean triples). They did not proactively use the formula to check. After trying all combinations, they found multiple answers, but in fact, only (3,4,5) fit.
